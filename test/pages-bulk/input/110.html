happen only in the Alberta foothills. Underfoot, bunchgrass and sage. Overhead,
endless stars. Slim Davis and I wander in the twilight toward his back-forty,
in&nbsp; the direction of the western hills. From Davis’s ranch, a few
miles west of Red Deer,&nbsp; the bulk of the Rockies rises 100 miles away,
looking like the shoulders of some ancient sleeping behemoth. Up through

<br><a NAME="cont'd"></a><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quiet,
quiet. The mare steps through the dark. She whinnies her pleasure at Davis’s
familiar scent,&nbsp; flinching&nbsp; for a few seconds, unsure of my presence.
Davis reaches out a reassuring hand, running it lightly up her side, over
her mottled gray spots, up the quivering neck. Combing his fingers through
the tangled shag on her neck, he whispers to me, in the darkness, “These
here are witches’ tails, these tangles. They’re from when the witches ride
‘em at night. Only the real wild ones have ‘em. That’s how you tell.”</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Davis’s wild mare is
likely the only true mustang (Mustang - from the Spanish, monstrenco -
“roving, rough, wild”) in captivity. True to her spirit, she escapes regularly,
but she always comes back to him. “The wild instinct is in her. I never
did break her,” he laughs.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp; The species the mare represents is typically
small in stature, with a stocky build, large head and flowing mane and
tail almost reaching the ground. Her kind are&nbsp; plain rugged, hardly
the Hollywood movie version of the Western horse. Their rough-cast stoutness
is the very quality that has allowed them&nbsp; to survive the fierce strenuousness
of the Old West and the less picturesque cruelties of modern times.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certain wildlife officials
and sport hunters have claimed the wild horses of Western Canada are merely
feral -&nbsp; just&nbsp; runaway packing horses from old logging and mining
camps.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Davis’s lean, scruffy
ponies of the foothills are indeed the true item. His mustangs are the
tough, rough mares and stallions of legendary Indian days, not at all like
the bovine scrags&nbsp; commonly called “mustangs” by some.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, Alberta’s
population of feral&nbsp; runaway horses hogs the public attention&nbsp;
that ought to go to the real mustangs. Most notably, the runaways roaming
the fenced-in grasslands of CFB Suffield,&nbsp; northwest of Calgary, have
been made famous by highly publicized protests over a 1988&nbsp; roundup.
Protestors mistakenly called the heavy Suffield horses mustangs. In fact,&nbsp;
the feral horses of Suffield, with their mixed Shire,&nbsp; Suffolk and
Clydesdale bloodline, are no more mustangs&nbsp; than Old Bessie. Their
claim on Western heritage is dubious.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If anyone knows the
mustangs, Davis does. He has been their advocate for decades,&nbsp; having
been instrumental in persuading the Alberta government in 1974 to stop
issuing seasonal licences to hunt them. Still, he says, “It’s something
terrible what they’ve done to them horses. There’s not too many left. They’ve
been hunted and chased, and killed. They’re scattered and gone.” Nobody
seems to care about the mustangs, says Davis, including even the Humane
Society, who, he says, should do something about the condition in which
horses often arrive at auction houses. They’re too often delivered to auction
bleeding, crippled, and blinded by&nbsp; their frantic struggling against
the leg snares hunters use to trap them, says Davis.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Davis, born in 1908 to a horseman’s
family, grew up&nbsp; alongside the Blood, Blackfoot, Cree and Stoney Indians
of&nbsp; Alberta, peoples whose traditional history and culture began and
ended&nbsp; with the tough little mustangs of the wild.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1920,&nbsp; Slim first
encountered the wild ponies. In those days wild horses numbered in the
tens of thousands in the Alberta foothills.&nbsp; “This ol’ Indian said&nbsp;
the little horses had been there as long as the Indians could remember,
and probably long before,” he said.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Indians told him no one
was certain where the&nbsp; horses had come from, historically speaking,
but they knew that the horses figured big in ancient legends.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The American West had once
been a virtual wild horse dominion. As late as the turn of the 19th century,
enormous herds of mustangs, possibly numbering in the millions,&nbsp; roamed
the prairies alongside the immense herds of buffalo. Indian Days were Mustang
Days.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The situation a century
later is startling. Only a few hundred&nbsp; mustangs have survived the
twentieth century, roving the&nbsp; foothills of Alberta and B.C.</font>
<br><a NAME="SCALPED"></a><font color="#CC0000">Today Western Canada’s
wild&nbsp; horses&nbsp;<a NAME="scalped2"></a>are hunted, scalped, and
skinned like muskrats.</font><font color="#000000">&nbsp; Nature and history
have colluded to make the remaining few mustangs the most aloof of creatures.&nbsp;
Their continued survival&nbsp; depends on their need to remain free. They
literally can’t survive in captivity, as they “will” themselves to die
in&nbsp; conditions of confinement or duress.</font>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp; Modern archaeology looks to fossil remains
from sediments in Wyoming suggesting that Equus Caballus, the horse, was
native to North America 60 million years ago. The&nbsp; horse alternately
appears and disappears from the fossil record at about one million year
intervals. All trace of&nbsp; the horse is lost by about 25,000 years ago.
The species was unknown to the American continent when&nbsp; Columbus sailed
from Spain on his voyage of discovery.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But&nbsp; historians say that
Columbus , and even the subsequent Spanish explorers, Coronado and DeSoto,&nbsp;
couldn’t themselves have reintroduced the&nbsp; lost species to North America.
They argue that, although the earliest Spanish explorers did indeed bring
horses with them to the New World, they brought only limited&nbsp; numbers
of the animals, and very few of those were mares.&nbsp; Coronado, for example,&nbsp;
wrote in his diary that he had brought “five&nbsp; hundred and fifty-eight
horses, two of them mares.” Two mares could hardly have stocked the whole&nbsp;
continent,&nbsp; say historians.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More likely sources for the
North American population of ponies, say historians, were stock-raising
ranches established by the Spanish in the Santa Fe area between the 1550s
and the 1700s. The ranches furnished ideal conditions for the spread of
horses to the rest of the continent : friendly contact with the Indians
through trade, an ample supply of horses, and plenty of opportunities for
the Indians to study possible uses for the new creature.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Logically, the movement of
horses into the North Americas would have followed established&nbsp; inter-
tribal trade routes. From Spanish records we know that, beginning around
1600, southwest tribes such as the Utes, Comanches, Apaches and Kiowas
began raiding the Spanish ranches and stealing large numbers of horses.
From those&nbsp; tribes, the horses slowly spread across the continent.
La Verendrye reported that tribes living northeast of the&nbsp; Black Hills
in Montana had no horses when he visited them in 1738. Yet just 16 years
later in 1754 Anthony Henday, the Hudson’s Bay Company explorer, met Assiniboines
in the same area who had horses, though they used them only for packing,
not for riding. By 1766 Henday reported numerous Assiniboines now skillfully
riding the horses.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several Indian tribes have
oral traditions chronicling their first acquisition of horses : Tetons
say they got theirs from the Arikaras; Shoshonis from Comanches, and Nez
Perces from Shoshonis.</font>
<br><a NAME="In 1827 an American trader, Robert Meldrum, reported that old Crow people told him their generation was the  first generation of"></a><font color="#000000">In
1827 an American trader, Robert Meldrum, reported that old Crow people
told him their generation was the&nbsp; first generation of Crows to see
horses.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it was that the hardy Spanish
ponies gradually populated the North American continent, as possessions
of the native peoples.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wild herds of escapees were
reported by the late 1800s, though they were mostly ignored by the Indians,
as&nbsp; domestic ponies were plentiful and easier to handle.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually horse- stealing
became the foremost means to&nbsp; acquire more horses, and full blown
“horse culture” was in full swing among the Indian tribes by the end of
the century. The “Indian pony” - small, squat&nbsp; and&nbsp; tough -&nbsp;
became the mainstay of Indian life, indispensable in transport, warfare,
leisure, hunting, religion and trade.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So it was
practically inevitable that Indians began to measure wealth by the number
of horses a man owned. The number of horses owned by individual Indians
grew dramatically.</font><a NAME="indians"></a>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the Piegan people the horse-to-people
ratio grew from about 1-1 in 1860 to 3.5-1 by 1895. But a wealthy individual
might easily have as many as 500 horses in his personal herd. In the Indian
economy, if a man had a lot of horses, he had prestige, and could thus
attract more wives, have more children, produce more meat and produce more
trade goods. A man with a substantial herd was affluent.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The summer of 1886 was
a hot one on the prairies, just 22 years before Slim Davis’s birth in Carmangay,
Alberta.&nbsp; That year saw the last major horse-raiding party of the
Old West. Canadian Piegans rode down out of the Calgary area to the Pryor
Creek area of northern Montana. They made off with 60 horses stolen from
the Crows camped there. To this day a mysterious herd of wild horses is
known to exist in the Pryor Mountain area. Some Crows say these horses
must be descendants of&nbsp; the surviving stock of the Custer battle at
Bighorn, which took place just a few miles away.</font>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maddeningly, it is the argument
over the bloodline of the wild horses that is used today by sport hunters
and commercial hunters to rationalize their slaughter.”What are you protecting
anyway?” asked Gerry Kemp, senior wildlife management biologist with the
Alberta lands and forests&nbsp; department in 1974. “So-called wild horses
are only the&nbsp; descendants of work animals from farms, or lumbering
or&nbsp; mining operations that have been turned into the wild and&nbsp;
survived.”<a NAME="KEMP"></a></font><font color="#CC0000">The best thing
that could be done with wild&nbsp; horses would be to “shoot ‘em all” said
Kemp.</font><img SRC="killers.gif" height=180 width=180 align=TEXTTOP>
<br><a NAME="accordingly"></a><font color="#000000"> Mustangs have, accordingly,
been shot for target practice, bated with poison for predators, slaughtered
for dog food, chased and tormented - subjected to every kind of maltreatment
know to man. Objections have been raised&nbsp; on the grounds of cruelty,
but professional wild horse hunters shrug their critics off. “Round ‘em
up, and shoot a tranquilizer into them, and those horses don’t give a damn
whether they end up as dog food or rodeo buckers,” one big game hunter
remarked to a Calgary reporter.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1950s, the slaughter
reached high gear when hunters discovered that the horses could be panicked
by dive-bombing airplanes. Terrified horses were buzzed from above, and
raced&nbsp; cross-country until, at the point of exhaustion, they could
be driven into corals. Frantic, the horses were&nbsp; loaded into waiting
trucks for transport to auction or slaughterhouses. Many would arrive at
the slaughterhouse&nbsp; already dead, trampled to death in transit. It
was not an&nbsp; uncommon sight to see the trucks dripping blood on the&nbsp;
highways.</font>
<br><font color="#CC0000">Some&nbsp;<a NAME="DEAD"></a>of the trampled
horses had simply dropped dead of fright.</font><font color="#000000">
Mustangs have this peculiar will to die - so&nbsp; sensitive and vulnerable
are they to pursuit and capture.&nbsp; Explorer David Thompson documented
this&nbsp; amazing vulnerability of mustangs as early as 1809. He wrote
in his diary&nbsp; while crossing the West that wild horses froze as if&nbsp;
paralyzed when his men merely “shouted a halloa” and dashed at them. He
was only the first of many horse&nbsp; runners to report the phenomenon.
Modern hunters still&nbsp; observe that stallions, in particular, commonly
seem&nbsp; unable to survive the ordeal of being captured and will&nbsp;
to die within hours or days of being deprived of their&nbsp; freedom. Whole
bands have collapsed in paroxysms of fear&nbsp; when subjected to the experience
of being rounded up and corralled.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chief&nbsp; forester in 1959
, W.R. Hanson said, “They [protesters] talk about inhumane&nbsp; methods,
or protest emotionally to the government against&nbsp; the ‘extinction’
of one of the features of the old wild&nbsp; west...[but] there is nothing
cruel about the airplane&nbsp; roundup. The only part you might have doubt
about is the&nbsp; loading of the frightened animals onto trucks.”&nbsp;
Nevertheless,&nbsp; the dive-bombing bloodbaths were brought to an end
in 1959. Forest conservation officials felt pressured&nbsp; by&nbsp; public
cries for more compassionate treatment of&nbsp; the mustangs, and, magnanimously,
decreed that roundup by cattle horse, not by dive-bombers,&nbsp; was the
only humane way to go.</font>
<br><a NAME="The numbers of  mustangs has been in dispute for more than a century"></a><font color="#000000">The
numbers of&nbsp; mustangs has been in dispute for more than a century.&nbsp;
A 1895 police census showed 42,257 wild horses on the range in Southern
Alberta. In 1958 a roundup expert said huge tracts of Alberta land carried
vast wild horse herds. “The whole place is a wild horse kingdom,” said
Chester Utter in a report in The Albertan newspaper in August, 1958. Utter
boasted that he alone had rounded up more than 40,000 horses. One year
later, in 1959, the Calgary Herald carried a front-page story saying the
horses were “facing extinction.” The next year, 1960, the Alberta Cattlemen’s
Association said there were some 3,000 still roaming at will. By 1977,
The Herald thought that about 1,000 head of wild horses roamed the foothills.
In 1991 Alberta Fish and Wildlife counted 300 mustangs roaming free in
Kananaskis Country.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1974, Calgary Socred MLA
Art Dixon agreed with&nbsp; the mid-70s figure of “about 1,000”, but argued
that if&nbsp; the annual hunt continued the horses would soon be wiped&nbsp;
out. Spurred on by Slim Davis and the thousands of names he had collected
on a petition, Dixon successfully lobbied the Alberta legislature to&nbsp;
stop the regular issuing of hunting permits for wild horses.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With this regulatory move
in 1974, horses roaming on&nbsp; Crown lands in Alberta could no longer
be legally hunted. But horses straying onto private lands were, and still
are,&nbsp; treated&nbsp; as fair game for hunters, in season year- round.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A private members’ bill passed
by the Klein government in 1993 making the capture of horses on public
land more&nbsp; than just a minor regulatory infraction&nbsp; merely re-jigs
the 1974 regulation. Mustangs that make the horrible mistake of straying
onto private property are still legal prey for hunters in Alberta.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp; In B.C., in 1988 the Vancouver Sun
reported three herds of&nbsp; mustangs ranging the Chilcotin district .
The largest of the herds, the Red Brush herd, numbered 150. Two smaller
herds, the<a NAME="Bidwell and Haines Creek herds, were legally massacred in 1988"></a>Bidwell
and Haines Creek herds, were legally massacred in 1988, reducing their
combined&nbsp; numbers from well over 100 to 35. Regional wildlife&nbsp;
officials authorized the 1988 roundup, claiming the horses&nbsp; were reducing
valuable grazing land during a severe&nbsp; drought.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wild horse lovers passionately
challenge hunters’ claims that most mustangs are&nbsp; just feral rejects,
not living descendants of heritage stock.</font>
<br><a NAME="Hope Ryden on the purity of the mustang pedigree"></a><font color="#000000">American
wild horse advocate Hope Ryden attacked the&nbsp; “feral” argument in the
1970s.&nbsp; Ryden, who worked as&nbsp;&nbsp; features producer for ABC
News from 1966 to 1968, argued&nbsp; persuasively in her book America’s
Last Wild Horses&nbsp; that the very fact that these horses have prevailed
for so&nbsp; long against so many odds - hunters, bitter weather, rough&nbsp;
terrain, extensive grazing competition and high infant&nbsp; mortality&nbsp;
- suggests that they must come from&nbsp; exceptionally hardy stock, namely,
the Spanish stock of&nbsp; the original Indian ponies. Rejects from domestic
herds, she argues, would never have survived over the years under&nbsp;
such conditions.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “It was the animal that
was originally&nbsp; the most ‘Western’ that survived the harsh test of
the&nbsp; wild. The big, slow gentle farm horses and the high - strung,
grain-fed horses were not creatures that could&nbsp; easily adapt to bleak
habitats and rugged winters,” wrote Ryden.</font>
<br><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ryden further warranted the
purity of the mustang pedigree based on the fact that there has been no
genetic&nbsp; break in the continuity of the wild horse bloodline from
the last century to this century. Since&nbsp; the West was opened, she
pointed out, though the total&nbsp; number of wild horses has dwindled
drastically the wild&nbsp; horse population did not at any time vanish.
Therefore, she said, the mustang bloodline&nbsp; extends perfectly from
the 16th century to present day. From Columbus to Slim Davis’s mare - one
unbroken genetic heritage.</font>

all up : “I&nbsp; spent a lot of time in the mountains in the last 50 years
or so. The wildlife is nearly gone. It’s four years since&nbsp; I seen
a mountain goat. There are some mountain sheep&nbsp; left, but with all
the trophy sheep huntin’ now, they’ll&nbsp; be gone soon, too. Now it’s
the horses. They got a right&nbsp;&nbsp; to live, that’s all.”</font>

confessed to the Calgary Albertan that he “liked” the little ponies. Still,

trigger. But it’s over in a second.”</font>
