        <P>The film and audio recordings collected in <EM>Inventing Entertainment</EM> 
          provide opportunities to chronicle the evolution of the motion picture 
          industry and its influence on popular entertainment. Footage of vaudeville 
          performers provides a catalyst to assess the demise of theatrical film 
          during the early-twentieth century. Films of the Western genre can prompt 
          a discussion on how certain styles transcend the media after entering 
          the nation's cultural vocabulary. Additional films can be analyzed to 
          discuss the merits of public executions and to research historic firsts 
          in technology and popular entertainment. </P>

	  <H4>Historical Analysis and Interpretation: The American West</H4>



	  <P>During the nineteenth century, popular entertainment such as dime novels and stage 

	  plays established the Western genre while blurring the line between fact and fiction.

	  For example, William Cody was a soldier, hunter, and Indian scout whose exploits were 

	  celebrated and exaggerated in Ned Buntline's <EM>Buffalo Bill</EM> dime novels. In 1872, Cody 

	  first portrayed Buffalo Bill on stage. He successfully adopted the public persona for future 

	  performances and later wrote his own dime novels and an autobiography about frontier life.

	  He also established "Buffalo Bill's Wild West" in 1883.

	  "faithful duplication of the genuine 'Hold Ups' made famous by various outlaw bands in

	  directly at the camera. Edison's catalog explains that the image can be used at the

	    <P> This collection contains battle scenes from the Boer War of South 

          Africa, the Spanish-American War, and the United States campaign in 

          the Philippines. These historical reenactments provided an opportunity 

          to capitalize on an audience's interest in news events without jeopardizing 

          the safety of a cameraman and his equipment.

	        <TD align=left vAlign=top width="71%"> Coney Island was a popular
