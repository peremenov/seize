        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">At its meeting on
        Thursday, January 25, 2001, the Senate of the Academic
        Council heard reports and took the following actions: </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. Upon recommendation
        of the Committee on Undergraduate Studies, and by
        unanimous voice vote, approved the initiation of the
        Interdisciplinary Program in Archaeology and authorized
        the Executive Committee of the Interdisciplinary Program
        in Archaeology to nominate candidates for the B. A.

        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Senate Chair Brad Osgood
        called the meeting to order at 3:24 p.m. in Room 180 of
        the Law School. There were 31 voting members, 8<i>
        ex-officio</i> members, and a large number of guests in
        attendance. Osgood welcomed new School of Education Dean
        Deborah Stipek to her first Senate meeting, and she was
        greeted with a round of applause. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Approval of Minutes </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The minutes of the
        January 11, 2000 meeting of Senate XXXIII (SenD#5159)
        were approved as submitted. The Chair advised that the
        Memorial Resolution on the agenda was being rescheduled
        to the next meeting. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Report from the Senate
        Steering Committee </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Osgood thanked those at
        SLAC for the very successful Senate meeting and tour on
        January 11th. He joked that if the next Senate
        &quot;field trip&quot; couldn't be to Hawaii, he might
        try to arrange for the Athletic Director to take everyone
        to the Final Four. Osgood informed Senate members that
        their Fall Quarter discussion on advising had led to the
        recent activation of the C-US Subcommittee on Residential
        Education and Advising (S-REA). It had been charged among
        other things to &quot;develop strategies for faculty
        mentoring of freshmen and sophomores&quot; and to
        &quot;plan a program to increase the quality of mentoring
        at the upper levels.&quot; The subcommittee, chaired by
        Professor Elizabeth Bernhardt, includes faculty members
        Brad Gregory (History), Lynn Hildemann (Civil and
        Environmental Engineering), Doug Osheroff (Physics),
        Senior Lecturer Julie Kennedy (Earth Systems), three
        students, and three <i>ex-officio </i>staff members.
        Osgood indicated that Director of Undergraduate Advising
        Lori White welcomed the assistance of the subcommittee as
        well as input from any and all faculty members. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Chair also reported
        that the Executive Committee of the Planning and Policy
        Board, consisting of himself and former Senate Chairs
        Zoback and Efron, had considered suggestions for
        potential PPB topics, but had decided not to convene PPB
        starting in the Fall. He said that they anticipated the
        possibility of PPB being appointed later in the year in
        connection with the results of the Provost's University
        Needs Assessment process, and that they welcomed other
        faculty suggestions. Osgood previewed upcoming Senate
        agenda items, and reminded everyone of the annual meeting
        of the Academic Council on March 8th. Vice Provost
        Bravman asked what purpose was served by the &quot;always
        empty Action Calendar&quot; on the agenda. The Academic
        Secretary explained that degrees are conferred quarterly
        under the Action Calendar, as well as occasional other
        items, which are to be voted on as presented, without
        amendment. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Report from the
        Committee on Committees </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">CoC Chair Lipsick
        advised that they had responded to the Provost's request
        for faculty members to serve on a small, ad hoc committee
        to review the maternity provisions of the tenure policy.
        CoC had also begun its regular work of identifying
        potential members for Fall 2001 vacancies on various
        committees, he said, and urged faculty members to say yes
        if asked to serve. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Reports from the
        President and the Provost </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Provost was absent.
        President Hennessy reported with relief that he had
        filled three major administrative positions. He said that
        &quot;Acting&quot; had been removed from General Counsel
        Debra Zumwalt's title, following the recommendation of a
        blue ribbon panel that examined the position. LaDoris
        Cordell would be assuming the post of Vice Provost and
        Special Counsel to the President for Campus Relations,
        Hennessy said, returning to Stanford after 19 years as a
        Santa Clara County judge. And he announced that Randy
        Livingston would arrive in mid-March as Chief Financial
        Officer and Vice President for Business Affairs. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">President Hennessy also
        spoke briefly about the California utilities crisis,
        explaining that Stanford has a Cogeneration plant, owned
        and operated by a third party, that provides power to its
        academic facilities and that sells back excess power into
        the PG&amp;E grid. &quot;In addition to avoiding rolling
        blackouts, we are part of the solution rather than part
        of the problem,&quot; he said. The university urges all
        members of the community to evaluate their usage of
        electricity and to try to conserve it, making as much
        power as possible &quot;available to our neighbors and
        the rest of the state.&quot; Hennessy indicated that
        Stanford's energy usage had gone up steadily for several
        years, and that dramatic increases in natural gas and
        electricity prices would probably result in a $5 million
        hit to the university budget. He encouraged anyone with
        ideas about ways to conserve energy to contact Chris
        Christofferson, Associate Vice Provost for Facilities
        (725-0296). Dean Orr (School of Earth Sciences) and
        Professor Noll (Economics) joked that Stanford could
        close down every Friday and get rich by selling
        electricity at &quot;extortionist prices.&quot; Hennessy
        said that unfortunately the university had a long-term
        agreement that did not include Stanford sharing in any
        profits. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Professor Rehm (Drama)
        advised the Senate of the formation of an informal
        committee of Senators including himself, Debra Satz,
        David Abernethy, Rob Polhemus, Yvonne Yarbro-Bejarano,
        David Palumbo-Liu, Bernie Roth and ASSU President Seth
        Newton, who wished to meet with the President and the
        Provost about the Nike contracts with Stanford. He
        mentioned labor problems at Nike factories, student
        protests at several universities, a citizen lawsuit
        supported by California Attorney General Lockyer, and
        several recent books and articles about college
        athletics. &quot;All of this puts some pressure on
        Stanford to justify its continuing to contract with
        Nike,&quot; he said. He also made &quot;a modest
        proposal&quot; that if Stanford needs money so badly that
        it has to sell advertising on student athlete uniforms,
        maybe it ought to approach Nike and Adidas and Reebok and
        &quot;cut a similar deal&quot; for clothing that all the
        faculty would wear, like the students. Hennessy reminded
        everyone that the university does not fund any varsity
        sports, and that Athletics is stretched to cover its
        budget commitments since advertising was removed from
        venues such as Maples Pavilion. He said that he is
        concerned that corporate sponsorship confuses the notion
        of amateur sports at the college level, but also
        recognizes that it is a reality to be contended with. He
        noted that Nike had kept Stanford apprised of labor
        issues, and he suggested that engaging with them about
        such issues might cause them to pay more attention to
        them. Hennessy asked Rehm and the group to meet with
        Athletics Director Ted Leland to inform themselves about
        athletic sponsorship agreements and relevant issues,
        adding that &quot;we will be happy to meet with any
        faculty who are concerned.&quot; Hennessy noted that he
        had read the books Rehm mentioned, and recommended the
        book by William Bowen and James Schulman, <i>The Game of
        Life: College Sports and Educational Values</i> </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">New Interdisciplinary
        Program in Archaeology (SenD#5149) </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Chair Osgood commented
        that the new interdisciplinary program recommended by the
        Committee on Undergraduate Studies draws on existing
        faculty strengths in Classics, Anthropology, and Geology,
        and reflects considerable student interest. He welcomed
        C-US Chair Hester Gelber to present the recommendation,
        along with guests including H&amp;S Associate Dean
        Russell Berman and Professors Ian Morris (Classics), Ian
        Hodder (Cultural and Social Anthropology), Gail Mahood
        (Geological and Environmental Sciences), and John Rick
        (Anthropological Sciences), all members of the program's
        executive committee. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Gelber advised that C-US
        had received a recommendation to initiate the program
        from the Humanities and Sciences Curriculum Committee and
        deans. After discussing the degree of support available
        from the relevant departments, the curriculum, provisions
        for advising, and the general quality of the program,
        they found it to be impressive and well thought through,
        she said. Berman added that H &amp; S firmly supports the
        proposal, which emanates from the Archaeology Center,
        funded in 1998/99 by seed money from the President's
        Fund. He advised that H &amp; S was prepared to provide
        base budget support as it came to better understand the
        size of student interest. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Professor Palumbo-Liu
        (Comparative Literature) offered several comments,
        including a suggestion that the foreign language
        requirement should be set at &quot;B&quot; rather than
        &quot;B minus.&quot; He also asked about financial
        arrangements for required fieldwork, encouraged more of
        an emphasis on Asia and the Pacific Rim, and suggested
        that the important course on ethics expand its focus to
        include &quot;the effects of conquest and
        imperialism.&quot; Co-Directors Morris and Hodder noted
        that fieldwork is a central part of archaeology. It was
        being arranged either on the Stanford campus with very
        low cost to students, or at overseas sites, funded in
        different ways, but generally not burdening students
        financially, except perhaps in lost opportunities for
        summer wages. They agreed that they would very much like
        to become involved in Asia, &quot;if only we can come up
        with a couple more faculty billets.&quot; Hodder
        indicated that broad attention to various ethical
        dimensions of archaeology in the modern world would be
        explored in his course. Professor Shoven (Economics) said
        that he believed the Senate should not be in the business
        of deciding specific grade requirements for courses
        within a program. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Professor Noll
        (Economics) commented that he strongly supported the new
        program, but was disappointed with two aspects of the
        proposal. First, he expressed the view that core courses
        should be offered every year, not every other year, given
        the propensity of Stanford students to have diverse
        interests and commitments off campus that could lead to
        scheduling problems in the major. Second, he said it
        appeared to him that students would be able to fulfill
        the major without actually acquiring interdisciplinary
        breadth. He suggested that breadth should be required in
        both the analytic methods and the skills courses. &quot;I
        would think that this program might want to produce a new
        kind of geologist, or a new kind of classicist, or a new
        kind of anthropologist, who was actually very skilled in
        those other fields,&quot; Noll observed. Mahood said she
        expects students to be attracted to the program at least
        in part because of dimensions beyond anthropology, such
        as earth sciences. She said that the program committee
        would be thinking about further constraints in the major
        as student interests become more clear. Hodder assured
        Noll that the notion of breadth was firmly imbedded in
        the faculty's vision for the program, even if it did not
        come through in the description. Gelber noted that C-US
        had explored similar concerns, and was satisfied that the
        student advising process would strongly guide students to
        make appropriate choices within the major. </font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1999/2000 Annual Report
        from the Committee on Academic Computing and Information
        Systems (SenD#5123) </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Senate Chair Brad
        Osgood, having served as the 1999/2000 chair of C-ACIS,
        handed the gavel to the Academic Secretary and stepped
        forward to present the committee's report. Osgood
        identified and thanked committee members and staff, and
        indicated that C-ACIS over the years &quot;cycles
        through&quot; discussion of basic computing issues such
        as infrastructure, the network and its support,
        administrative computing, general computing support, and
        network security. He explained that for C-ACIS and the
        other six Academic Council committees, important things
        often happen not as formal committee actions, but rather
        as a result of the senior administrative officers who
        serve<i> ex-officio</i> being responsive to faculty
        viewpoints and going away and &quot;getting things
        done.&quot; Osgood summarized the main themes of the
        prior year, emphasizing departmental computing support
        and &quot;computing as a public good.&quot; He provided
        some striking statistics concerning the extent of
        computing equipment requiring some level of support at
        Stanford: roughly 60,000 desktop machines (60% PC, 30%
        Mac, 10% Unix); 516 subnets with 50,000 nodes; and more
        than 100% growth in web pages and 1,000% growth in disk
        space between 1994 and 1998. The committee had considered
        two alternative models for &quot;computing as a public
        good,&quot; he said -- the library model (centrally
        funded, shared resources) versus the utilities model
        (charges for services based on usage). Osgood noted that
        this was a large topic, complicated by the significant
        variations among departments, and that discussions were
        ongoing in C-ACIS this year. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Professor Paul Segall,
        C-ACIS Chair for 2000/2001, advised that the committee
        was dividing its agenda by quarter, focusing on teaching,
        then research, then additional issues. He mentioned that
        as part of the Provost's needs assessment process, a
        subcommittee was looking at long-term infrastructure
        needs for academic computing, and hoped that as many
        faculty members as possible would respond to a survey to
        be distributed in February. Segall said that in addition
        to the ten-year horizon of the needs assessment process,
        C-ACIS hoped to prioritize some more immediate needs, and
        welcomed faculty input. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Professor Papanicolaou
        (Mathematics) expressed concern about increases in
        licensing costs for the MatLab software that were
        affecting a large number of faculty members in sciences
        and engineering. He urged C-ACIS to take a leadership
        role in solving the problem. Segall mentioned that an
        ITSS staff member, Pat Box, was in charge of software
        licensing and was attempting to negotiate with the
        company. Professor Noll (Economics) said he sees C-ACIS
        as having a very small net and chasing after a big
        elephant, and he questioned whether they could ever be
        particularly effective. Osgood stressed the role of
        C-ACIS in oversight and as a faculty sounding board, and
        others mentioned specific policies and actions in the
        past few years that had resulted from the committee's
        work. Professor Tatum (Civil and Environmental
        Engineering) expressed the view of several faculty
        members that information infrastructure has become
        &quot;as important as clean air and clean water&quot; and
        urged C-ACIS to advocate for current investments to
        ensure long-term infrastructure adequacy. It was agreed,
        at the suggestion of Professor Roth (Mechanical
        Engineering), that the annual report should be corrected
        to spell out all acronyms. The Academic Secretary
        accepted the 1999/2000 Annual Report of the Committee on
        Academic Computing and Information Systems on behalf of
        the Senate, and thanked the committee for its work. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Report on Staff
        Retention and Recruitment (SenD#5158) </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Chair Osgood introduced
        John Cammidge, Executive Director of Human Resources, to
        report on staff retention and recruitment issues, a topic
        of real interest to many faculty members. Cammidge, at
        Stanford for eight months, advised that he wanted to
        present and explain a good deal of data, provided to
        Senate members in advance, and to invite all members of
        the faculty to take an increased involvement in the
        well-being of staff. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Summarizing data
        concerning staff turnover at Stanford, Cammidge advised
        that Stanford's &quot;separation rate&quot; (primarily
        voluntary departures, but also including layoff,
        dismissal, retirement and death) is now 25.5% per year,
        up from 10.6% in 1996. The Stanford rate mirrors that in
        Silicon Valley, he said, but the national average is only
        12-14%. Concerning total compensation competitiveness,
        according to Cammidge, Stanford benefits are very
        competitive, base compensation is generally competitive
        at the middle of the Bay Area marketplace, and incentive
        compensation is less competitive. He advised that the
        highest separation rates are occurring in the academic
        areas, and said that a consultant had quantified the cost
        of turnover at up to $68 million annually. The causes of
        Stanford turnover, he said, include the Silicon Valley
        labor market, income pressures (cost of living, housing,
        better paid opportunities), lack of career progression,
        and issues with supervision and recognition. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Continuing to summarize
        key information, Cammidge pointed out that even though
        the number of staff vacancies had doubled since 1996,
        Stanford had continued to operate with a decentralized
        recruitment process. He also noted that existing
        supportive programs are not always used, for example
        incentive pay, flexible scheduling, access to recreation,
        quality of work life, and transportation opportunities.
        Support is not consistent across the university for
        performance management and career development, he said.
        He also emphasized that Stanford turnover is influenced
        by bureaucratic, inefficient work processes, poorly
        designed or boring jobs, and job complexity without
        adequate training. The bottom line, according to Cammidge
        -- &quot;Our Silicon Valley environment is a challenge.
        Nevertheless, we can do more to retain and recruit the
        staff employees who support Stanford's teaching and
        research activities.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Cammidge presented pie
        charts showing a total of 13,600 Stanford employees,
        including hourly and temporary workers (but excluding the
        Hospitals). Of that number, 6,200 are in ongoing staff
        positions (excluding SLAC, for which he did not have data
        but for which he said the recruitment and retention
        problems were very similar). He showed separation rates
        for Stanford's 15 schools and administrative units,
        speculating that the highest separation rates were in the
        academic areas &quot;not because of the faculty,&quot;
        but because the percentage of lower level, primarily
        administrative staff positions is higher there. Cammidge
        said that Stanford's internal movement rate of only 7%
        should be much higher -- people advancing and building
        careers at the university -- and that everyone would of
        course like to have significantly fewer than 25% leaving
        Stanford. Data also show that the lower the salary, the
        higher the turnover, he noted, reflecting cost of living
        pressures. Cammidge expressed concern that employees with
        three to five years of university service have the
        highest separation rates (34%) and attributed this in
        part to pay compression. Stanford may pay too many people
        close to the average without differentiating enough, he
        suggested. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Discussing staff base
        salary competitiveness within the Bay Area job market,
        Cammidge said that Stanford's overall position was 1.1%
        above market, and showed a slide with seven job families
        above market, one by almost 10%, and three job families
        below market. The specific job categories were not
        labeled due to confidentiality issues concerning the
        sources, Cammidge said. In response to questions from
        Education Dean Stipek and Professor Satz (Philosophy), he
        indicated that higher separation rates were not
        necessarily correlated with below market salary rates,
        and reiterated his concern that relatively uniform salary
        administration was causing Stanford to lose its best
        people. Cammidge presented data on the number of open
        positions -- 638 in August 2000, almost double the number
        four years earlier -- and indicated that &quot;there are
        more job vacancies, it is taking longer to fill them,
        there are fewer candidates, and in some cases it is
        difficult to find qualified candidates.&quot; He also
        showed a slide listing the factors cited by about 350
        people in a Fall 1999 survey asking why they joined
        Stanford, stayed at Stanford, and left Stanford. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Moving beyond the data
        to ask &quot;What lies ahead?&quot; Cammidge described a
        strategic vision of Stanford as an &quot;employer of
        choice&quot; for staff. &quot;Anything that touches on
        the staff employee relationship ought to be of concern to
        Human Resources,&quot; he stated. Assuming that all of
        the basic personnel functions must be well executed, he
        identified areas in which Stanford might strive to
        differentiate itself externally -- quality of the work
        environment, learning opportunities, housing assistance
        opportunities, and work/life cycle programs -- as well as
        areas of internal differentiation -- career
        opportunities/talent management/meaningful work,
        competitive total compensation, management and
        supervisory leadership (including faculty), and the
        Stanford community/diversity. Looking ahead 12 to 18
        months, Cammidge expressed optimism about institutional
        sponsorship to support a series of prioritized projects
        involving Human Resources and user representatives as
        well as improved HR systems and support, all geared
        toward &quot;getting the right staff, treating them well,
        and keeping them.&quot; He mentioned several items from a
        list of priority projects with sponsorship, including a
        review of staff housing needs and possible solutions
        (looking at the Stanford West apartments, and perhaps a
        403(b) loan product); a new employee referral program
        patterned after very successful Silicon Valley programs;
        and an ongoing study of childcare affordability
        scholarships. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Cammidge discussed
        several additional items from a list of potential
        priority projects. He asked for faculty feedback about
        the feasibility of increasing meaningful work by
        reviewing work processes, job design, delegated
        authorities, and organizational structures within schools
        and departments. He also suggested that the
        decentralization of the employment function in the early
        1990s should be revisited, in order to develop a Stanford
        &quot;employment brand&quot; and to provide central
        recruitment support for hard to fill jobs. Finally, he
        asked whether the faculty wanted to be involved in the
        solutions. For example, he wondered if the Faculty Staff
        Benefits Committee should be broadened to include all
        human resources issues. &quot;The basic message for me is
        really an invitation to you to become a 'stakeholder' in
        the well-being of Stanford's 6,500 staff members,&quot;
        Cammidge concluded. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Professor Zoback
        (Geophysics) suggested that reconsideration of the recent
        reduction in the child tuition grant benefit, which he
        thought had saved the university one or two million
        dollars per year, might make a significant dent in the
        25% rate and the $68 million cost of turnover. Cammidge
        agreed that education and training benefits in general
        should be evaluated, including that item as well as the
        new and underutilized program to reimburse staff members
        themselves for college tuition. Any such programs that
        can be designed to benefit employees directly, before
        taxes, are very valuable, he said. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Professor Noll
        (Economics) commented that he did not believe that
        changes in Stanford salaries and benefits over the past
        ten years were anywhere near as important as two other
        major changes: increased administrative accountability
        (due to the indirect cost controversy) and
        computerization. &quot;There is infinitely greater
        accountability for everything you do, which means there's
        a lot more work to do. And, secondly, computerization has
        been used as a mechanism to decentralize the cost of
        undertaking that activity from the central administration
        to the academic and research units. The proportion of the
        work that's done locally has been increased with no
        change in classification level and no change in the
        number of staff. As a result, the amount of time has gone
        way up that department administrative staff spend proving
        they're not criminals or satisfying some distant person
        that they never can talk to because they only have voice
        mail. And if you just talk to these people, they'll tell
        you that's why they don't like their jobs.&quot; The
        faculty in departments also feels these things, e.g.,
        trying to get reimbursed for travel or to spend their
        grant money, Noll said, but they have no real way to
        judge how much of the increasing complexity is absolutely
        required, or how much might have been overreacting to
        external circumstances. H &amp; S Dean Beasley said that
        he agreed to some extent but also felt that the faculty
        could play a significant role in reexamining the
        administrative structures in their own departments and
        schools. Professor Wooley (Electrical Engineering) agreed
        with Noll that staff had a particularly miserable job
        arranging for travel and reimbursement. President
        Hennessy cautioned that the faculty often do not read the
        rules and the difficult task of telling them &quot;You
        can't do this,&quot; falls to the staff. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Professor Tatum (Civil
        and Environmental Engineering) commented that rules
        concerning equity with existing employees were one of the
        most difficult challenges in hiring new people.
        Responding to Wooley, Cammidge indicated that the data
        presented to Senate was public and could be shared with
        department staff. He said that he would be delighted to
        come to departments to discuss the issues, and Senate
        Chair Osgood encouraged him to do so. Osgood thanked
        Cammidge for a thoughtful presentation. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Obtaining a motion and a
        second, Osgood declared the Senate meeting adjourned at
