Introduction</a></h2><p>	GaN is a strongly bonded compound well suited for applications such as highpower, high temperature electronics. The bonding energy of GaN is 8.9 eV/atomwhereas for GaAs it is only 6.5 eV/atom  <a name="ref1" href="#1">[1]</a>. Consequently, the free energy G(T)of the crystal is very low in relation to the reference state of free N and Gaatoms.	On the other hand, the N<sub>2</sub> molecule is also strongly bonded(4.9eV/atom). Therefore, the free energy of the constituent Ga andN<sub>2</sub> becomes quite close and surpasses that of GaN as the temperatureis raised. <a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a> shows the free energy of GaN (1 mole) versus itsconstituents (Ga + 1/2N<sub>2</sub>) as a function of temperature.	<p>The G(T) of the constituents decreases faster than that of the GaN crystal andat higher temperatures GaN become thermodynamically unstable.	The crossing of G(T) curves determines the equilibrium temperature where GaNcoexists with its constituents at a given N<sub>2 </sub>pressure.	The application of pressure allows  us to increase the free energy of theconstituents much more than that of the crystal shifting the equilibrium pointto higher temperature and extending the stability range of GaN.	The equilibrium p<sub>N2</sub> - T conditions for GaN determinedexperimentally by Karpinski <i>et al.</i>  <a name="ref2" href="#karpinski-jcg-66-1">[2]</a>  <a name="ref3" href="#karpinski-jcg-66-11">[3]</a> are shown in <a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>.<p>	Most of crystallization processes discussed in this paper have beencarried-out in large volume gas pressure reactors at an N<sub>2</sub>overpressure of up to 15 kbar, which corresponds to a GaN stability limit at1850K.	The maximum temperature of 1850 K is quite far from the melting temperature ofGaN. According to the theoretical estimation of Van Vechten  <a name="ref4" href="#vechten-prb-7-1479">[4]</a> the meltingpoint of GaN is ~3000K. The N<sub>2</sub> equilibrium pressure at the meltingpoint is therefore much higher than we can obtain in our experimental system.	The extension of the GaN stability range to 1850 K allows the growth of GaNcrystals from a liquid Ga solution. In <a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a> we show the N solubility dataresulting from the annealing of Ga at the three phase equilibrium conditions of<a href="#figure2">Figure 2</a>.<p>Since the N concentrations are not high, the growth experiments have to be longto obtain high quality bulk GaN crystals with dimensions appropriate formeasurements and applications. Therefore, stability over a long time (&gt;100h)is an additional requirement for the growth system.	The solid line in <a href="#figure3">Figure 3</a> is the liquidus line for Ga-GaN system calculatedusing an ideal solution approximation and Van Vechten's meltingtemperature of 2790K. For an ideal solution, the solubility can be expressedas:<p><br><table width="100%"><tr><td align=center><img width=118 height=32 src="numberedequation1.gif"></td><td align=right><a name="numberedequation1">(1)</a></td></tr></table><br><p>where H<sub>sol</sub> is the heat of dissolution. For GaN, H<sub>sol </sub>=44.7 kcal/mole = 0.49 eV/bond and expresses the bonding energy in the crystalin relation to its mother phase: the solution.<p><h2><a name="section2">2. Crystal Growth</a></h2><h3><a name="section2.1">2.1. Experimental</a></h3>	The growth system is designed for the crystallization of GaN from solutionunder high N<sub>2</sub> overpressure at high temperature in relatively largevolumes. Since the material to be grown is a semiconductor for optoelectronicapplications, the system has to fullfil all the requirements concerning purityand control of the growth conditions. Moreover, crystallization from a dilutesolution requires lengthy processes of ~100 hours. Therefore, the high pressure- high temperature crystallization reactor (chamber and multizone furnace) hasto be supplied with additional systems necessary for:<ol><li>	<i> in situ </i>annealing in vacuum<li>	electronic stabilization and programming of pressure<li>	electronic stabilization and programming of temperature<li>	pressure, temperature, voltage and current sensitive alarms<li>	cooling of the pressure chamber</ol>	In <a href="#figure4">Figure 4</a> we have shown schematically such an experimental apparatus. Manyfunctions mentioned above are realized by the use of standard commerciallyavailable devices ( e.g. vacuum pumps, temperature programmers, mass flowdetectors...). The pressure in the chamber is stabilized with a precisionbetter than 20 bar. The temperature is measured by a set of thermocouplesarranged along the furnace and coupled with the standard input power controlelectronic system. This allows the stabilization of temperature better than 0.5deg., and the ability to program changes in the furnace temperaturedistribution during the experiment.<p>	Supersaturation in the growth solution has been created by the application oftemperature gradients along the axis of the crucible. Both horizontal andvertical arrangements of the crucibles have been used. The typical duration ofthe experiments was 100 - 150 hours for crystals of 6-10 mm in size.<p><p><p><p><h3><a name="section2.2">2.2. Crystallization without intentional seeding</a></h3><p>	Gallium, when heated under high N<sub>2</sub> pressure, does not wet thecrucible walls (usually graphite or BN). Rather, it is covered with a thin GaNlayer consisting of GaN single crystals. This is the first step of GaNcrystallization at high N<sub>2 </sub>pressure. The size of the crystalscovering the Ga depends on the sequence and rates of compression and heating ofthe system. A typical structure of the surface layer is shown in <a href="#figure5">Figure 5</a>.<p><p>	The formation of the surface layer inhibits further synthesis of the nitridewhich allows longtime crystallization processes and the growth of relativelylarge GaN crystals. Since the solution is in a temperature gradient, the GaNlayer at the hot end of the crucible dissolves in gallium and is transported,by convection and diffusion, to the cooler zone of the crucible where thesolution become supersaturated and crystallization of GaN takes place. Thecrystals of the surface layer are the natural source of growth centers forfurther crystallization. Some of them start to grow faster hindering the growthof the neighboring ones. This selection leads to the formation of relativelylarge, well shaped GaN crystals on the internal surface of the surface layer.<p>	The GaN crystals grown by this method are wurzite, mainly in the form ofhexagonal platelets or hexagonal needles, depending on the growth conditions. Ageneral tendency is that high supersaturation favors growth in the c-directionwhich produces the needle-like crystals. Supersaturation of the growth solutionis determined mainly by the growth temperature, supercooling, mass transportmechanisms in Ga, and also the local surroundings for a particular crystal.<p>	Crystals in the form of hexagonal platelets grow slowly, with a rate &lt;0.1mm/h into the {10<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="16" ALT="(-1)" SRC="/gifs/onebar.GIF">0} directions (perpendicular to the c-axis). They areusually single crystals having perfect morphology suggesting stable layer-bylayer growth. They are transparent, colorless, with flat faces. In some cases,three dimensional, hexagonal growth which occurs during the post-growth systemcooling is observed on the crystal surfaces. Some GaN platelets grown withoutintentional seeding are shown in <a href="#figure6">Figure 6</a>.<p>	For crystallization of large GaN crystals by this method, it is crucial tocontrol the supersaturation to avoid acceleration of the growth near the edgesand corners of the growing crystal. This can occur if some of them reachdimensions significantly larger than the others. Then the edge nucleation onthe hexagonal faces of the GaN platelets is often observed. This is the firststep to unstable growth on these faces. The result of such a growth is shown in<a href="#figure7a">Figure 7a</a>. In extreme cases of very high supersaturation or when thesupersaturation is abruptly increased (i.e. by increasing the temperaturegradient), the growth into c-direction, nucleated at the edges of the platelet,become very fast and leads to the formation of well developed {10<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="16" ALT="(-1)" SRC="/gifs/onebar.GIF">0}faces. This results in a hollow needle-like crystal such as is shown in Figure7b. Therefore, for growing of large GaN platelets of stable morphology, thesupersaturation must be decreased during the crystallization process inorder toprevent the runaway phenomena just described.<p>Therefore for the stable growth of large GaN crystals it is necessary to havesufficiently low and uniform supersaturation across the growing crystal faces.One of the most important factors influencing the uniformity of N-concentrationin the growth zone is the volume of the solution in relation to the size of thegrowing crystal. In <a href="#figure8">Figure 8</a> we show a crystal grown in a crucible with aninternal diameter of 17 mm (as opposed to 14 mm previously). The increase inthe crucible volume resulted in a significant increase of the size of crystalswhich could be grown with stable morphology.<p>	We summarize the general tendencies of GaN crystal growth without anintentional seeding following from the experimental results:<ol><li>	The growth of GaN crystals from a diluted solution in liquid gallium isstrongly anisotropic.<li>	At lower supersaturations, the fastest growth directions are the [1 0<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="16" ALT="(-1)" SRC="/gifs/onebar.GIF"> 0 ] ones, perpendicular to the c-axis of the crystal. The growth ratein the [ 0 0 0 1 ] directions, parallel to the c-axis is then extremely slow.This results in thin hexagonal platelets.<li>	With increasing supersaturation, the rate of the growth parallel to thec-axis abruptly increases, resulting in needle like crystals with welldeveloped {10<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="16" ALT="(-1)" SRC="/gifs/onebar.GIF">0} faces.</ol>	We have estimated the supersaturation at which high quality GaN platelet growat a rate of 0.1 mm/h. in the [1 0 <IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="16" ALT="(-1)" SRC="/gifs/onebar.GIF"> 0] direction (see <a href="#figure9">Figure 9</a>). Forthe estimation, we assumed two dimensional layer-by-layer growth on the{10<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="16" ALT="(-1)" SRC="/gifs/onebar.GIF">0} face of the platelet with a thickness of 0.1 mm and length ofthe leading edge of 1 mm. We also assumed that the creation of a 2-D criticalnucleus on the crystal face results in the growth of a new layer. That is, thelateral growth rate is fast enough to complete the plane before appearance ofthe next nucleus of the critical size. A heat of GaN dissolution in liquid Gaof 0.49eV/bond (see Introduction) was used as a measure of bond energy in thecrystal in relation to the liquid phase.<p>For a crystal growing at 1800K, we have obtained a supersaturation of the orderof 50%. For the growth of GaN on a seed crystal with well developed{10<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="16" ALT="(-1)" SRC="/gifs/onebar.GIF">0} faces, the supersaturation necessary for stable two dimensionalgrowth can be significantly lower due to large surface area of the fast growingplanes. The details of this estimation will be published elsewhere  <a name="ref5" href="#5">[5]</a>.<p><h3><a name="section2.3">2.3. Seeding</a></h3>	Knowing that GaN in our experimental conditions prefers to grow in a stableway in directions perpendicular to the c-axis, we decided to use a needle likecrystal to seed the growth on the {10<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="16" ALT="(-1)" SRC="/gifs/onebar.GIF">0} faces. In <a href="#figure10">Figure 10</a>, we showthe seed crystal which was introduced into the cooler zone of the verticalcrucible. It had well developed {10<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="16" ALT="(-1)" SRC="/gifs/onebar.GIF">0} prismatic faces and also{10<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="16" ALT="(-1)" SRC="/gifs/onebar.GIF">1} pyramidal ones. A hexagonal surface did not appear due to thefast growth of the needle in c-direction.<p>Prior to the growth, it was necessary to heat the system up to1200<sup>o</sup>C at low N<sub>2</sub> pressure to achieve wetting of the seedwith liquid Ga. If the sysyem were be heated at high pressure, thepolycrystalline surface layer would cover the Ga surface adjacent to the seed,and eliminate its usefulness for further crystallization.<p>	The growth on the seed was performed under conditions where high qualityplatelets were obtained in previously described processes without intentionalseeding. The resulting crystal, after 50 hours of growth, is shown in <a href="#figure11">Figure11</a>.<p><p>The fast growth directions were the [1&nbsp;0&nbsp;<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="16" ALT="(-1)" SRC="/gifs/onebar.GIF">&nbsp;0], asexpected, and also the [1&nbsp;0&nbsp;<IMG WIDTH="10" HEIGHT="16" ALT="(-1)" SRC="/gifs/onebar.GIF">&nbsp;1] one perpendicular tothe pyramidal face. Since the growth rate in the c-direction was very small, ahexagonal face developed in the resulting crystal.<p>	As we know from previous considerations, at low supersaturations, the growthrate in c-direction is almost zero whereas at higher supersaturations we fallinto the "difficult" region of the abrupt increase of the nucleation rate.Therefore, the growth on the hexagonal face is difficult to control andprobably is very sensitive to fluctuations of temperature, convectional flowsand uniformity of the nitrogen concentration field in the crystal surrounding.This can easily lead to three dimensional nucleation or to edge instabilitiesof the growth.<p><h2><a name="section3">3. Physical Properties of GaN crystals</a></h2><p>	The quality of the GaN crystals was estimated by X-ray rockingcurves<sup> </sup> <a name="ref6" href="#leszczynski-jcg-126-601">[6]</a>. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the X-rayrocking curves ((0004) CuK reflection) depends on the size of the crystal. Thevalue is 20-30 arcsec for 1mm crystals and 30-40 arcsec for 1-3 mm ones. Forlarger platelets the rocking curves split into a few 30-40 arcsec peaks showingthe presence of low angle (1-3 arcmin) boundaries separating grains of 0.5-2 mmin size. Misorientation between grains increases monotonically from end to endof the crystal  <a name="ref7" href="#leszczynski-unpublished-1">[7]</a>. This indicates a "bending" of the crystal during growth,followed by strain relaxation leading to the formation of the low angleboundaries. Indeed, the lattice constantsmeasured for the two basal planes ofthe crystals differ by 0.001 <font face="symbol">&#187;</font>, suggesting different growth mechanisms anddefect structures for the two polar directions of the GaN platelet. It wasshown by Liliental-Weber et al.  <a name="ref8" href="#lilientalweber-jem-25-1545">[8]</a> by TEM examination and confirmed by AFMstudies  <a name="ref9" href="#nowak-mijnsr-1-5">[9]</a>, that one of the polar surfaces of the GaN crystals (especially forthe smaller ones) is often atomically flat (2-3 monolayer steps present) andthe crystal below is practically free of extended defects. However a highconcentration of point defects, mainly N-vacancies and Ga-antisites, werededuced from Convergent Beam Electron Diffraction patterns  <a href="#lilientalweber-jem-25-1545">[8]</a>. On the oppositeside, regular pyramids of 100 - 200 <font face="symbol">&#187;</font> in size terminate the surface  <a href="#lilientalweber-jem-25-1545">[8]</a>  <a href="#nowak-mijnsr-1-5">[9]</a>.Below are many extended defects such as stacking faults, dislocation loops andGa micro-precipitates. Such pecularities result from the different growth modesof the two polar directions of the crystal in the Ga-rich conditions of theprocess.<p>For larger (&gt;3 mm) GaN plateletes, the presence of three dimensionalhexagonal features on the surfaces is typical. This results from the systemcooling after the growth in the temperature gradient.<p>	The GaN crystals are highly conductive, showing metallic behavior in the wholetemperature range of 4.2-300K. Free electron concentration of 10<sup>19 </sup>-10<sup>20</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup> with mobilities of 30-90 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs  <a name="ref10" href="#perlin-apl-67-2524">[10]</a>are present regardless of temperature. No clear dependence of the electricalproperties on the growth conditions has been observed. Both <i>ab initio</i>calculations of electronic structure of GaN native defects  <a name="ref11" href="#boguslawski-prb-51-17255">[11]</a>  <a name="ref12" href="#neugebauer-prb-50-8067">[12]</a> andexperiments  <a name="ref13" href="#perlin-prl-75-296">[13]</a> confirm that the source of free electrons in this GaN isN-vacancies.<p>	The optical absorption spectra of pressure-grown GaN crystals and epitaxialGaN layers with a free electron concentration of 6x10<sup>17 </sup>cm<sup>-3</sup>have been measured by Teisseyre et al.<sup> </sup> <a name="ref14" href="#teisseyre-jap-76-2429">[14]</a>. A shift to highenergy of the optical absorption edge for the bulk sample is observed andassigned to the Burstein-Moss effect  <a href="#teisseyre-jap-76-2429">[14]</a>. Due to this shift, the bulk GaNsubstrate crystals are transparent to near edge luminescence of GaN.<p>	The dominant luminescence features of GaN bulk crystals are near band edgeemission at ~3.5 eV and a broad yellow luminescence band centered around 2.3eV.<p><h2><a name="section4">4. GaN homoepitaxy</a></h2><p>	The first results of homoepitaxial growth of GaN MOCVD layers have beenrecently reported  <a name="ref15" href="#pakula-solstcomm-97-919">[15]</a>. Pressure grown GaN crystals were used as substrates.The layers were grown in a horizontal atmospheric pressure Epigress systemadapted to the growth of nitrides. TMG and NH<sub>3</sub> were used as sourcesof Ga and N, and H<sub>2</sub> was the carrier gas. The substrates did notrequire any mechanical or chemical surface treatment before the growth. Alsothe deposition of a low temperature buffer layer was omitted. The growthtemperature was 900 - 1050&#176;C. P-doping was realized using theMCp<sub>2</sub>Mg metalorganic and subsequent annealing of the layer at700&#176;C in the presence of N<sub>2</sub> gas. Si was introduced toachieve n-doping of the layers.<p>	Atomic Force Microscopy studies performed on homoepitaxially grown GaN layersindicate the presence of monatomic steps on the layer surfaces, often in theform of large diameter (100 m) spirals indicating two dimensional growth onscrew dislocations.<p>	The X-ray diffraction peaks from the homoepitaxial layer and from GaNsubstrate from  <a href="#leszczynski-unpublished-1">[7]</a> are shown in <a href="#figure12">Figure 12</a>. The lattice constant parallel to theinterface is the same for both the substrate and homolayer, whereas the cconstant of the epilayer is smaller by about 0.02%. The increase of the clattice constant of the bulk GaN crystals is related to the presence of thesame point defects responsible for the high concentration of free electrons.<p>	The high quality of the homoepitaxial layers is confirmed by thephotoluminescence measurements  <a href="#pakula-solstcomm-97-919">[15]</a>. The spectrum is dominated by two strongand narrow lines XD (3.4719 eV) and XA (3.4666 eV) related to the excitonsbound to neutral impurity centers  <a href="#pakula-solstcomm-97-919">[15]</a>. The FWHM of these lines is about1.8 meVand 1.0 meV respectively. The higher energy XD line shows a double peakstructure which fitted with Lorenzian curves can be described by energies:E<sub>1 </sub>= 3.4711 eV, E<sub>2 </sub>= 3.4720 eV. The photoluminescence andreflectivity of GaN homoepitaxial layers are analyzed in detail in  <a href="#pakula-solstcomm-97-919">[15]</a>. Alsothe lifetime of the bound excitons has been measured  <a name="ref16" href="#godlewski-bookarticle-1996-356">[16]</a> to be 650 and 700 psfor excitons bound to the neutral donor and acceptor, respectively. This ismuch higher than the corresponding values for GaN/sapphire (70 and 140 ps,respectively).<p>	The PL spectra for p-type Mg doped GaN homoepitaxial layers have been reported <a name="ref17" href="#wysmolek-bookarticle-1996-492">[17]</a>. In addition to the XD and XA exciton lines (XA line much stronger thanfor undoped layers), a series of very narrow lines attributed to donor-acceptorpair related transitions have been observed between 3.4 - 3.5 eV. The FWHM ofthese lines were &lt; 0.5 meV. The PL lines observed for MOCVD grownhomoepitaxial layers are the narrowest so far reported for GaN.<p>	Recently very high quality homoepitaxial layer have been obtained by MBE  <a name="ref18" href="#teisseyre-mijnsr-1-13">[18]</a>.The nearedge photoluminescence spectrum of this layer is dominated by XD and XApeaks and 3 lines corresponding to free excitons. The PL lines for this layerare even sharper than for best MOCVD samples. The halfwidth of the XA line issmaller than 0.5 meV<p><h2><a name="section5">5. Conclusions</a></h2><p>	High quality GaN crystals can be grown at nitrogen pressure up to 15kbar. The main obstacle to growing larger substrate sized GaN crystals isinstability of the growth. The instability is related to the non-uniformdistribution of nitrogen in the solution due to the small volume of thecrucible in relation to the size of growing GaN crystals.<p>	It is shown that high quality homoepitaxial layers can be obtained on the "asgrown", single crystalline, pressure grown GaN substrates. Further optimizationof both substrate and homoepitaxial growth techniques should lead to thefabrication of efficient optoelectronic devices. Special effort has to be paidto increasing of the size of high quality GaN substrates.<p><p><h2><a name="index9">Acknowledgments</a></h2><b>	The research reported in this work has been supported by the Polish Committee for ScientificResearch grant # 7 7834 95 C/2399.</b><p><!--tail--><h2>References</h2><p class="bibitem"><a name="1">[1]</a>W.
