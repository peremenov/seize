Howdy! ,<br>
I'm Lame Little Johnny, a ten week old precious male kitten, who desperately needs a helping paw! When I was younger, my front left leg was badly injured. I was shunned by my mom and siblings and was left to fend for myself. I dragged myself around for several weeks, starving, weak, and full of fleas and worms! Finally, a nice gentleman found me and called Delaware Valley Veterinary Hospital, who told him to call Shirl of Stubbs Animal Rescue, also a client of Del Val. I was examined by Dr. John Vinciguerra. He told my rescue mom that my leg had to be amputated! However, before I can be operated on, I must put on some weight and get stronger. Dr. Steve Milden and Dr. John Vinciguerra of Delaware Valley Veterinary Hospital will be doing my surgery. My rescue mom says they are the BEST and that they will take great care of me! <br>After I heal, I will need a very special loving home. <br>
Thank you and please say a prayer for me.<br>
Love,<br>
Little Johnny<br>
PS<br><br>

UPDATE!!!!!!! LITTLE JOHNNY IS RECOVERING NICELY FROM HIS SURGERY. HE IS RUNNING AND PLAYING ON HIS THREE GOOD LEGS. LITTLE JOHNNY SENDS HIS LOVE TO ALL THE CARING PEOPLE WHO HELPED HIM THROUGH HIS ORDEAL. 
<br><br>

UPDATE!!!!!!! LITTLE JOHNNY HAS BEEN ADOPTED BY HIS FOSTER PARENTS WHO COULD NOT BEAR TO PART WITH HIM.  HE IS NOW ENJOYING LIFE IN HIS PERMANENT FOREVER HOME.  MANY THANKS TO THIS WONDERFUL MOTHER AND DAUGHTER DUO FOR ALL THEY HAVE DONE ON BEHALF OF HOMELESS ANIMALS.  <br><br>

"I ask for the privilege of not being born ... not to be born until you can assure me of a home and a master to protect me, and a right to live as long as I am physically able to enjoy life ... not to be born until my body is precious and men have ceased to exploit it because it is cheap and plentiful."  Need we say more?  Pet overpopulation is a monumental problem.  Spay/Neuter is the solution.  <P><P>

I wanted to thank you for helping us last week in a mass trapping event that was magnificent.  It involved a colony located right in the midst of the Wharton State Forest, managed by a fellow living in one of those grandfathered houses and surrounded by state forest.  This was as colony that was cause for consternation...  Thanks for your help in this most remarkable day.....  Thanks again for your very great help in this very good story with a most happy ending.
  </L6><P>

Preparation for the next project to spay/neuter 90+ cats is underway.  Will keep you posted. <P></LEFT></OL>
