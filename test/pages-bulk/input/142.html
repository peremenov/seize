<p>
In this passage, taken from his 1776 book
"An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations"
Adam Smith set out the mechanism by which he felt economic society
operated. Each individual strives to become wealthy "intending
only his own gain" but to this end he must exchange what he
owns or produces with others who sufficiently value what he has
to offer; in this way, by division of labour and a free market,
public interest is advanced.
<p>
Smith is often regarded as the father of economics, and his writings
have been enormously influential. Nowadays, "invisible hand" explanations
are invoked to explain all sorts of phenomena, from scientific progress
to environmental degradation. In the modern context, mathematicians
study "invisible hand" processes as part of Game Theory, the branch of
mathematics that deals with payoffs and strategies (see
<a href="../../../issue13/features/brams/index.html">Game
Theory and the Cuban Missile Crisis</a>)
in Issue 13 of <i>Plus</i>.
<p>
Smith was profoundly religious, and saw the
"invisible hand" as the mechanism by which a benevolent God
administered a universe in which human happiness was
maximised. He made it clear in his writings that quite
considerable structure was required in society before the 
invisible hand mechanism could work efficiently. For example,
property rights must be strong, and there must be widespread
adherence to moral norms, such as prohibitions against theft and
misrepresentation. Theft was, to Smith, the worst crime of all,
even though a poor man stealing from a rich man may increase
overall happiness.
He even went so far as to say that the purpose of government
is to defend the rich from the poor.
<p>
Here is a description of the way Smith imagined the universe operates:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
There is a benevolent deity who administers the world in such
a way as to maximise human happiness.
<li>
In order to do this he has created humans with a nature
that leads them to act in a certain way.
<li>
The world as we know it is pretty much perfect, and everyone is 
about equally happy. In particular, the rich are no happier than the poor.
<li>
Although this means we should all be happy with our lot in life,
our nature (which, remember, was created by God for the purpose
of maximising happiness) leads us to think that we would be
happier if we were wealthier.
<li>
This is a good thing, because it leads us to struggle to become 
wealthier, thus increasing the sum total of human happiness via
the mechanisms of exchange and division of labour.
</ul>
<p>
It is clear why Smith says that moral norms are necessary for such
a system to work - in order for exchange to proceed, 
contracts must be enforceable, people must have good
access to information about the products and services
available, and the rule of law must hold. 
<p>
<h2>The modern "Invisible Hand"</h2>
<p>
Nowadays, something much more general is meant by the expression
"invisible hand". An invisible hand process is one in which
the outcome to be explained is produced in a decentralised way,
with no explicit agreements between the
acting agents. The second essential
component is that the process is not intentional. The agents' aims
are not coordinated nor identical with the actual outcome, which is
a byproduct of those aims. The process should work even
without the agents having any knowledge of it. This is why the process
is called invisible.
<p>
The system in which the invisible hand is most often assumed
to work is the free market. 
Adam Smith assumed that consumers choose for the lowest price,
and that entrepreneurs choose for the highest rate of profit.
He asserted that by thus making their excess or insufficient demand known through
market prices, consumers "directed" entrepreneurs' investment money to
the most profitable industry. Remember that this is the industry 
producing the goods most highly
valued by consumers, so in general economic well-being is increased.
<p>
One extremely positive aspect of a market-based
economy is that it forces people to think about what
other people want. Smith saw this as a large part of
what was good about the invisible hand mechanism.
He identified two ways to obtain
the help and co-operation of other people, upon which we all depend constantly.
The first way is to appeal to the benevolence and goodwill of others. 
To do this a person must often act in a servile and fawning way, which Smith
found repulsive, and he claimed it generally meets
with very limited success. The second way is to
appeal instead to other people's self-interest. In one of his most famous quotes:
<blockquote>
<i>
Man has almost constant occasion for the help of his
brethren, and it is in vain for him to expect it from their
benevolence only. He will be more likely to prevail if he can
interest their self-love in his favour, and show them that it is for
their own advantage to do for him what he requires of them.
Whoever offers to another a bargain of any kind, proposes to do
this. Give me what I want, and you shall have this which you want, is
the meaning of every such offer; and it is the manner that we
obtain from one another the far greater part of those good offices which
we stand in need of. It is not from the benevolence of the
butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from
their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not
to their humanity but to their self-love.
</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
For Smith, to propose an exchange is to attempt to show another that what
you can do, or what you have, can be of use to the other. When you carry
out the exchange, it means the other person
recognises that what you can do or that what you
have is of value. This is why so much of a person's self-esteem is bound up
in their job - a well-paid job is supposed to be a sign that others value your
contribution and find it worth exchanging their own resources for.
<p>

<p>
The theory of the invisible hand is certainly persuasive, and its simplicity
is also very attractive. No doubt every reader can see that it describes
the way that things really work on many occasions, and, whether we 
find it palatable or not, we probably all recognise the truth of Smith's assertion that 
paying for your dinner is a more reliable way to get it than
appealing to the benevolence of others.
<p>
But, even assuming all the correct conditions, does the invisible hand theory
really lead to the maximisation of human economic wellbeing
in some sense, as Smith asserts?
This is where mathematics, in the form of Game Theory, can provide us with
some insights.
<P>
<h3>The Prisoner's Dilemma</h3>
<p>
The "Prisoner's Dilemma" is a very famous "paradox" in Game Theory.
It describes two people in a simple situation, acting in an informed manner,
both attempting to maximise
their wellbeing, and yet making choices that lead to an 
unnecessarily poor outcome for both. 
<p>
Two people, who are suspected of being accomplices in a crime, 
are held prisoner in separate, non-communicating cells.
The police visit each prisoner, and tell both that  
if neither confesses, each will be sentenced to two years in jail.
However, if exactly one prisoner confesses, implicating each other, the one
who confesses will get off scot-free as a reward, and the other, who didn't 
confess, will receive a punitive sentence of five years. 
If each confesses and implicates the other, both will be 
sentenced to three years.
<p>
What should a prisoner in this situation do? 
Suppose that the other prisoner doesn't
confess. Then the best course of action is to confess, 
and go free. Even if the other prisoner
does confess, it will be better to have done likewise - 
at least the sentence will be lower.
Both prisoners will reason thus, so both will confess and
end up serving sentences of three years - even
though, if both had remained silent, both would have served 
sentences of only two years.
<p>
It may not be immediately clear what the relevance of the Prisoner's Dilemma
is to Smith's theory of the Invisible Hand. In fact, it has a number of
implications for economic behaviour.

The Prisoner's Dilemma
</p>

<p>
<h4>The temptation to default</h4>
<p>
We can think of the prisoners as being asked to decide
whether to keep a contract they have made with each other
(remain silent) or to default (confess and betray the other). 
Similar choices have to be made all the time in economic society.
When two people freely agree to exchange 
goods or services to their mutual benefit, each must
decide whether to try to cheat the other by defaulting, or handing 
over counterfeit goods,
or whether to act in good faith and risk the
other party defaulting. Obviously, both parties 
are better off if neither default
than if both default - after all, we suppose they 
willingly contracted with each
other - but each would like to get
something for nothing, and each is
afraid the other will feel the same. The result may well be
that the parties are unable to carry out the exchange
as arranged, and both lose out.
<p>
The reason we don't see this behaviour too often is because we live in a 
society where courts can enforce contracts. This reduces the fear of 
the other party defaulting, and makes it easier to hand over goods
ahead of receiving whatever is to be exchanged for them.
In illegal exchanges, for example,
receiving stolen goods, default is more common, and rather difficult 
for criminals to guard against.
<p>
Enforcing laws of contract requires cooperation and resources from someone 
else - in democratic societies, the
courts on behalf of the government and the people. 
But courts and prisons and police 
cost money and most
of the costs fall on people who were not party 
to the contract in the first place -
who are therefore paying for a service that doesn't 
directly benefit themselves.
Such courts fall into the category of "public good" - 
we are all better off in a society
where the rule of law is upheld - but are not created and maintained 
by any invisible hand mechanism.
Courts are set up deliberately to carry out a public good; 
and, although they may not always work
the way they are intended to, there is nothing 
unintended about their use to enforce
contracts.
<p>
<h4>Subsidy-seeking</h4>
<p>
In a democratic society, there is a strong temptation
for "special-interest" groups to form and lobby the 
government to provide tax-payers'
money to the group in the form of subsidies. 
Politicians find the prospect of buying the loyalty of the
group attractive, and the group sees the prospect
of getting other people's money for nothing. 
Clearly, everyone
would be better off if no one sought subsidies - by definition,
subsidies are only needed for unprofitable activities, that is,
activities that other people do not value sufficiently
to pay their own money for. However,
if other people seek and gain subsidies, anyone who doesn't
bother trying to do the same for themselves
will end up subsidising others while receiving no subsidies
themselves. This fear may force large numbers of people
to spend their time lobbying the government 
for subsidies, rather than
simply engaging in more profitable activities - a classic example
of the
Prisoner's Dilemma, and one over which no court has jurisdiction.
<p>
A very similar situation occurs regarding monopolies.
Since pretty much every producer is a consumer, it is probably to 
everybody's benefit overall if no producers attempt to raise prices by 
monopolising their market; however, attempting to enforce a monopoly can be very
attractive to individual producers. Smith rather sardonically observed that 
<blockquote>
<i>
"People of the same trade 
seldom meet together even for merriment and diversion, 
but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public or some
contrivance to raise prices."
</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
<h3>Arrow's Theorem</h3>
<p>
As explained in the
<a href="../../../issue13/editorial/index.html#voting">Editorial</a>
of Issue 13 of <i>Plus</i>, Arrow's Impossibility Theorem says that,
in a certain sense, 
it is impossible to produce a consistent group preference
by aggregating individual preferences.
It is normally stated in terms of votes and elections,
and, in this format, says that is impossible to use information about individual
voters' preferences to decide what is "the will of the people".
Every voting system in current use throws up anomalies, such
as "flip-flops", which occur when a third candidate enters the race and overturns
the group preference between the other two candidates (think of
Ralph Nader in California, splitting Al Gore's vote and handing George
Bush the election).
<p>
<h4>The "will of the people"</h4>
<p>
Again, the relevance to allocation of public goods is not immediately
obvious - until you recall that an essential part of the invisible
hand process is that producers respond to an single signal that is 
meant to be an aggregate of all signals
by consumers. Arrow's Theorem is often interpreted as
saying that there is no consistent
way to aggregate the preferences of individuals to give a single
preference which can be regarded as the preference of society -
or "the will of the people".
<p>
An economic version of the flip-flop could occur if a majority
of customers would prefer to buy Product X to Product Y,
but some of that majority actually
like Product Z even better (the equivalent of splitting the vote); 
the producer may end up producing
Product Y even though more people would have liked Product X,
and presumably it would have been more profitable to produce it.
If this happens, then the invisible hand cannot be said to have 
worked to maximise economic wellbeing.

<p>
<h2>How far does the invisible hand reach?</h2>
<p>
How economic systems work and what can be done to improve them
is still very much a live area of research for economists.
Mathematicians are currently grappling with the implications of game 
theory for all sorts of social choice, in particular, what meaning, if any,
can be attached to the expressions "the will of the people" and
"the public good".
<p>
The results of such analyses will not be the only factor
in deciding whether societies move towards or away
from laissez-faire economics ("laissez-faire" means
"let alone" and is shorthand for leaving things to the
invisible hand).
Political will, whether the world becomes more peaceful or less,
and the practicality of any alternatives will also be factors.
Alternative systems tend to require
much more intervention and more stringent rules. 
In the real world, such rules 
automatically introduce more and more opportunities for
mistakes and corruption, which might mean that another system,
even if better in principle, would be worse in practice.
<p>
Perhaps the strongest reason for leaving the allocation
of effort and reward to the invisible hand is that
when it misappropriates
goods, it is likely to be
on a small scale. More centralised methods of allocating
goods are more prone to corruption and waste. Smith described
people given the spending of other people's money thus:
<blockquote>
<i>
..being the managers of other people's money
than of their own, it cannot well be expected
that they should watch over it with the same
anxious vigilance with which partners in a
private copartnery frequently watch over their
own. Like the stewards of a rich man, they
... consider attention to small matters as
not for their master's honour and very easily
give themselves a dispensation from having it.
</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is useful to remember the context in which
Smith developed his theories - that of a heavily planned and rather
dictatorial society, where some individuals were above the law
and others were effectively without any rights. In a centralised society
a few individuals make decisions on how to spend everyone's money
and direct everyone's effort. As Smith said
<blockquote>
<i>
It is the highest impertinence and presumption, therefore,
in kings and ministers to pretend to watch over the economy of private
people, and to restrain their expense...They are themselves always, and
without exception, the greatest spendthrifts in the society.
</i>
