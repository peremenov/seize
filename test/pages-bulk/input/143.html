OUTREACH GENERAL OVERVIEW&nbsp; 2006-2007:</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
This is our 15th year doing outreach around the State of Oregon and
occasionally
into Washington and California.&nbsp; We visit approximately 300
classrooms
each school year, fairly evenly distributed in grade levels.<br>
          <br>
          <b>LOGISTICS OF OUTREACH SESSIONS: (contents in next section)<br>
          </b><br>
General Info:&nbsp; I'm (Rick Kang) probably the person that will come
to
your classroom.&nbsp; The program is a collaborative extension of
University
of Oregon's Professor Greg Bothun's "Electronic Universe" project (see <a
 href="http://zebu.uoregon.edu">http://zebu.uoregon.edu</a>).<br>
We may have other outreach instructors available during the year,
particularly
in the Portland and Central Oregon areas.&nbsp; We create specific
sessions
for each class, grade appropriate, and addressing specific topics you
want
covered.<br>
The program fits into many areas of science curriculum FOR ALL GRADE
LEVELS
INCLUDING EARLY ELEMENTARY.&nbsp; Content tie-ins can be forces,
motion,
cycles, electricity, matter and energy, radiation/waves, general
physical
science, and some areas of geology, meteorology, and ecology.&nbsp;
Within
a specific Earth Science/Astronomy program, the Electronic Universe can
serve
well as an introduction to how we probe deep space as well as answering
students'
questions later on and providing a capstone conclusional activity such
as
one of our digital labs (see below for details).<br>
          <br>
The overall program is called the Electronic Universe because we use
and
present a lot of electronics and digital technology.&nbsp; We feature
three
major digital items: Professor Bothun's new JAVA (interactive
web-based)
virtual physics labs/demos, projects using a CCD (digital camera), and
Oregon
Research Institute's new Sun-Earth-Moon virtual reality software.<br>
          <br>
I like at least 60-90 minutes, but we can do a 30-45 minute session or
multiple
sessions.&nbsp; I don't mind doing several repeat sessions during a
day.&nbsp;
Minimally, I bring a laptop and LCD projector, so the room needs to
have
a screen, be darkenable, and have a table for the projector and
computer.&nbsp;
If we are doing any of the technology pieces, then I bring in a
portable
CCD Camera and/or a small Telescope.&nbsp; If we are doing basic Solar
System/Sun-Earth-Moon,
we may do some activities outdoors (scale models, and solar viewing).
&nbsp;<br>
For the technology/measuring the sky program, there is extensive
hardware
setup, about 30 minutes, and also similar take-down time, and several
boxes
of gear to transport, so placing me in one location and rotating
classes
in works best.&nbsp; Since we do a lot of "hands-on" activities,
classes
should be under 30 students.&nbsp; We have found that "assemblies"
don't
work for our main inquiry-based type of program.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you'd
like
a show-and-tell or pictureshow type of general program for an assembly,
that
can be arranged, but our program is primarily an inquiry-based
introduction
to the science of astrophysics, with a lot of participatory activities.<br>
My schedule can get booked full particularly in the Spring, so please
contact
me several weeks in advance if possible.<br>
          <br>
Costwise, this year (2005)we are requesting between $10 and $100 per
school, regardless of number
of classes done, on a sliding scale, generally proportionate to the
number of classes done but with consideration of available school
budget. (Example: 1 small class would be $10, a small &#8220;assembly&#8221; or
morning&#8217;s worth of individual classes might be $30, a multi-day
presentation to six classes would approach $100.)&nbsp; This amount
goes to Friends of Pine Mountain Observatory, not to the instructor,
and&nbsp; is used to offset our overhead costs, primarily the
production/distribution of the prep video, curriculum materials, and
hardware usage.&nbsp; NASA's Oregon Space Grant currently covers
instructor cost and travel costs for trips throughout western
Oregon.&nbsp; For extended distant trips, we may request some
additional funding to help cover the travel expenses.&nbsp; Visiting
multiple destinations during one trip will help share costs.<br>
          <br>
          <b>CONTENTS OF OUTREACH CLASS SESSIONS:<br>
Variety of programs for ALL grade levels:</b><br>
          <br>
The basic presentation covers how students at any grade level can do
real
science with the Sky by making observations and measurements.&nbsp; For
grade
4 and higher we provide an introduction to how data can be collected
digitally,
and how digital data can be measured and put to use.&nbsp; We generally
don't
present historical narratives, collections of statistics, nor cover
constellation
information or lore (we can point you to resources for these topics).<br>
          <br>
Prep session, prior to outreach, is very important, particularly to
clarify
vocabulary of objects and vastness of space.&nbsp; See below for
suggested
topics, and about the new free prep video.<br>
          <br>
Basic Theme: Surveying the Sky:&nbsp; If we examine the sky with our
eyes,
with a telescope, or with a camera, what do we see?<br>
          <br>
Can we characterize and classify objects by making observations?<br>
Sorting out objects by apparent size and brightness.<br>
Observing change in appearance and position over time.<br>
Arranging our data to use the data to draw rational conclusions.<br>
Making models to explain our observations.<br>
What are "physical characteristics" of objects/phenomena?<br>
Can we measure such characteristics of very distant objects?<br>
          <br>
We are concerned with the inquiry-based process of scientific research,
not
with "factoids".&nbsp; Our program stays away from "factoids" and does
not
deal with topics such as constellation lore/history (although these
topics
are excellent cross-curriculum content!)&nbsp; Often we deal with
questions
that do not have a "right answer" nor even any answer at this time.<br>
We encourage students to collect and evaluate data.<br>
          <br>
Integrated with the above investigative strategies, here are some of
the
specific content areas that we can work with your students to explore:<br>
          <br>
          <b>a.</b> Introduction to the Solar System:&nbsp;
Sun-Earth-Moon
and beyond:&nbsp; We can address motions/views of Sun-Earth-Moon and
Solar
System, using kinesthetic models, a new dynamic virtual reality
graphical
model, scale models, and lots of images from various professional
sources.&nbsp;
Why are planets and stars spherical?&nbsp; Why do they rotate?&nbsp;
Why
do the planets orbit the Sun in a plane?&nbsp; Why do we see the Moon
and
certain planets only at certain times?&nbsp; This program is suitable
for
early elementary, and can be adapted for higher grades where students
need
information for the Common Curriculum Goals Earth-in-Space Benchmarks.<br>
          <br>
          <b>b.</b> Introduction to Technologies to Explore Deep Space:<br>
How we know what we know about very distant objects/phenomena: <br>
We bring a small Telescope plus a portable CCD Camera that students can
use
to explore how distant light is collected and detected, and how digital
images
can be enhanced and measured.&nbsp; What are the two basic
measurements?&nbsp;
What can these measurements tell us about characteristics of distant
objects?&nbsp;
This material is very suitable for grades 4-12 and portions can be
adapted
for early elementary.<br>
We also use a variety of high tech JAVA based interactive graphical
"applets"
developed by Professor Greg Bothun at U of O to illustrate various
principles
of physics and astrophysics such as production of photons, production
of
thermal spectrum, and nature of detectors.<br>
Greg and ORI are both developing new virtual lab activities and we'll
showcase
these as they become available.<br>
          <br>
          <b>c.</b> Computer Labs: Two years ago we commenced this
activity,
six schools, from grades 3-12 were successful.&nbsp; We preload free
FITSVIEW
image analysis software plus a series of images to analyze.&nbsp;&nbsp;
There
are four pairs of images taken one night apart, that have one of the
four
outer planets (Saturn-Pluto) in each pair of images.&nbsp; The job of
the
students is to find the planet in each pair of images and then to
identify
which planet by measuring relative shift from night to night and also
comparing
brightness. We do this as a follow-up to the in-class session described
in
part b, above.&nbsp; If your school has a Windows or Mac lab, you can
participate.<br>
          <br>
          <b>d.</b> Overview of the Cassini-Hugens Mission to Saturn
and
Titan:&nbsp; A powerpoint presentation covering overview of mission,
spacecraft,
flight, scientific goals, and showing current images sent back from
Saturn
and its Moons.&nbsp; This program will work for larger
groups/assemblies.&nbsp;
We do some scale model activities but primarily focus on the
information
and pictures supplied by NASA and JPL.&nbsp; We furnish teachers with a
summary
handout sheet including URLs.<br>
          <br>
          <b>WORKSHEETS and EVALUATION SHEETS:</b><br>
          <br>
Most teachers have requested use of worksheets for classes at 5th grade
level
and higher.&nbsp; We normally bring a fill-in-the-blank style worksheet
for
duplication and distribution at start of class. &nbsp;<br>
We can send the master to you ahead of time if you wish to print it
beforehand.<br>
Sometimes we encourage students to use a blank piece of paper and then
we
make notes together on a projected window from the laptop.<br>
We supply a key for the teacher for use in review after the class.<br>
We also bring a page for students with a few questions to fill out for
feedback
for us on how the classes can be improved, and we supply teachers with
a
more detailed questionaire.&nbsp; These surveys can be mailed back to
me
and are usually done for homework or the next day, as our sessions
usually
run the whole class period.<br>
          <br>
          <b><br>
PREP VIDEO</b><br>
          <br>
Tom Cleveland, of Think Video/Lane Community Cable Television, and I,
have
put together a 28-minute introductory video for use prior to the
outreach
sessions, or as a stand-alone INTRODUCTION to EXPLORING DEEP
SPACE.&nbsp;
The material is suitable for ALL grade levels, but particularly
suitable
for Elementary and Middle School.&nbsp; We start with a brief
introduction
to the emptiness of space by taking an imaginary flight upward from
Earth,
noting the results and requirements of leaving the atmosphere and
running
out of air.<br>
Next we cover, using models, the vocabulary of Moon, Planet, Star/Sun,
Solar
System, Nebula, Galaxy, and Universe.&nbsp; Then we create a scale
model
of the Solar System and beyond on a real football field, an activity
you
can duplicate. &nbsp;<br>
Finally we explore the basic concepts of light, introducing viewers to
the
term "photons", and noting that to "see" anything we need a source of
photons
and a detector of photons (stars and our eyes).&nbsp; We tie the whole
program
together with a final demonstration with a flashlight to show how
photons
from a distant source spread out, thus why objects in deep space are so
dim,
so hard to explore. &nbsp;<br>
The actual classroom outreach program then gives the students the
opportunities
to explore the collection/detection/measuring technologies (telescopes
and
CCD cameras) and includes computer labs where actual research can be
done.
&nbsp;<br>
When you contact me to schedule your outreach session, I'll mail you a
prep
video along with several worksheets and answer keys to complement the
video.&nbsp;
I'll pick up the video when I come to your classroom.&nbsp; There is no
cost
for the video, but we do need it returned.<br>
          <br>
Responses have been very positive from Elementary and Middle
Schoolers.&nbsp;
Most High School students have felt that the video was too simplistic
for
them, although some have commented that the concepts/overview have been
very
helpful.<br>
          <br>
Our major concern is that students have the overview of vast distances,
hierarchy/vocabulary
of types of objects, and initial exposure to concept of photons for the
technology
program, as we don't have time within the class to cover these
topics.&nbsp;
For example, the students should understand the difference between a
Solar
System and a Galaxy, functionally, in appearance, and in scale.<br>
          <br>
If you don't wish to go this route or don't have enough time to get the
video
mailed to you, I can attach a basic vocabulary/distance scales info
sheet
to an e-mail message to you, or you can find this document at the
Friends
of PMO web site.<br>
          <br>
We will also be creating a video that demonstrates the use of FITSVIEW
and
AIP4WIN image analysis software.&nbsp; This will be distributed as
follow-up
materials for students interested in pursuing a research project using
digital
images of the sky.<br>
          <br>
          <b><br>
SOLAR VIEWING:</b><br>
          <br>
We now have a standard solar filter for the 6" telescope that I bring
to
classrooms, so if the sky is clear, there is potentially the
opportunity
to view sunspots.&nbsp; We can set up the telescope outside before or
after
class or during lunch or recess.&nbsp; This is not an H-alpha filter
like
we have at Pine Mountain that shows the solar prominences, but the
standard
filter still offers very interesting views of the solar "surface"
features.&nbsp;
Queing up to view through the telescope takes time, so this usually
doesn't
work well during a class period as too many students are left idle, but
is
certainly suitable as a supplemental before/after class/school activity.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>REQUESTS FOR SKY VIEWING IN EVENING:<br>
          </b><br>
Occasionally schools request an evening sky observing program in
conjunction
with the classroom outreach.&nbsp; This may be feasible, working with
your
local Astronomy Club/Astronomical Society, or with any other local
people
who can bring large telescopes.&nbsp; We can set up the portable CCD
Camera
on a table outside, and students have a great time taking actual images
of
some of the larger objects in the sky, such as galaxies, star clusters,
and
nebulas.&nbsp; We can discuss the arrangements for each request
specifically,
as resources vary considerably around the State.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>VIRTUAL REALITY (VR) Sun-Earth-Moon (SEM) project:</b><br>
          <br>
Oregon Research Institute (ORI), in Eugene, has created a VR program
where
the user can "fly" his/her craft around, above, and below the Sun,
Earth,
and Moon (other planets may be added later).&nbsp; The goal is for the
user
to conceptualize the motions, orientations, and views of these objects
by
being able to gain a wide variety of physical perspectives not normally
available.&nbsp;
Explorations include phases of the Moon and the orbits and periods of
the
Earth and Moon and their relationships to the position of the
Sun.&nbsp;
This program, called SEM, is funded by the Federal Department of
Education.&nbsp;
ORI Prime Investigator, Dr. Dean Inman, wrote the grant as a program
designed
to help Orthopedically Impaired (OI) students do science labs that they
ordinarily
would not be able to access.<br>
When I saw the software in early Summer, 2002, I was immediately struck
that
non-OI students should also be able to put these explorations to good
use,
and also noted that the software serves to illustrate many of the ODE's
Earth-in-Space
benchmarks. &nbsp;<br>
I am now working with ORI to develop teacher and student materials for
use
of the SEM program, and will be introducing SEM in many of my outreach
classes.&nbsp;
Dr. Inman and I will be looking for teachers who are interested in
collaborating
to investigate the efficacy of SEM, comparing how students learn with
conventional
strategies versus SEM, for both OI and regular students. &nbsp;<br>
The software is free and is available either as a download off the web
from <a
 href="http://www.ori.org/%7Evr/projects/vrscience/sem/index.html">http://www.ori.org/%7Evr/projects/vrscience/sem/index.html</a>
or from a CD-ROM
that ORI can send you.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fed Ed has also funded availability
of
high video performance computers from ORI for classrooms wishing to
participate.&nbsp;
Please contact me if you are interested in participating, whether or
not
you have OI students. <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>RESEARCH PROJECTS:</b><br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Inquiry-based RESEARCH
PROJECTS for ALL GRADE LEVELS:</span><br>
Digital data can be used by students of all ages.&nbsp; Here are some
suggested
projects that we can assist you to implement in your classroom.&nbsp;
Depending
on student academic levels, you could use/adapt several projects at a
wide
variety of grade levels.<br>
The projects can begin as inquiries after viewing some initial digital
images
of the sky (or viewing the real sky for that matter!)&nbsp; If you come
up
with your own project, we can assist you with data and data analysis
software.&nbsp;
We can demonstrate a basic project listed below during outreach and can
then
walk your students through the project in your computer lab.<br>
          <br>
          <b>a.</b> How many stars (how many galaxies)?<br>
Starting from a rudimentary counting exercise, students can explore
images
from various areas of the sky and images taken with a variety of
exposure
times.&nbsp; Questions can be generated concerning distribution of
objects,
types of objects, and how much of what's out there we are really able
to
see, why and why not.&nbsp; This is a very open-ended project that can
be
a real eye-opener to the vastness of space and the nature of how
science
is done and is very suitable for lower elementary grade levels.<br>
          <br>
          <b>b.</b> Do any objects shift position in the sky?<br>
This involves astrometric (positional) measurements, over a period of
time.&nbsp;
Starting by "blinking" (comparing) images of the same area of sky over
one
or more nights, students can search for objects that shift relative
position
and then attempt to explain the shift observed.&nbsp; Students can
derive
the basic relationship between distance and parallactic shift and thus
sort
out Solar System objects versus Galactic objects, discover asteroids,
and
can begin to sort out the various planets at various distances and
approximate
the orbital radii.<br>
See the astrometric project, initiated by Silverton High School
Teacher,
Ray Kaser, described as the computer lab option in the Contents of
Outreach
Sessions section above. <br>
          <br>
Another astrometric project involves the search for asteroids.&nbsp;
This
is an authentic research project with potentially very useful results
(saving
Earth!).&nbsp; Students can request data or can scan archived
data.&nbsp;
Best done with Richard Berry's AIP4WIN image analysis software, which
when
combined with a digital database, will allow the user to accurately
determine
coordinates of any candidates.&nbsp; Data can then be compared with
list
of known objects compiled by Lowell Observatory, and if object is truly
a
new discovery, the discoverer may participate in the naming of the
object.<br>
          <br>
          <b>c.</b> Why are some objects brighter than others?<br>
This involves photometric (brightness) measurements and leads to
measurement
of distances, temperatures, sizes, and brings up issues of instrument
calibration.&nbsp;
At the basic level, students can intuitively conceptualize the
relationships
and can begin to characterize and classify objects in the sky. &nbsp;<br>
We have archived sets of data of stars of several constellations, which
can
be measured for relative brightnesses.<br>
At more advanced levels, we can furnish images filtered in various
colors
(BVR) which would lead to measurement of temperature from the Planck
Blackbody
Curve and ultimately to construction of an H-R diagram and determining
stellar
age.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>REQUEST or DOWNLOAD DATA (IMAGES of the SKY):</b><br>
          <br>
Archived data can be "FTPd" (we like WS_FTP software to do this) or
"Timbuktud"
(Timbuktu software from www.netopia.com) from<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> IP 128.223.164.30</span>.<br>
Contact Rick (<a href="mailto:rkang@efn.org">rkang@efn.org</a>) for
user name/password.<br>
Also contact Rick if you want to acquire new data either from our
COWCAM
(1/2 degree FOV, BVR filters available, 1Kx1K<br>
pixel CCD, 5 Meg FITS format images) or from our PIGGY (1 degree FOV,
no
filters, 242x375 pixel CCD, 300 KB FITS format images), we may be able
so
set up remote imaging sessions for you.<br>
We encourage you to select suitable targets and to furnish us with the
identity,
RA/DEC, and desired integration time and filters for your
targets.&nbsp;
We can provide an initial digital sky tour if you wish.<br>
There is a $20 charge to set up a remote imaging session, and you will
need
to have Timbuktu software (from <a href="http://www.netopia.com">http://www.netopia.com</a>)
running on your computer.&nbsp;
There may be local firewall issues to resolve.<br>

          <b>HOW TO BRING YOUR CLASS TO PINE MOUNTAIN OBSERVATORY:<br>
          </b><br>
          <b>DETAILS FOR OBSERVATORY TOURS:</b><br>
Please make advance reservation with Mark Dunaway,
markpmo@oregon.uoregon.edu
or 541-382-8331 if you are planning to bring your class (or any group
larger
than 10 people) during regular tour season<br>
(Fri-Sat evenings Memorial Day weekend through September, or during<br>
the off season).<br>
We are now closed due to winter weather, but come March or April if the<br>
snows don&#8217;t make the road impassable, you may be able to bring your
group<br>
to PMO if Mark can fit you in&#8230;dark moon weekends fill quickly).<br>
&nbsp; <br>
Program starts at dusk, check with Mark for exact times as may change
as
darkness falls later or ealier.&nbsp; Also check with Mark on rates,
we&#8217;ve
had to increase our group rates as we&#8217;ve had to find funding for staff
to
drive up.&nbsp; We&#8217;re trying to hold regular Fri-Sat summertime drop in
rates
to $3.00/visitor.&nbsp;&nbsp; Dress warmly (can easily get below
freezing
at the 6500 foot elevation!) and bring a small flashlight covered with
red
cellophane or a brown paper bag (to protect everyone's night
vision).&nbsp;
We furnish star charts.&nbsp; You can stay up with us all night,
weather
permitting.&nbsp; Check the web site for Quick Cam views of the weather
during
daylight before you come up.&nbsp; There is a Forest Service campground
just
across the parking lot from the Observatory, first come, first served,
no
reservations, no fees.&nbsp; Primitive campground, you need to bring
water.
&nbsp;<br>
Some schools have made arrangements with teachers at local Bend<br>
schools to use their gym to camp out in.<br>
Try to pick a non-Full Moon night (moon is very bright and washes out
fainter
objects).<br>
For further details, see the How to Visit PMO link and/or call
541-382-8331.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
          <b>OBSERVATORY TELESCOPE STATUS:</b><br>
15" Telescope now has digital setting circles, making finding objects
much
easier.<br>
24" Telescope has minor tracking problems in some positions, we
continue
to work on this, but telescope and PIGGY CCD are basically in service.<br>
32" Telescope continues to be available for limited collection of
research
data with the COWCAM, including images filtered with B, V, or R
filters.&nbsp;
Contact Rick with your initial proposal, I'll put you in touch with
Professor
Bothun to work out the details.<br>
Solar Viewing: We now have an H-alpha solar filter for use on our
portable
8" telescope, that allows visitors during daytime to view the huge
prominences
blasted out by the Sun.&nbsp; Normally we have this telescope set up
outside
the 24" dome on Saturday afternoons, 2-5 PM during the regular
Visitors'
Season.<br>
