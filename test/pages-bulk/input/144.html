  Mixed it according to label recommendations, then you probably
will get a good kill of the parts you sprayed.  The first sign is curling and
twisting (epinasty in plant physiology terms), and it may take a week or
two to look real dead.  Some resprouting may occur from areas of the root
system that the chemical did not reach. Respray after these sprouts reach
8 or 10 inches (too soon and there may not be enough leaf area to absorb
enough chemical).  Triclopyr (the active chemical) is sooo much more
effective on woody plants than Roundup.  But it really does little to kill
grass family plants, or rosette type weeds that are already bolting.

   We just bought a piece of property and it has poison oak. It is
   covering a huge granite rock about 8 foot tall and 30 foot around.
   It is also growing between the rocks to the height of 10 to 12
   feet and also growing like a vine over the rocks. I got two spots
   the first time. It is maddening to itch like that. I went out
   and bought a <B>gallon of round up</B>. The kind you dilute with
   water to the correct consistency. I sprayed that huge plant. It has
   been reduced to dead leaves and dead branches. I used about one
   forth of the gallon to do the job. The gallon cost $85.00 but
   even though I am on a limited budget it was worth every penny.
   And I still have enough round up just in case it comes back 
   up. Then I was clearing a spot on another part of our property
   and got it again.  
The first two places to break out were the ones where it was
      before and then it spread. Tonight I actually took a bath in
      diluted bleach. Tomorrow I am going to go spray that new
      plant. Thanks for your web site about the evils of poison oak
      and ivy. Naoma Hayes

   I have found <B>Brush-B-Gone foam</B> to be the best product for complete,
   easy removal of Poison Ivy. It is sometimes hard to find, perhaps
   they're discontinuing the foam? One can removed all the Poison Ivy
   in our large backyard with one application per plant (including a
   vine running some 20+ feet up a tree, about 4" around at base), and
   because it's a foam it is much easier to not hit plants you don't
   want to kill.

   My comment is about <B>Round-up</B>, and its use on Poison Ivy etc.
   Guys, Round-Up doesn't work!! It's just that simple. It kills
   the upper leaves, but the roots remain. This product is a
   complete rip, and we are wasting our $$. And not just poison ivy,
   round up won't kill grass long term. What does work? Pick axes,
   hoes, gloves you wear for roses, and washing in cold water within
   one hour of known exposure.

<I>--"molly" (mollysimonds@NOSPAMhotmail.com) submitted 8/Jun/2003</I>
<BR>
<B>Editor:</B>  It is true that you might have to re-apply round-up but it will eventually kill poison ivy completely as I now have acres of no poison ivy to prove it. I have had to repeat my applications up to 3 times on some very resilient plants over a summer. You will not kill the big vines though and will need to cut a segment and use a herbicide containing triclopyr for those tough guys.
<BR>
Pick axes, hoes, and gloves are a sure thing.  The other nice thing about your comments is that its better for the environment and doesn't cost any money!  Thank you.

  Contact with poison ivy can leave you with a rash and persistent itch. 
This native perennial grows throughout Virginia, in woods, fields, and
sometimes in the garden.  It grows in sun or shade,
and in wet or dry places.  Its growth habit depends on where it
is growing, resulting in a trailing ground cover, free-standing
shrub, or a vine supported by trees, shrubbery and fences.
<p>

All parts of the poison ivy plant contain an oil, urushiol, which causes
the allergic reaction.  Most poisoning occur during the
growing season when the presence of lush foliage increases the
chance of contact, but the dormant stems and roots of the vine
can cause winter poisoning as well.  Individuals vary in their
sensitivity to poison ivy, but repeated exposure can lead to
increased sensitivity.  It would be a good idea for everyone to
avoid this plant.
<p>

Poison ivy appears in many forms.  The leaflets vary in size,
glossiness, and marginal notching, but always occur in groups of three. 
If you avoid all unknown plants with leaves composed of
three leaflets, you will be playing it safe.
<p>

Poison ivy is difficult but not impossible to eradicate.  The
chief difficulty lies in the chances of becoming poisoned when
trying to remove it.  Wear protective clothing, including gloves, whenever
you are working near it.  Pulling and grubbing are
effective means of removal, though they necessitate close contact and will
probably need to be repeated once or twice for complete control.  If time
is not an object, the vines can be smothered by completely covering them
with black plastic for several months.
Do not mow the plants as this will spew bits and pieces of
poisonous material over the area.  When removing poison ivy, take
frequent breaks to change clothes and scrub thoroughly with a
strong soap.  Wash contaminated clothing separately.  DO NOT BURN any
plants that you physically remove.  The resulting smoke can
cause severe lung damage if inhaled.

<p>

Herbicides are effective and allow you to control the plant
without getting too close to it.  Several commercial products are available. 
Check labels to find one that will control poison
ivy, and apply it as directed.  Many of the herbicides for poison ivy
control contain glyphosate.  This chemical is systemic.  It
is absorbed by leaves and transferred to stems and roots, and
slowly causes the death of the entire plant.  It must be applied to an
actively growing plant for this process to take place; do
not apply it during a drought when even poison ivy will not be
growing.  Glyphosate, like most herbicides labelled for poison
ivy removal, is nonselective and will kill any other plants it
contacts.
<p>

Where poison ivy has grown up tree trunks or into hedges, cut the vine
at ground level.  Remove as much of the stump and roots as
you can with a hoe or by pulling.  As regrowth occurs, apply an
herbicide to the leaves, or keep pulling up the growth.  With
perseverance, and probably of few itches, poison ivy can be
controlled.

  Here is one I found.  Mix 3 pounds salt with
1 Gallon soapy water; spray the solution on the plant's leaves and stems.
I have also used a combination of roundup and letting nature choke the plant
(ie. wild rose) myself.
<font size="-1">
<br>
<i>--Editor (July/27/1999)</i>
</font>
<p>
I'm an environmentally sensitive landscaper and landscape designer with a
good deal of experience in eliminating poison ivy from the landscape. And,
little as I like the prospect of using an herbicide, out of considerations
both for my personal health and for the environment, the only way I've found
to get rid of substantial colonies of poison ivy is by the careful and
responsible use of herbicide.
<p>
You can remove a single young plant or two by grasping it through a plastic
garbage bag and pulling it up root and all. Turn the bag inside-out over the
plant, and it's done. (You may have some growth return from broken roots,
but can get rid of them in the same way.)
<p>
<b>Glyphosate</b>--the active ingredient in Roundup and Rodeo--is sometimes
recommended for killing poison ivy. Because its active ingredient breaks
down quickly, I initially tried to use Round-up, but found that plants could
recover from as many as six applications over two years. Others with whom
I've compared notes also describe similar experiences. I've only used the
product as sold, with glyphosate.
<p>
The only thing that seems to work, in my experience, is a herbicide
containing <b>triclopyr</b>. I've used Ortho Brush-b-Gon with a great deal of
success. If I'm careful, I find I can spot-treat individual plants without
doing much damage to what's growing around them. For greater accuracy,
instead of spraying you can paint the herbicide directly on the leaves.

<p>
I hate to sound like a spokesperson for Monsanto. This company has many sins
to answer for. And, as I've said above, I'm reluctant to use herbicides. But
this product really does the job.
<p>
Use it with respect. Read the label and follow the directions religiously.
Wait for a day when the winds are still. Don't use it in or within ten feet
of a wetland. Use rubber gloves, and be careful not to breathe the spray.
Wash up thoroughly afterwards, and put your clothes in the wash right away.
<p>
<b>I strongly recommend against using salt to kill plants</b>. Yes, we use salt in
our food. But in the environment, in the quantities required, it's toxic and
persistent--much more so than Roundup or Brush-b-Gon. It does not break
down, and will continue to kill anything planted on the spot until it's
thoroughly leached away--a matter of years even in regions of high rainfall.
And even then, it continues to be a hazard, as it leaches into the
groundwater. Using it is much more environmentally damaging than using
herbicides whose sale for the purpose is allowed by the EPA.
<br>
<i>--Don Galbreath <garden01@NOSPAMbellatlantic.net> submitted 23/Dec/2000</i>
<br>
<b>Editor:</b>  Thanks Don for an excellent discussion!  I have been using <b>Roundup</b> exclusively
here on a little more than 2 acres and while it takes repeated spraying I 
have had reasonable results because it contains the ivy long enough that 
other more invasive plants can choke it out.  I am in year 4 of what I call my
experimental program and would call it a success this far given that I
have elminated about 1/4 acre of just poison ivy plants.  I have to
completely agree that the Ortho Brush-b-Gon product is 
incredible and I apply it with a paint brush to all large old growth stems.


<p>
"Glyphosate" will kill it.  It I guess is the active ingredient in
systemic killers.  I wonder if it can be bought "over the counter" instead
of in "round-up", etc.

Here is my way of getting back at that nasty plant and you don't have to spend alot of 
money...you need:
<pre>
1 cup of salt,
8 drops of liquid detergent,
1 gallon of vinegar,
</pre>
combine	the salt and vinegar in	a pan heat it up to dissolve the salt pour into
a spray bottle and kill away.  <b>Warning this will kill all plants</b> that you spray so 
don't spray	anything important good luck.

  I use the following on poison ivy, if it is in a place where I want 
to get rid of it:
<br>
<ol>
<li>
Growing in an open area (ie. field, etc.) - Mow it with the brush 
hog. After a while, if you mow it regularly, it will die.

<li>Growing up a tree - Cut the vine. If it is really big, use a
chainsaw. If it is smaller, use what we call "nippers" (long handled 
shear like tool).


<li> Occasionally, if it is growing in a place where either 1 or 2 
won't work, I spray it. For example, sometimes it will grow on the 
side of an outbuilding, but the vines are too small and numerous to 
cut easily. I use concentrated roundup diluted in water to the 
manufacturer's
specifications and spray it. It always works for me.
As far as getting rid of the rash, only time works for me.

big vines as I am worried about the chainsaw throwing more oil around.

  Goats.  Goats do an excellent job of cleaning out poison ivy and
other unwanted brush, especially when its growing up in the fence
line.

    <h1><img src="/extras/styles/poisonivy/red-minileaves.gif" alt="*" class="marker">Mulch, Tarps, Pulling</h1>





  I've taken out long-established vines with trunks
as big as your arm with but two or three strategic,
thorough cuttings and a bit of digging and pulling. 
I carefully note locations of major vine colonies
in the middle of winter here, when they're easier
to see and brittle to cut as well.
One had completely covered a large stone retaining wall,
at the bank to the ramp to the main barn loft.  In winter
I removed major sections of matted vines from the stones,
after cutting all along the perimeter of the wall.  I threw
mulch hay along the top of the wall and it killed the poison
ivy there without further ado.
I knew  that there'd be a good burst of new growth from the base of 
the big vine I chopped away and dug out, but part of that
would be mowed as part of the yard and the other would be
the rest of the project.  More runners would pull up as
the ground thawed, too.
Then I waited until the leaf growth was as good as it could
be before the seeds form.  I cut the vines twice each with a
sharp action of the corn knife, two or more inches apart,
digging aside the cut section.  That takes only minutes.
I usually let it rot in place or at least wilt down to
a dry brown before removing it to a composting area
for ornamental, non-food uses.  The <b>seeds are a big
source of food</b> for birds and end up under trees to a
large extent, so thick mulches can be used in places
where mowing isn't practical, as long as they don't
extend right up to the trees.
I search for separate smaller vines and pull them to find all
their branches.  It's often easy that way to get most of the 
ivy in a big area just by first locating a small number of
well-spread vines.  I have a spading fork, rake, and hay
hook that I use to lift stubborn vines rather than cut
into the dirt with the knife.  I also use nippers to
finish off each and every smaller sprout in the area.
At most I'll check it to remove any resprouts, once,
later in the season.
If I remove a plant I replace it with something else,
and I'll mulch heavily and position the replacements
once I see that the growth is all browned out.  This
is a plant that gets as indignant as any hothouse
ornamental if you demonstrate your willingness to
cut away at it with some persistence.  <b>It enjoys
thick mulches even less</b>.  Hell, I've killed some
vines just by dropping scrap visqueen and tarps
on them, which do the job in a season or two
and can be hidden under mulch until removed.  
One big cluster of vines used to live under a spot
where I subsequently stored a couple tons of <b>cypress
bark</b>, but it didn't seem to thrive at all once it was
under a few feet of slow-rotting mill byproduct  ...

  Bag the plants, roots and debris in plastic, then
take to the dumpster or land fill.  NEVER, NEVER,
NEVER try to burn poison ivy out or add to a burn
pile.  Smoke can and will carry the poison.  This
does damage lung tissue and can lead to a long
hospital visit or death.  If you ever do burn out an
area of brush, stay out of the smoke.  There may be
poison ivy that you don't see.<p><p />

    <h1>Remove from other Items</h1>





     Hi,Just wanted to thank you profusely for your site. Tons of useful
   information (more than I got from WebMD.) Most useful were the
   pictures (instead of the illustrations you tend to find elsewhere)
   which helped me realize I had more than one kind/growing habit of
   poison ivy growing in my yard. It took awhile, but eventually I
   found possible ways of washing the oil off my upholstry (you can't
   exactly throw a possibly contaminated couch into the washing
   machine.) Perhaps, if you've the time, a "section" on removing the
   oil from more than your hands and clothing would be useful. And
   lastly, simply reading about others who have gone through the same
   suffering as much (and more) than I am, has helped mentally. Thanks
   again :-) and much praise for your site :-)--Heidi m., a sufferer
   in central New Jersey

<B>Editor:</B> I would think it would come off rather easily with
any cleaner that is good with oil. Even plain old water.  The problem with the skin is that once the oil bonds, it is very
difficult to remove.  Not a problem with furniture, tools, etc.
Anyone else?

    <h1>Ammonium Sulfamate</h1>





     I'm fascinated that in all your site and the other sites you
   hotlink, there's absolutely no mention of <B>ammonium sulfamate</B>, sold
   under the trade name of ammate among others. My 'job' when visiting
   my grandparents in ipswich was to fill up the 2-gal pressure
   sprayer every morning and roam around their 75 ac looking for p.i.,
   and I did that for many years. Like glyphosate, it needed several
   applications at two-week intervals, but in my experience it was
   very effective. I know enough chemstry to appreciate its relative
   safety, and in my experience it's extremely selective, killing only
   the p.i. I can remember spraying it on a vine growing through a
   highbush blueberry and seeing only the p.i. leaves wilt. I'm very
   !$!#!$ that it seems to be completely unavailable now - perhaps
   because it's too cheap and commodity-like to be profitable when
   glyphosate and triclopyr can be sold instead? I'm tempted to try
   making it. I don't think it'd be too hard. My other grandmother
   swore by phenolic soap ['fels naptha'] for removing urushiol before
   the itch started, back in the '60s.
