<b>1. INTRODUCTION</b>
</p>

<p>The origins of computing machinery can be traced back to 3000
years ago when the Chinese introduced a primitive form of abacus,
or 300 years ago when Schickard, Pascal and Leibniz invented the
first arithmetic machines. For us at CERN it all started 30 years
ago when one of the first electronic digital computers, a huge
Ferranti Mercury, was installed. It was the beginning of a success
story which has changed the way to do physics and, as a matter of
fact, to do any work at all in the Laboratory.</p>

<p>The story goes on and the changes brought in by the new
information technologies continue to affect us at an astonishing
rate. Those who witnessed the beginning of the information era were
conscious of the potential impact of those mar marvellous machines
on Physics as well as on Society, but they could hardly imagine
what was to come. In retrospect, we can say that the 30 years which
separate us from the days of those first generation machines, have
been years of struggle, of sweat and tea tears, of doubt and of
painful reappraisal, but also years of discovery, of excitement, of
achievement and of pride to the actors in this unique
adventure.</p>

<p>Of those 30 CERN years, I missed only the first three. I did not
miss, however, the joys of programming first generation machines,
although in a different environment. Actually, when I joined CERN
early in 1962, the only machines around were still made out of
vacuum tubes. I am, therefore, rather well placed to tell my
personal account of the <i>what, why and how</i> of the evolution
of automatic computing at CERN.</p>

<p>I shall not even attempt to be exhaustive, let alone objective.
I shall tell the story as I saw it, or rather as I lived it.
Instead of compressing 262800 hours into 1, I shall select and
report only those events which, in my opinion, are either real
milestones or make an interesting story, and I shall follow them
through to their consequences, even if this means breaking the
strict chronological order. The basic features of the large
high-performance systems which have played a major role in the CERN
Computer Center are listed in <a href="#Appendix">Appendix
1</a>.</p>

<p>
<b>2. THE BIG BANG</b>
</p>

<p>It took six days for God to build the Universe and a little over
two years for the Ferranti engineers to produce our <b>Mercury</b>,
a large assembly of complex circuitry hidden inside a row of
austere cabinets, making few concessions ons to people's curiosity.
At about the same time the PS was built in five years and today one
can build accelerators 1000 times more powerful, always in about
five years. The Mercury was 1000 times less powerful (16.6 kHz)
than a modern personal computer which is now mass-produced by
robotized assembly lines at the rate of 2 or 3 per minute!</p>

<p>The purchasing contract was signed on the 25th of May, 1956 and
stipulated that <i>the machine with 1024 40-bit words of</i> <b>
fast</b> [ 120 microsec to read/write one word from the
accumulator] <b>core store</b> <i>and a <b>slow</b></i> [8.75 msec
latency] <b>drum store</b> <i>having a total capacity of 16384
words of 40 binary digits,</i> would be shipped to CERN <i>in early
February 1957 and installation shall be completed by 1st May,
1957.... The details of the progress of manufacture will be
submitted at intervals of one month.</i> The Mercury had a clock
cycle of 60 microsec. It took 180 microsec to add and 300 microsec
to multiply two long words of 40 bits. It had floating point
arithmetic. Division, however, had to be programmed. It is
interesting to note the absence of the word <b>software</b> from
the contract, the only relevant mention being: <i>any programs and
sub-routines which Ferranti will prepare will be made available to
CERN free of charge.</i> Unbundling and licensing were unknown
in the 50's.</p>

<p>The computer actually arrived during the summer of <b>1958</b>
and passed the acceptance tests in October of that year. Following
its successful introduction, a thick file of orders revealed the
urgent need for spare valves and of <b>tape bins</b> (a critical
device in those days of punched paper tape input/output!).</p>

<p>At the end of 1958, the availability of a programming language
called <cite><b>Autocode</b></cite>, attracted the first users to
the computer centre and marked the beginning of the 30 years of
computing covered by this paper. It is interesting to note that the
first <cite>Mercury Autocode</cite> compiler was written in 1956
(by R. A. Brooker), two years before the appearance of the first
<b>FORTRAN</b> compiler! It had many features which appeared later
in FORTRAN. Due to memory limitations, variable names were
restricted to a single alphabetic character (5-bit Ferranti code).
It is worth noting that in the mid 50's the European computer
industry was still competitive. As far as competence, innovative
ideas and successful products are concerned, European companies
like <cite>Ferranti, English Electric</cite> and <cite>
Elliott</cite> in England, <cite>Telefunken</cite> in Germany and
<cite>Bull</cite> in France had little to envy their American
competitors (e.g. <cite>ERA/Remington Rand, NCR, IBM</cite>). The
size and the drive of the American market were, however, going to
make the difference quite rapidly in the 60's.</p>

<p>The reasons behind the decision to acquire a Mercury were
technical, political and financial. Technically the Mercury was
definitely one of the most advanced machines around. It was
considered superior to the Ferranti Pegasus, to the Elliott 404, to
the English Electric 'Deuce', to the Bull 'Gamma 311' and to
drum-type machines like the IBM 650. Ferranti was set up to produce
a dozen units and CERN was going to get serial number 6. The fact
that Harwell and Saclay had ordered Mercury's was given a certain
weight. CERN had no experience in electronic digital computers and
it was better to be part of a club of users. As to the price (one
million Swiss Francs), it was five times cheaper than equivalent
American machines like the ERA 1101.</p>

<p>Discussions went on for several months at CERN in 1955 and 1956.
External experts were involved. Fifteen years after Konrad Zuse's
relay-based Z3 considered by many as the first general purpose
computer, ten years after the electronic ENIAC, and six years after
Maurice Wilkes' EDSAC, people were still debating on the virtues of
binary versus decimal machines, on the importance of floating point
arithmetic, on the size of words (the Z3 had 22-bit and the EDSAC
32-bit words; the ENIAC was a decimal machine with 10 digits
words. The size of central memory was 64 words for the Z3, 2n for
the ENIAC and 512 for the EDSAQ, and on the best way to input and
output data (punched film, 5-7-8 channels papertape, or cards).
Practical problems had to do with the unreliability of the
hardware, the organization of the operations and the recruitment of
experts. Obsolescence was already a problem.</p>

<p>CERN decided that the machine should be purely binary, that
32-bit words were too short, and that the speed should be as high
as possible (in particular multiplication time should be under a
millisecond). It also concluded that the speed and size of
memory were very important <i>(several tens of thousands of binary
digits</i> were a clear necessity), while the availability of
floating point hardware was considered a <i>very desirable,
although not quite indispensable, feature of a scientific
computer.</i> But what really <i>makes it worthwhile to have a
machine, is the enthusiasm for carrying out the most difficult
computations,</i> as an American physicist put it in a letter
describing his experience with a digital computer or <i>'the
courage to go ahead and solve problems which would have seemed too
difficult to do otherwise.'</i>
</p>

<p>The computers of that time had colorful names like ILLIAC at the
University of Illinois, AVIDAC at Argonne, MANIAC, UNIVAC, etc...
Most of them were prototypes. Everything was very much
experimental. The operations arrangements at the ILLIAC were
described as follows: <i>'The user deposits his punched paper tape
in a box with instructions or the operator. The operator takes
these tapes, and inserts them in the machine in turn. If the code
is correct, the machine delivers the answers and these may be
picked up by the user the next morning. If there are errors in the
code, the operator carries out the test routines requested and the
results of these tests are deposited so that these may be reviewed
by the user the next morning. Thus, the whole operation of the
machine becomes a fairly automatic affair'.</i> This was more or
less the style adopted for our operations thirty years ago.</p>

<p>One of the first applications at CERN was the analysis of the
papertape produced by the Instruments for the Evaluation of
Photographs (IEPs), used to scan and measure bubble chamber film.
The first reports convey a certain deception due to the slow tape
read/write speed. Since everything had to go through the
accumulator, the CPU was blocked during I/0. It was immediately
clear that there was a big mismatch between the power of the
computing engine and its input/output capability.</p>

<p>After some struggling with faulty tubes, tape bins, machine
instructions and <cite>Autocode</cite>, people with lots of data
discovered the existence of an IBM 704 in Paris, which offered
significant advantages such as <b>magnetic tape units, card
readers, line printers and FORTRAN!</b> FORTRAN II allowed
6-characters variable names and, most important, it simplified the
exchange of programs with Berkeley and Brookhaven. The 1959 CERN
Annual Report indicated <b>already</b> that <i>as the needs
increase, it will be necessary to envisage the replacement of the
Mercury by a more powerful system.</i> It was also quickly realized
that these so-called electronic brains required quite a lot of
human effort to be effectively exploited. Hence the proposal to
double in 1960 the computer center staff (from 10 to 20).</p>

<p>So, by the end of the 50's, the fundamental forces, sociological
and technological, characteristic of every computer service, had
been discovered, including the illusion that upgrading the
resources would solve all the problems and achieve the ultimate
goal, i.e. <b>make the users happy!</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>3. THE LESSONS OF THE EARLY 60'S</b>
</p>

<p>The next big news was the arrival of the <b>IBM 709,</b> an
improved version of the 704, in January 1961. It was still a clumsy
vacuum tube machine but it featured FORTRAN and all those fancy
peripherals apt to improve the <i>quality of life</i>.</p>

<p>The word length was 36 bits, the characters became 6-bit BCD,
and the core memory size jumped to 32K. The CPU was 4-5 times
faster than that of the Mercury. However, to compile a <b>typical
FORTRAN program could take several minutes!</b> Tape bins made way
for card trays. Magnetic tape units read and wrote at 75 ips on 7
tracks and the density was 200 bpi. Peripherals were attached via
their controllers to data channels. It was a significant advance in
that it allowed as many as six peripheral devices to access core
memory buffers while the CPU performed other work. Another
important device which came with the 709 was the so-called Direct
Data Connection, allowing for direct transmission of data from
external equipment to memory via a channel. The speed was not
ridiculous: in principle up to 1 Megabit/sec. The 709 was also
equipped with one of the first <b>interrupt systems.</b>
</p>

<p>The bad news was still the poor reliability, although the
progress was already quite substantial. Unscheduled maintenance
represented 11% of the total time. Scheduled maintenance took away
a time slice of similar size. So the down-time of the 709 compared
not too unfavorably with the up time of the very first electronic
computers.... The on-line card reader and the printer did, however,
slow down the operations considerably. After one year of experience
CERN added a small IBM 1401, in order to speed up the input/output,
the job sequencing and the operations. The concept of SPOOLing
(Simultaneous Peripheral Operation On-Line) with its 1/0 files
(virtual reader/printer) has its origins in those days. Programming
for the 709 was considered a difficult activity to be left to the
specialists who could understand and keep up-to-date with the new
techniques and the operating conventions. The machine was <b>an
expensive resource</b> which had to be used efficiently. To give an
idea, the list price was in the region of ten millions francs
(1960 Swiss francs!). In those days a <b>magnetic tape cost 60 $
(some 260</b> SF!). It was at that time that the first inescapable
committees <b>appeared, e.g.</b> Computer Scheduling Committee,
Computer Users Advisory Committee and the Data Handling Policy
Group.</p>

<p>The Mercury had still its faithful users but suffered from the
chronic lack of modern, fast peripherals. In 1962, as part of a
lifting operation, it was enhanced by the connection of an Ampex
tape unit, <i>compatible with IBM specifications</i> and operating
at 3333 characters per second (over 3 times the speed of the
fastest paper tape reader and some 20 times faster than a tape
punch). Also, two papertape-to-card converters were installed <i>to
ease the transfer of data from the Mercury to the</i> 709. By the
end of 1962 it was possible to read the paper tape from IEPs into
the Mercury, give it a first processing pass, write the results
on magnetic tape and input it onto the IBM 709 for further
analysis. The first application packages appeared at that time,
e.g. THRESH and GRIND used for the geometrical reconstruction and
kinematic analysis of bubble chamber events. It is amusing to note
that, in spite of the growing workload and the frantic development
of codes, the machines were normally switched off at weekends. But
the practice of 24 hours/day, 7-days/week service was around the
corner. It is also in interesting to realize that things like the
connection of the Ampex tape unit to the Mercury were entirely
designed and implemented on site.</p>

<p>The next problem was how to use all those <cite>Autocode</cite>
programs on the 709. One just wrote an <cite>Autocode</cite>
compiler for the 709. The difficulties of developing software were
soon to be learned. The first Conference recognizing the existence
of a software crisis was held in Munich in 1968. Why is software
always late and unreliable? People working today with modern CASE
(Computer Assisted Software Engineering) or OOP (Object Oriented
Programming) tools are still trying to solve the problem. But the
answer in those days was: <b>better programming languages</b>.</p>

<p>CERN FORTRAN was defined to ensure compatibility with other
laboratories and facilitate portability of codes. It was felt,
however, that FORTRAN was used <i>mainly for historical reasons</i>
and new, more powerful languages would be needed to fully exploit
the potential of the electronic computer. As we all know, CERN was
not affected by, or it missed completely, the language explosion
which started in the early 60's. ALGOL, Lisp, PL/I, PASCAL, Modula
II, ADA, C, PROLOG, etc... did not raise above the level of
minority cultures. FORTRAN evolved through its versions II, IV, 66,
77, 8X, and it still dominates the CERN programming landscape.</p>

<p>It took some time to saturate the 709, but it was already clear
that young physicists were becoming addicted. It was at that time
that the first embryonic Operating System appeared under the name
of FORTRAN Monitor System. Many other important events occurred
in the early 60's, such as the connection of computers on-line to
film measuring devices including the very fast automatic <b>flying
spot digitizers</b> (HPD, Luciole, etc..) forerunners of the modern
image digitizers and the first attempts to connect computers
directly to experimental equipment (on-line experiments). The IBM
709 was operated on-line to an HPD to measure both bubble and spark
chamber films. In September 1963 the 709 was replaced by a <b>
7090,</b> a transistorized version of the same machine, about four
times more powerful.</p>

<p>It was at that time that the investments and the efforts started
to pay off. Over <b>300 000</b> frames of spark chamber film were
automatically scanned and measured in record time using an HPD
Flying Spot Digitizer on-line to the 7090. At about the same time
computers were connected on-line to experiments to monitor the
equipment and to collect digital data from the first filmless
detectors (e.g. sonic spark chambers) onto magnetic tape. The first
successful demonstrations with fully auto automatic digital pattern
recognition showed that computers could be programmed to replace
slow human operators in a variety of tasks. Stories about computers
doing things faster, better and more reliably than human beings got
around producing the usual mixture re of emotional reactions. In
1970 the European Physics Society held a Conference at CERN on the
'Impact of Computers on Physics' and I remember the reassuring
statement of an eminent physicist that 'so far computers have not
significantly contributed to any discovery'. It was going to take
another decade to see the HEP community wholeheartedly accepting
the computer as a critical component of their research and
admitting it to their current technological foundation trilogy: <b>
accelerators, detectors and computers.</b>
</p>

<p>1970 was also the year when the <b>'CERN Computing and Data
Handling School'</b> was launched to educate young physicists and
stimulate the sharing of computing experience between high-energy
physicists and computer scientists. It turned out to be an
excellent idea. The School is still alive and well, fulfilling a
clear need. As to the cross-fertilization across the
physics/computer science boundary, it has developed into an ideal
partnership.</p>

<p>Actually the two disciplines have influenced each other from the
very beginning. It was the physicist Bruno Rossi who built the
first logic circuits which then were developed into computer
hardware, and physicists have always been among the most
demanding consumers of computer cycles. Enrico Fermi, when asked in
the early fifties which research project would he recommend to the
young Italian physicists, told them to design and build a computer.
Indeed, physics research could not have become what it is without
the computer, and conversely, the development of the computer has
been deeply influenced by the needs and vision of basic
research.</p>

<p>The study of the fundamental properties of elementary matter
involves the frontiers of human knowledge and pushes the technology
to the limit of what is possible. Computer scientists have been
playing with models and formalisms, architectures and languages,
inventing tools and methodologies of a rather theoretical nature
and they have been sometimes accused of developing general
solutions in search of specific problems. When a dense problem
space meets a rich solution space some good news can be
expected... Evidence of synergistic effects has been accumulating
ever since the beginning of the information era. <b>High-energy
physics and information technology</b> are among those disciplines
which, in the second half of our century, have shown the most
impressive advances.</p>

<b>FERRANTI 'Mercury' [1958-1965]</b>
</p>

<p>First generation vacuum tube machine <b>(60 microsec</b> clock
cycle, 2 cycles to load or store, 3 cycles to add and 5 cycles to
multiply 40 bit longwords, no hardware division) with magnetic core
storage (1024 40-bit words, 120 microsec access time). Mercury's
processor had floating point arithmetic and a B-Register (index
register). Magnetic drum auxiliary storage (16 Kwords of 40 bits,
8.75 msec average latency, 64 longwords transferred per
revolution). Paper tape I/0. Two Ampex magtape units added in 1962.
<cite>Autocode</cite> compiler. At the end of its career it was
connected on-line to an experiment (Missing Mass Spectrometer). In
1966 the Mercury was shipped to Poland as a gift to the Academy of
Mining and Metallurgy at Cracow.</p>

<p>
<b>IBM 709 [1961-1963]</b>
</p>

<p>Vacuum tube machine (<b>12 microsec</b> clock cycle, 2 cycles to
add and 15 on average to multiply 36 bit integers, hardwired
division and floating point arithmetic, index registers) with core
storage (32 Kwords of 36 bits, 24 microsec access time). Card
reader (250 cpm) and card punch (100 cpm). Line printer. Magtape
units (7 tracks, 75 ips, 200 bpi). Introduction of the Data
Channel. FORTRAN compiler. FORTRAN Monitor System.</p>

<p>
<b>IBM 7090 [1963-1965]</b>
</p>

<p>Transistorized second-generation machine ( <b>2.18 microsec</b>
clock cycle) with core storage (32 Kwords of 36 bits, 4.36 microsec
access time). Card 1/0, Tape units (7 tracks, 112.5 ips, 200/556
bpi). Eight Data Channels. Interrupt System. FORTRAN compiler.
Basic Monitor Operating System (IBSYS). Connected on-line to Flying
Spot Digitizers (HPD and Luciole) to measure bubble and spark
chamber films.</p>

<p>
<b>CDC 6600 [1965-1975]</b>
</p>

<p>Serial Number 3 (pre-production series machine). Transistor
machine designed by Seymour Cray and very compact for its time. CPU
clock cycle <b>100 nsec</b>. Core memory: 128 Kwords of 60 bits.
Memory access 1 microsec, but independent memory banks allowed for
up to one access per clock cycle. Instruction prefetch. Ten
overlapping functional units. Ten autonomous peripheral processor
units (PPU's) each with 4K of 12-bit words core memory. Huge disks
over one meter in diameter holding 500 million bits. Tape Units
(half inch tape, 7 tracks, 200, 556 and 800 bpi, and one inch tape,
14 tracks, 800 bpi). High-speed card reader (1200 cpm).</p>

<p>First multi-programmed machine in the Computer Centre. However,
SIPROS multiprogramming operating system was abandoned by Control
Data. Basic SIPROS operating system had to be made at CERN. Then
Chippewa OS (COS) was installed. It evolved to SCOPE which was
eventually used after adapting it to CERN needs. This resulted in a
non-trivial amount of changes, thus deserving the renaming to CERN
SCOPE. The 6600 was connected to various FSD systems and to two
on-line computers, the SDS920 and the IBM 1800, via CERN-made data
links. In terms of processing capacity the 6600 was about three
quarters of a CERN unit or ten times the 7090.</p>

<p>The change-over from the IBM 7090 was planned to take three
months starting in January 1965. Major engineering overhauls had to
be done instead during the first few years and ended up in a
two-months shut-down in 1968 in order to modify the 6600 to
incorporate logic and packaging improvements which had been
introduced in the production machines. During this long period of
struggling with hardware instabilities and software development and
changes, computing work was done partly by sending jobs to outside
computers and partly by processing data on a CDC 3400, and later on
a 3800, temporarily made available at CERN by Control Data.</p>

<p>
<b>CDC 3800 [1966-1968]</b>
</p>

<p>The 3800 was a member of the 3000 series CDC family of
computers, incompatible with the 6000 series machines. More
conventional than the 6600, the 3800 had a 48-bit architecture. The
core memory (64 Kwords) was replaced by a faster one (800 nsec)
during its staying at CERN. This machine was eventually acquired by
the State of Geneva and installed at the local University. At CERN
it was replaced by a CDC 6400. It is worth noting that CERN
acquired other machines of the 3000 s series, e.g. a 3100 for the
FOCUS project offering semi-interactive facilities and quick
sampling of experimental data at the central computers, and a 3200
for interactive graphics applications.</p>
