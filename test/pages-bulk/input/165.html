           what happened? <br>
          actually, no that’s not true, its all clear since I was on the no drug 
          kick during this small art festival and camping trip I went to on thursday.</p>
         
        <p> i met <a href="http://www.geocities.com/TelevisionCity/Station/1314/wdstock.html" target="out">someone</a> 
          from <a href="http://maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py?&amp;csz=Cromwell,+Ct" target="out">cromwell</a>, 
          a small-town located not two towns away via <a href="http://www.icq.com" target="out">icq</a>, 
          this funky way to talk to people anywhere in the world, but we were 
          talkin not 7 miles away. a couple weeks before, she icq’d me cause she 
          got super bored after a trip from europe, cause ct isn’t known for its... 
          anything. well, anyhoo, i told her to come to my <a href="http://www.gardenoflight.net" target="out">work</a> 
          to pick up her nondairy mac and chreese and say &quot;hello&quot; cause 
          its one thing to talk to someone all night with little text messages, 
          its another to actually say hello to a stranger, at least in ct where 
          we’re all too coo to say hi while walkin down the street. but shyness 
          was the cause this time, i was almost certain she did come to pick up 
          her yummy vegan treats, but she didn’t say who she was and i usually 
          don’t query people they’re name and life story while ringin up tofu 
          delights. work that day was weird, there had to be 20 very very attractive 
          women that decided to shop that monday and it was extremely hard to 
          try to pick her out. </p>
         <p><a href="http://www.icq.com" target="out"><img src="../../../images/woodstock/icq.jpg" width="150" height="148" align="right" border="0"></a>but 
           wednesday, my guess proved out correct, it was her, she confessed bout 
           being shy, &quot;but hey, lets do somethin!&quot; so that day we (her 
           name is kelly btw, sometimes i forget to add these little things in) 
           went to see a movie with her lion maned hair Ian and somehow i got talked 
           into going with her to rome, ny for a little r&amp;r. </p>
         <p><a href="http://www.icq.com" target="out"><img src="../../../images/woodstock/icq2.jpg" width="147" height="144" align="left" border="0"></a>&quot;but 
           i have to work on sunday and monday!, i’m goin to a play on thursday, 
           i want to see my girlfriend soon, its been like a week, i have a doctor’s 
           appointment on monday, i’m supposed to go skateboarding and swing dancing 
           on saturday, a friend i haven’t seen in a month and won’t ever see again 
           is coming for one day on friday, i have so much stuff to do before i 
           move!&quot; </p>
       <p>&quot;hey, your goin, its woodstock&quot; <br>
       </p>
       <p>i had to agree.. &quot;let me see what my girlfriend says, i’ll know 
         at about 1am... when do you plan on leaving?&quot; </p>
       <p>talked to her, actually tried to talk her into it to, but theres no way 
         she could go, she was workin too much in an attempt to live a life tat 
         she wanted, a life free of all the crap that surrounded her, and anyways, 
         if she was gone for more than twelve ours, the people she was staying 
         with would put her on a missing person’s list and she would be dragged 
         home. but got a similar statement fromn her: &quot;dude, go i’ll make 
         it up to you when you come back&quot; </p>
         
        <p><a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com" target="out"><img src="../../../images/woodstock/ticket.jpg" width="279" height="149" align="right" border="0"></a>so 
          thursday, after some fallouts with other people we were supposed to 
          go with we set out towards rome, actually, meriden, i had to buy a ticket, 
          smarty kelly got hers for a cool 100 off of e-bay, i went to filenes 
          with my gold chain wallet and coughed up $185.50 for the three day pass. 
          all the money coming from my scholarship i was presented to by the good 
          people at <a href="http://www.cox.com" target="out">cox communications</a>, 
          thanks guys, i’ll remember the trust you gave me as i steal books, live 
          off of credit cards and find a restaurant that’ll let me take 3 square 
          breaks a day on my offtime. <a href="http://www.filenes.com" target="out"><img src="../../../images/woodstock/ticket_master.jpg" width="279" height="220" align="left" border="0"></a></p>
         <p>we actually met up with two people we were supposed to meet up with, 
           a twenty three year old girl who wouldn’t stop talkin bout her boyfriend 
           and her mother, who had total control of her life. be in their car they 
           had a radar dectector, guaranteeing a speeding trek across the native 
           american named cities and counties of upper NY, so it was all coo, till 
           we found ourselves stuck behind them for hours on end in the left lane 
           goin 55, angry people behind us, angry people in the car, actually, 
           just kelly and i, kelly used to getting passed once a trip, flooring 
           that blue tercel, now stranded behind a prism with a homemade psychedelic 
           &quot;woodstock or bust&quot; poster. the second rest stop we went to, 
           we decided to lead with our car, and as i dozed, we somehow lost the 
           other car, i looked at the speedometer, a cool 85, as the the tercel 
           began to shake and vibrate from the shear magnitude that 12 cylinder 
           beast mustered up. </p>
         <p>we made it to rome at a pitiful time, it was 730, the air was cool 
           but choking with anticipation and fumes of cars full of rampumctious 
           youngins just ichin to have a good time. traffic was extremely tolerable, 
           we parked right by one of two stages, and walked with our belongings 
           : <br>
       </p>
         <p>me, sleeping bag, 3 shirts, snowpants (i dunno either) long underwear, 
           2 pairs shorts, two pair pants, no extra boxers or shoes, </p>
         <p><a href="http://www.snapcracklepop.com/" target="out"><img src="../../../images/woodstock/rice.jpg" width="309" height="186" align="right" border="0"></a>kelly: 
           sleeping bag, one person tent, food (p+j, two loaves of bread, rice 
           crispie treats, crackers) clothes, lactaid pills. </p>
       <p>we were set, be prepared my mom/scout leader told us, yeah we’ll make 
         it 5 days, no problem. </p>
         <p>it took about an hour to walk around the whole airport/concert area 
           to get to our campsite, loo did we know, this little excursion would 
           be just routine. they checked for no metal, no glass, no cans, but didn’t 
           care bout drug at all, and i really didn’t care. i’d rather have 200,000 
           lazy tired paranoid people around me as i wandered throught ny’s third 
           largest city than having a quarter mil drunken people slobbering around 
           me, beer couldn’t be brought in cause of the container, but rest assured 
           they were sold at $5 so all the rich kids could get their kicks, hey 
           it was cheaper then water. </p>
         <p><a href="http://maps.yahoo.com/py/maps.py?&amp;csz=Rome,+NY" target="out"><img src="../../../images/woodstock/woodstock_map.jpg" width="482" height="337" border="0"></a><br>
           pitched tent in the slapdash tenement, tried to figure out the spider 
           web road system, and went out to wander the vendors, concession stands 
           and music that had already started early. </p>
         <p>checked out all the hippy bead places, hot dog stands and saw parliament 
           funkadelic. good day. i guess a local radio station was given out free 
           woodstock frisbees in mass. i small corner of woodstock’s airspace turned 
           into the testing ground for 300 frisbees to fly this way and that, the 
           effect was curiously calming and just a taste of what the vibe would 
           be for the weekend, just everything goin everywhere but nothing horrible 
           happening, just enough anarchy to have a good time. </p>
         <p>found the tent and found some visual cues to tip us off....</p>
       <p>yellow caution tape mucked around a tree... crappy bright orange tent 
         before ours... flying high tie dye wearing college student on the fence... 
         ok, all set. </p>
       <p>got up early, too early, the sun touching the tent made an instant humidity 
         machine, i woke up sweating from my chest and stuck to my coleman sleeping 
         bag, getting up to see our once vacant campsite full and new neighbors 
         to meet. </p>
         <p><a href="http://www.tattootheearth.com" target="out"><img src="../../../images/woodstock/tatoo_earth.jpg" width="264" height="200" align="left" border="0"></a>so 
           kelly and i began to wander some more stands, saw the tatoo shop and 
           watched some awful good looking girls go topless so some middle aged 
           man could airbrush their chest to decency, at least woodstock decency. 
         </p>
         <p>walked to the main stage to catch the ending of james brown getin down 
           with his black self as the intermission gave me time to check, or steal 
           someone's schedule to see the next band, jamiroquai, not my fav, but 
           thi shat he had on and his dancin &quot;cried homosexuality&quot; as 
           my girlfriend sez, but thats all good, he made me shake my ass and start 
           off my day all soul funked out. live came next with their serious rock 
           all about the water, they impressed me with their state of mind. sheryl 
           crow came next, so we decided to get the fug outta there to eat or wander 
           some more, anything's better than that.</p>
         <p> came back to see the last of dmx, and readied for a triple line up 
           of the offspring, korn and bush. offspring was fun to listen with, honestly, 
           safe punk for everybody, but they made nsync jokes so they were go enough 
           for me, korn were kinda korny to me, i’m still with the opinion bloody 
           beavis and butthead had with them being kinda unoriginal and lost in 
           a soup of mirroring bands, but the lead singer guy was wearing a kilt, 
           so big ups to that. kelly was totally in love with bush so we had to 
           weasel ourselves to the tippidy front of the stage, i’ll have to admit 
           that i thought gavin, the lead singer guy, was cute in a totally non 
           homosexual way, and so 4 people to the front up went kelly to crowd 
           surf to the front to leave me alone with her $300 elph camera singin 
           to bushe’s cover of &quot;this one goes out to the one i love&quot; 
         </p>
         <p><a href="http://www.peta.com" target="out"><img src="../../../images/woodstock/chicken.jpg" width="130" height="128" align="left" border="0"></a>found 
           moby was playing at the aircraft hanger rave afterwards, so after the 
           show, i found the veggie burger stand, got one with everything, a big 
           cookie, a frozen nonfat yogurt and icky food bar, then realizing i had 
           3 more days to survive the retardedly high prices and only seeing $20 
           of the $300 i took out in my wallet, oh well, guess i’ll just make alot 
           more pb and j sandwiches....</p>
       <p>but made it to moby and moby was awesome. for a techno &quot;artist&quot; 
         he came out with drummer, bass player and guitar and an odd assortment 
         for himself, along wit hthe usual electronic keyboard thingy. </p>
         <p><a href="http://www.peta.com" target="out"><img src="../../../images/woodstock/small_chicken.jpg" width="152" height="151" align="right" border="0"></a><a href="http://www.hyperreal.org/music/artists/moby/" target="out">moby</a> 
           was blazin on the guitar, bangin on the drums, makin good noise that 
           made me happy happy. go see moby if you have a chance, that little vegan 
           can make some good tunes. his last song(?) was just him and the computer, 
           making a low, hollow beat the progressively got fast and faster while 
           he stood up on the table and looked all krovy krovy scary with white 
           lights mimicking campfire ghost story sessions. </p>
         <p>after moby, moby fan needed to get home, but home was hard to find 
           after all that music and miles to walk with little knowledge of where 
           mi was supposed to go. i literally was walking for an hour and a half 
           through the maze of tents, people and port o potties tryin to find that 
           damn tent, i gave up and decided to sleep in a corner under a huge american 
           flag a tent circle brought, one of those monsters that you have to steal 
           from a government building, and wait till the mourn. passing the same 
           guy in the chair with the unsightly look on em, the same people playing 
           the drums, the same 40 year old bastards tryin to get all the girls 
           to show em their titties was too much. i turned around and saw in the 
           trees the caution signs, turned slightly left, saw the crappy orange 
           adobe, looked beyond, and their was my hokey tent, i climbed in at 4:00 
           am and woodstock day one ended. </p>
         <p><a href="http://www.aranet.org" target="out"><img src="../../../images/woodstock/racist.jpg" width="174" height="173" align="left" border="0"></a>i’m 
           not sure when i got up, but it was way too early. at what was now the 
           usual pb and j sandwhiches, the bananas were getting a little too ripe 
           there, especially after i stepped on them from the night before. but 
           such is life. saw this massachusettes band named guster, which was coo, 
           got passed out free condoms which was excellent and checked out all 
           the grassroots independent tents trying to make a difference. signed 
           a million petitions on gun violence, abortion, kelly bought this weird 
           thing you fill with water and it keeps you warm for ten dollars, we 
           then found the same thing for 3 for ten dollars, heh heh. got miself 
           to the anti racist action tent and saw all the cd’s that they were givin 
           for donations and realized i had all of them cept 1, i made a note to 
           buy it and this book on the philosophy of punk, good reading. </p>
         <p><a href="http://www.aranet.org"><img src="../../../images/woodstock/ssa_kcik.jpg" width="187" height="190" align="right" border="0"></a>counting 
           crows was ahh... boring (&quot;this is a song about when i was in my 
           twenties and i wasn’t doing anything&quot;) , limp biscuit was unapologenically 
           dumb, rage against the machine rocked (of course) and metallica got 
           silly after the 4<sup> </sup>t h encore. after metallica, i once again 
           went back to the rave this time to see <a href="http://www.astralwerks.com/fbs/" target="out">norman 
           cook</a>, who i deemed the dork of woodstock. i got real close and saw 
           how he mixed his rhymes, ciggarette in one hand, beer in the other, 
           dopey buck toothed smile and horrible haircut, makin the jocks and hippies 
           dance dance dance. i honestly don't know how he does what he does, it 
           looked like he had like two turn tables, he'd take a live sample, screw 
           around with it, make a transition from the last beat while looking at 
           the crowd and flailing his arms, and unlesh his new tune, it was interesting, 
           but got kinda boring when you have no room to dance and people wanted 
           to crowd surf (?). </p>
       <p>oi </p>
       <p>got outta there in time to see the smoke from a fire near the mountain 
         bike course lurking towards the aircraft hanger rave spot and found my 
         way home first shot. </p>
         <p>third day last day, totally tired of my wet shoes, the bathrooms or 
           lack of them, the cost of food, the smell of other peoples sweat on 
           me, the amount of change i didn’t have, the fact that i had to go home, 
           the fact that i didn’t know wat was up with my girlfriend. </p>
         <p><img src="../../../images/woodstock/fresh.jpg" width="97" height="97" align="right">did 
           the last of the wandering of the stores, kelly finally got a green shirt 
           she dug, i couldn’t find anything for my girl jess, for the quarters 
           i found in my wallet, but i kept searching. </p>
       <p>saw elvis..... </p>
         <p>costello, sat down twenty people away to listen to jewel yodel, kelly 
           once again fell in love at the lead singer, this time of creed, and 
           i got myself physched to see my favorite band of the show, the red hot 
           chili peppers, </p>
         <p><img src="../../../images/woodstock/fresh_smile.jpg" width="94" height="94" align="left">i 
           really wanted to be close for the peppers, got about 9 people away from 
           the front, the feeling that there is 250,000 people trying to get to 
           where you are is pretty core. i looked around my backside to see what 
           the hell was sticking out and saw a mother and her two little children 
           right in front of the stage. the mother was obviously in total delusion, 
           thinking she would somehow make it through the set, she was trying to 
           get all these tall strong guys near her for added protection. kelly 
           and i noticed that we were surrounded by lots of teenage girls, which 
           usually means that we’re in no fly zone for crowd surfers and mosh men.</p>
         <p><img src="../../../images/woodstock/bumpersticker.jpg" width="204" height="551" align="left">this 
           being not the case as flea comes out stark naked and starts the chilli’s 
           set. which rocked unequivetly, i sang with them in all there songs, 
           as the crowd in back of me pushed with the force of the trojan army’s 
           opponents. i had to hold on to kelly, who held on to anything she could 
           to survive this total crushing force of the fans persecuted with the 
           same conditions as i, but i didn’t care, the songs were good, the peppers 
           were inside, anthony’s hair was bleach and short, the songs melancholy, 
           funky and honest, the crowd fuckin crazy, the set seemed to short, the 
           fires </p>
         <p>the fires!? <br>
           before the planned encore by the red hot chili peppers, it was announced 
           that there was a small fire near one of the towers and if we all cooperated 
           the firetruck could go in and take it out, i looked around my shoulder 
           and saw three nice blazing demons all scatter brick a brack around the 
           whole place. earlier that day the pax tent, which worked for less gun 
           violence in the usa, was giving away free candles for a vigil, i didn’t 
           see no vigel, so i think everyone used them for the song &quot;under 
           the bridge&quot; and then later these little waxy things made great 
           starters,oop. the peppers i guess wanted to finish and they did, the 
           only thing i could say that sucked was no higher ground, but a new tradition 
           was made; all menstruating women had to throw their tampons on stage, 
           i think i heard of that one before, but people did it, great another 
           thing being thrown at me. </p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p>walking back after the last set was interesting. kelly’s sandled feet 
           weren’t quite operational, so i offered to piggy back her all the way 
           back to camp, missing the rioters, the fires, the drunken masses, just 
           the masses, the people throwing whole tables and metal cans into the 
           fire, the leaking bathrooms and drinking fountains. the fires were awesome, 
           i totally dug the whole anarchy fuck everything mentality thang, i didn’t 
           dig it when i thought of fires near my tent, and the rioters near the 
           tent and the grrr.... not a happy night.</p>
       <p>finally got all set to collapse in my stinky sleeping bag with kelly, 
         got into that nice happy floaty feeling and then i hear. </p>
         <p>&quot;oh my god, get out get out!&quot;, </p>
         <p>i look up to see about five people flying away from my tent. i honestly 
           thought the tent next to me caught on fire, which wasn’t much of a leap 
           of faith since they kept me up with their drunken/high/wasted philosophy 
           about life and breakfast cereals, this guy’s laugh was unbearable, hyena 
           like, uncontrollable crap. </p>
         <p>but lo, my fear/hopes faded just a bit as i saw it was a bunch of darn 
           hooligans that stole one of the souped up golf carts to take a ride, 
           he rode over one tent, which was vacant i think and got the fug outta 
           there with a winter ass shade on his face just mowing throw everything. 
         </p>
       <p>yells of, &quot;i heard this is has been deemed a national disaster, 
         the fuckin national gaurd is coming, their closing us off, we’re under 
         martial law!!!&quot;<br>
       </p>
       <p>but i was tired, i put on my contacts just so the next time i get awaken 
         by screams of tripping out girls or a tank rolls by, i could at least 
         see myself die. i needed to get to work on monday, it was supposed to 
         be my last day, i couldn’t miss that. </p>
       <p>3 hours of sleep is all you need.</p>
         <p>i looked over to the tent next to me that was giving me hell. deserted. 
           no one there. just a box of cereal samples, the collapsed tent, trash, 
           (shit that stuff was everywhere) and a prize for me. three beat up bead 
           necklaces. two purple, one green, showing the hellbent week in their 
           condition, and free for me, perfect. i plan on telling an extrapolated 
           version of that itty bit and give her the beads, maybe for a goodbye 
           gift, maybe just to end a night of talking and holding each other. we’ll 
           see...</p>
       <p>&nbsp;</p>

          frapachinos later a large (i mean large) hazelnut coffee and 2 hours 
          into driving back to ct, i was filled with astonishment of the show 
          i went to the people i saw, the good times, the fuckin bathrooms, the 
          messed up showers, the bands the bands. a new friend to miss when i 
          move, couldn’t beleive i didn’t see anyone i knew. got to work a half 
          hour late, high on adrenaline and caffeine, no one even asked what that 
          green band around my neck was or those 3 sets of beads around my neck. 
          went home.. tried to collapse, went out again skateboarding. which in 
          the state of my knees, legs feet and mindset should have been impossible, 
          but those kickflips kept coming out. i found myself screaming at anyone 
          i saw, being totally rash and filled with the fucked up mentality that 
          the show gave me. it hasn’t calmed down, i hope it doesn’t. life’s too 
          short to play it safe, i’m glad i blew off all those important things, 
          spend all my college money, went with someone i barely knew and had 
          alot of fun. summers been so good to me, i’ve been living this song 
          mark told me about, i’ve been doing so many crazy things this summer, 
          i thought the worst was getting into a relationship with a girl i just 
          met and have to leave in two weeks, but this show is quite a close second. 
          i know people are goin to blow off the show as what it eally was, corporate 
          sponsored greed, media driven hype, spring break in the summertime, 
          but screw that, it was fun, it was scary, its something i’m glad i was 
          apart of and something now that i have to get the vdeo for just to see 
          myself again. </p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p>good things: </p>
         <p><br>
           no fights <br>
           i don’t think i saw one person get there ass kicked. my theory for this 
           is simple. i could have beat the shit outta someone during a show that 
           ticked me off, but about twenty people would do the same thing to me. 
           kinda a nuclear war, no winners scenario, kept the balance because of 
           fear of the outcome. either that or everyone was too tired to fight 
           or didn’t want to get all stinky after taking that one shower for the 
           week. </p>

           pride 
         <p> 
         <p>i didn't check a map or anything, so i'm not sure how far from canada 
           i was, but everyone from canada showed it by wearing the red and white 
           maple leaf flag on em, patches, t-shirts, whatever, it was really cool 
           maybe they didn't want to be thought of as american while goin to woodstock, 
           maybe their government has brainwashed their little minds, maybe i should 
           be so proud of my country (ha!) but thats not gonna happen anytime too 
           soon lots of stuff to fix.. canada actually looks pretty good. vive 
           canada or however you say it in franche.</p> 
 
 
 
 
         <p><img src="../../../images/woodstock/shampoo_bottle.jpg" width="97" height="276" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5">kelly 
         </p>
         <p>kelly is cool, we’re both dorky computer people that hooked up online, 
           she made me realize you can start a real world relationship in the www 
           world, heck shes been doin since she had her 8086 and chatting on west 
           harford bulletin boards way before aol. i keep getting drawn in by really 
           laid back people, sorry kids no sex took place, we didn’t even wake 
           up in embarrassing positions in our teeny tent, so jess rest assured. 
         </p>
         <p>watermelon </p>
         <p>food was inflated to the point of idiocracy. 4 dollars for water?! 
           yeah. but there was a stand sellin watermelon for a dollar and that 
           waterelon was gooood. other good eats was the big meal at the tibetan 
           stand and al the vegetarian delights offered to me, its nice to not 
           have to go to a hot dog start to ask for just the buns. </p>
         <p>bad things </p>
         <p>bathrooms </p>
         <p>250,000 young adults can not use port of jons correctly, they’re too 
           much of a target to deface, push over and screw up. i would have certainly 
           paid 20 bucks more on my ticket for something, anything better. the 
           small was quite a scream, and having the bathrooms right next to the 
           clean water was a really good idea, really. </p>
         <p><a href="http://www.water.org/" target="out"><img src="../../../images/woodstock/water.jpg" width="238" height="215" align="right" border="0"></a>the 
           water system </p>
         <p>there was free water available to us. it came out of pipes that were 
           attached to these huge concrete things, but by the second day, all the 
           fixtures were busted and not in any shape to use, so water got scare 
           or just hard to get to. what was really something they must have looked 
           over was the drainage to all the water that freely flowed outta the 
           pipes. ie, there was none. there was a group of bathrooms on the top 
           of a small hill in the concert area. each day i walked near it, the 
           muddiness of the grass that sat beside it got larger and larger till 
           it covered clear across the whole aircraft field, it was impossible 
           not to get your feet wet and muddy and as such my feet stayed nicely 
           wet for four days, dish pan hands are nothing compared to my feet these 
           days. </p>
       <p>the playlist </p>
       <p>the list of when the bands were playing was available but it got as specific 
         as what day they were on and of what order. there was even groups not 
         on the bil that weren’t on the list at all, which made trying to schedule 
         your day impossible. the violent femmes were supposed to play, they weren’t 
         even there, damn website. i hate when informaton is falsified, oh well. 
       </p>
       <p>the prices </p>
       <p>everything was expensive </p>
       <p>big shock </p>
         
        <p>when i got halfway through writing this, i realized i could never write 
          everything that happened to me, theres too many details and odd stuff 
          that happened. i guess this is just goin to be something to remind myself, 
          to look at one day to use to get all the finer points back into mi noggin. 
          maybe you went to this show, and have another twist to it, i’d love 
          to hear, i’ll link to yours, or even post it for you lets<a href="mailto:justin@skazat.com"> 
          hear</a> it. </p>
        <p>sorry i didn't take any pics, something bout bringing my canon ae-1 
          with all its lenses, flash and motor drive didn't sit well in my mind, 
          luckily, this crazy person <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~eosnyhc/whitestock/" target="out">snaps 
          some good ones</a> </p>
