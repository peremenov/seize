       <div id="GuardianArticleBody">If the British and Irish Lions were ever to create an official team slogan, and in an age when you regularly hear talk of the Lions 'brand' that may not be too far off, then it could be, 'How to win friends and influence people'. Take the great squad who travelled to New Zealand in 1971. They are lauded not just because they were the first and only squad from these islands to win a series in a country where rugby is the national obsession, but also because of the influence they exerted on the domestic audience.<P>

Before that tour, any team with the temerity to believe they were the equal of the All Blacks were quickly put in their place. But these Lions were different: with flair, determination and panache they at first stunned and then seduced the home crowd. 'It would be hard to overestimate their impact on New Zealand rugby,' says Sean Fitzpatrick, a World Cup winner in 1987 and All Blacks captain for much of the Nineties. 'Let me give you two examples, one tactical and one personal. Prior to that tour, everyone had tried to kick like &#91;New Zealand full-back&#93; Don Clarke, who was a legend as far as we were concerned. You ran up to the ball and hoofed it as hard as you could, as he did. Then along came Barry John, the Lions fly-half.' Fitzpatrick recalls the Wales player's unique 'round the corner' kicking style, as he puts it. 'It wasn't just that it was different. It was that it worked so well. After that, it was farewell to Don. I was a huge fan of Gareth Edwards, too. I even bought myself a red jersey so that when my brother and I played in the garden, he would be the All Blacks and I would be the Lions or Wales.'<P>The Lions' victory was a wake-up call to New Zealanders, a reminder that obsession did not necessarily equate to dominance and that the same mistake could not be allowed to recur. No one felt this more acutely than Fitzpatrick himself, as captain in 1993. After going one up in a three-match series against the Lions, the All Blacks surrendered the second Test 20-7, leaving themselves just a week to recover and avoid the fate of the losing 1971 side. 'I said to the Lions captain, Gavin Hastings, almost immediately after the final whistle, "Just you watch how the country turns on the All Blacks". And it did. The week leading up to the series decider was comfortably the worst week of my life. That we won the final Test was entirely down to the fact that we each knew we wouldn't be able to face the country if we lost.'<P>In 1974, the Lions travelled to apartheid South Africa. If New Zealand was the heart of rugby, then South Africa was its muscles and bones, a place where superiority had to be asserted through physical ascendancy. It was 'unmanly' to play any other way. 'I don't think the South Africans had any idea how much British forward play had improved,' recalls Wales's Mervyn Davies, a key member of a pack that absorbed then repelled a series of ferocious Springbok assaults. Grudgingly - and having watched their team lose the four-match Test series 3-0 they had little choice - the native volk conceded their side's inferiority. Far readier to accord respect to the Lions were the black townships, who supported the Lions because they identified them as their 'enemy's enemy'. The bond between the two groups was sealed when a township side became one of the few South African teams to cross the tourists' try line during the tour.<P>In the early seventies, a Lions tour offered the opportunity to play in a country that few of the team had even visited. For those in the southern hemisphere, it afforded a rare glimpse of the best players from the north. Today, the international rugby calendar is cluttered with teams from these islands heading south to play South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. But these are not tours, at least not in the traditional sense. The back-to-back Tests, crammed into an already tight schedule to satisfy the demand of television networks, are over too quickly. The players spend most of their time in hotels and airports.<P>A Lions tour should be and is different. The sportswriter John Hopkins oncedescribed it as 'a cross between a medieval crusade and a prep school outing'. Hopkins was no doubt thinking about the very first tour, to New Zealand in 1888 - a tour that, boat transportation included, lasted eight months. But he could have been writing about the 1971 tour: 26 matches not just in New Zealand but also in Australia (then considered a gentle warm-up), occupying nearly three months. This was when players, locals and journalists would mingle freely. Frank Keating, of the Guardian, has written of how the press of the day would allow the impoverished amateur players use of their hotel phones to call home. Professionalism has changed all that. The players in New Zealand with the Lions have everything they want. They are comfortable and well paid. Many of them have newspaper columns and sponsorship deals. And yet the point about touring is that it is not meant to be easy. As the 1997 Lions assistant coach, Jim Telfer, warned his men: 'It's a bit like when the British and Irish go abroad. The first thing they look for is a pint of Guinness. The second is a plate of fish and chips. The next thing they do is look for another British or Irish person. That won't do for me and it won't do for you.'<P>Four years later, in Australia, this counsel appeared to have been ignored. If the official tour video can be believed, the closest that the 2001 Lions party came to immersing themselves in the wider culture was a few rounds of golf and a trip to the set of Neighbours. There are many reasons why that particular tour broke up in bitter recrimination, but one of them must be the management's unwillingness to allow the players time off, to encourage them to explore the local history and society. Compare that with Steve Waugh's Aussie cricketers who, at the same time, were making their way to England for the Ashes series but stopped off at Gallipoli to pay their respects to their fallen countrymen. Clive Woodward, coach of this year's Lions, seems eager to atone. At the press conference to announce his squad in April, he declared: 'We will be working with the New Zealand authorities to set up a full social programme. We want this set of Lions to be remembered as much for how they conducted themselves off the field as on it.'<P>Woodward may well be pushing at an open door. 'There was outcry when Clive said that his team would be based in Auckland and fly out for any matches further afield,' says Sean Fitzpatrick, who will be commentating on the series for Sky. 'That's why I was delighted when he flew back last Christmas and said that the squad would be travelling around the districts. We want these guys in our community. We want the kids to be able to say they touched them. Lions tours only come to our country every 12 years so it's important that the next generation of rugby players gets a glimpse of them. Just as I was inspired by Gareth Edwards in 1971, there will be kids who will get a huge lift from seeing Jonny Wilkinson or Brian O'Driscoll play or train.'<P>In truth, it will not be the Lions' external profile that most occupies Woodward in the forthcoming weeks - that's where Alastair Campbell, his controversial appointment as communications chief, will be required - but the more difficult task of maintaining internal harmony.<P>A few months ago, I was talking to former Ireland captain Keith Wood, a leading figure on the tours of 1997 and 2001. When I made a casual reference to the British Lions, he immediately interrupted. 'I think you mean the British and Irish Lions,' he said. His intervention was a reminder that bringing together players from four different countries into a cohesive unit in less than two months, which is difficult enough, can be complicated further by politics and national rivalries.<P>It is easy to forget how acute tensions were between the home unions at the turn of the 1990s as the Welsh struggled to come to terms with their own decline and as Scotland and England competed for supremacy. 'You'd have the English in one corner, the Welsh in another, and the Scots and the Irish laughing about how much they were going to drink on tour,' says Scott Hastings, the Scotland centre who was part of the 1989 and 1993 campaigns.<P>It is believed that the decision to award the captaincy of the 1993 tour to Gavin Hastings, instead of Will Carling, was made on the basis that few of the Celts in the party felt comfortable about playing under an English captain. Eight years later, in Australia, it was the turn of the Welsh to assert their tribalism. There is a story that when an English player sat down for breakfast with his team-mates from the Principality, they began to speak in Welsh. Perhaps more difficult for Woodward will be the task of making all 45 members of his party feel integrated and involved when only half can be selected in the Test squad. The Lions coach has said that he does not yet know the identity of the 22 players who will be chosen for the first Test squad. We should take him at his word. But there will come a point - no later than a fortnight hence - when the likely make-up of that starting squad will emerge. It is then that his powers of conciliation will be most tested.<P>It is not clear when the term 'dirt-tracker' first surfaced, but it was popularised on the last Lions tour to New Zealand in 1993, when a rump of between 10 and 12 players were left feeling redundant and disillusioned. 'I think one of the saddest sights I've ever seen in rugby,' former England and Lions hooker Brian Moore says, 'was that of the midweek team being led off for a swim by one of the management while the Test team went through a private training session.' The performances of the midweek side in the games that preceded the second and third Tests were among the poorest in the Lions' proud history. Stuart Barnes, captain of the 'dirt-trackers', could not hide his disgust: 'I could never contemplate giving up like some of them did. I feel humiliated. It just didn't mean enough for some of our team to play for the Lions.'<P>And yet the dirt trackers can help bolster morale. Never was this more apparent than in Australia in 1989. 'It was that midweek team that kept the tour on track,' says Ieuan Evans, the former Wales wing and a veteran of three tours. 'We had taken a hammering in the first Test and the way they went out and performed straight afterwards lifted everyone. They were called Donal's Donuts &#91;after captain Donal Lenihan&#93;, but there was nothing soft about them.' From there, the Lions won the second and third Tests to become the only side to win a series after losing the opening match.<P>Among the various battles that make the forthcoming series so exciting is that between the rival coaches: Clive Woodward, the World Cup-winner eager to enjoy one final honour in rugby before turning to football, against Graham Henry, the New Zealander who was in charge of Wales then picked to coach the Lions on that difficult and fractious 2001 tour of Australia. Henry was the first 'foreigner' to coach the Lions and there was the inevitable backlash, even from within his own camp.<P>'That was one of the toughest periods of my life, no doubt about it,' Henry told me in Auckland in March. 'I had barely given a moment's thought to the Lions job in the 2000-01 season because I didn't think they would pick an overseas coach. When my appointment was confirmed, there were quite a few former Lions queuing up to say what a bad move it was. That was understandable. I didn't mind. I just felt humbled and privileged to have the job.'<P>None of this would have mattered had he returned home victorious from Australia. He did not. After a wonderful win in the first Test in Melbourne, the Lions were soundly defeated by the Wallabies in the following game and narrowly lost the deciding match. 'Maybe because I was an outsider, it made me an easy target when we lost the series.' Yet even if Henry had won the series, there are grounds for believing that he would still have been a target. It is well documented that a cluster of squad members disliked him and his methods. Both in and outside the camp, there was a widespread feeling that the coach had already decided on his Test team even before the squad had departed for Australia. As in New Zealand in 1993, those who believed that they were surplus to requirements soon dissolved into truculent discontent.<P>The very public spokesmen of this fifth column were Matt Dawson and Austin Healey. Both Englishmen could start a fight in an empty house so the New Zealander could have shrugged off their criticisms. More problematic for Henry were the reservations of England and Lions captain Martin Johnson, who would later write in his autobiography: 'If the management had decided to send Matt &#91;Dawson&#93; home, I would have been on the plane next to him and so would a lot of the other guys.' It was hardly an endorsement of Henry's leadership.<P>The contrast between Henry and Woodward could not be more marked. The former England coach is the business entrepreneur, ever willing to look beyond rugby for new ideas and to experiment with technology, management consultants and the military to achieve a competitive edge. Henry is a former headmaster and the absence of a corporate background in his CV is thought to have cost him his first chance of coaching the All Blacks when, in 1995, the game turned professional. He distrusts journalists and can often appear guarded and surly. It is impossible to imagine him employing Alastair Campbell, for example, as Woodward has done.<P>Yet he seems more relaxed now, possibly because he is back among his own and because he finally has the job that he always coveted and few dispute his right to hold. If there is a general indictment of Henry's regime with the Lions, however, it is that he overworked his players. Jason Robinson and Keith Wood both told me that the relentless training sessions imposed by the management exhausted a squad already weakened with injury. An opposing view is voiced by current acting England captain, Martin Corry. 'I wouldn't necessarily agree that we were overworked,' he says. 'You have to remember that you've got players from four different nations, all used to playing in different attacking and defensive systems. The only way you can mould them together in one uniform style in such a short space of time is to put in the hours on the training pitch. If I had to summarise the problem with that tour, it was that the players didn't see it through the management's eyes and vice-versa.'<P>Corry is a useful point of reference because, despite only making it on to the tour as an injury replacement and being marked down as a dirt-tracker, he worked his way into the Test team. 'I only arrived out in Australia at the end of the first week of the tour but I soon sensed the tension in the squad,' he recalls. 'The problem was that the coaches placed so much emphasis on winning the Tests. We could have lost all the provincial games and won the Test series 2-1 and that would have been a good tour as far as they were concerned. When you make such a stark distinction, then the guys who aren't in the Test side will inevitably start to feel like secondary citizens. Unfortunately, it only takes one player to complain for the whole negative vibe to start to spread. I think you'll find that a lot of the guys who felt unhappy were those who had been on the 1997 tour in South Africa, which was successful. I had nothing to compare it with so I was just happy to be there.'<P>Henry is at least prepared to acknowledge Corry's point, albeit obliquely: 'I concentrated on winning rather than individuals. That tour was the biggest learning curve of my career.' Yet the sour note on which that experience ended has been replaced by a renewed relish. 'This is the biggest rugby, no, sporting event we have had in this country since the 1987 World Cup,' he says now. 'It should be the ambition of every southern-hemisphere player to face the Lions. None of our guys has ever faced them before and with the Lions not coming to New Zealand again for another 12 years, they probably won't get a second chance. So you would hope that everyone would be busting a gut to make this team and to do the same once they're in.' It is an intimidating prospect. Yet you know that Clive Woodward would not want it to be any other way.<P><b>&#183; </b>Nick Greenslade is assistant editor of Observer Sport Monthly<P><b>Match dates</b><P>4 June v Bay of Plenty, International Stadium, Rotorua<P>8 June v Taranaki, Yarrow Stadium, New Plymouth<P>11 June v New Zealand Maori, Waikato Stadium, Hamilton<P>15 June v Wellington, Westpac Stadium<P>18 June v Otago, Carisbrook, Dunedin<P>21 June v Southland, Rugby Park Stadium, Invercargill<P>25 June v New Zealand, Jade Stadium, Christchurch<br><b>first test</b><P>28 June v Manawatu, Arena Manawatu, Palmerston North<P>2 July v New Zealand, Westpac Stadium, Wellington <br><b>second test</b><P>5 July v Auckland, Eden Park<P>9 July v New Zealand, Eden Park, Auckland<br><b>third test</b><P>All matches kick off at 0810 BST and are shown on Sky Sports<P>Twenty thousand Lions supporters will travel to New Zealand.
