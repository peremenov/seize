<div id="Content">
<p>
<span class="storyheadline">Are You A Representative of USC's Athletics Interest?</span>
<P>You are a representative of USC's athletics interests (commonly known as a "booster") if you have made a donation to the USC Athletic Department, are or have been a member of a booster organization associated with USC Athletics, or you have been involved in any way with promoting USC's athletic programs.
<P>Once an individual is identified as an Athletics Representative, the person retains that identity forever!
<p>
<span class="storyheadline">Who Is A Prospect?</span>
<P>A prospect is a student in the ninth grade and above, including students in prep schools, junior colleges, and individuals who have officially withdrawn from four-year schools. In addition, a student who has not yet started ninth grade may become a prospect if USC or a booster provides the student, or the student's relatives or friends, with financial assistance or benefits not generally provided to other students.
<p>
<span class="storyheadline">What Is Recruiting?</span>
<P>Recruiting is any solicitation of a prospect or the prospect's parent/legal guardian by a University staff member for the purpose of securing the prospect's enrollment at USC and/or participation in USC's intercollegiate athletics program.
<P>Recruiting activities include correspondence, e-mail, faxes, telephone conversations and in-person contacts (both on and off campus).
<p>
<span class="storyheadline">Who May Recruit?</span>
<P>Only coaches and Athletic Department staff may be involved in the recruiting process. The NCAA rules specifically prohibit boosters from engaging in recruiting activities. 
<P>You may not have any contact (i.e., in-person encounter, telephone call, correspondence) with a prospect or the prospect's family, on or off campus. If a prospect approaches you regarding USC, explain that NCAA rules prevent you from discussing USC with prospects. This prohibition also applies to prospects making official visits to USC.
<P>You may not contact a prospect's coach, principal or counselor for the purpose of evaluating a prospect's athletic ability or academic record.
<P>You may not talk to a student-athlete at another institution for the purpose of encouraging him or her to transfer to USC.
<p>
<span class="storyheadline">What May Boosters Do?</span>
<P>You may continue to have contact with an established family friend or neighbor who is a prospect.  However, such contact may not be for recruiting purposes and may not be initiated by a USC coaching staff member.
<P>You may bring outstanding prospects to the attention of the USC coaching staff by sending them newspaper clippings or other information about prospects. However, you may not be involved in the actual evaluation of talent. All evaluations and contacts are the sole responsibility of the USC coaching staff.
<P>You may offer assistance to members of USC's coaching staff who are recruiting in your community.
<p>
<span class="storyheadline">Common Questions</span>
<P><B>Q: The son or daughter of an old friend is being actively recruited by a USC coach. Do I have to stop having any contact with the prospect and his or her parents?</B></font>
<P>A: No, you may continue to enjoy the same relationship with the family that you had before. You may not, however, use your relationship to urge that the son or daughter chooses USC, and you may not allow a coach to enlist you in the recruitment process.
<P><B>Q: What should I do if I encounter a prospect while watching my son or daughter's high school athletic contest?</B></font>
<P>A: The NCAA rules prohibit boosters from having in-person contacts with prospects.   However, the rules recognize that a booster may inadvertently (without prearrangement) come into contact with a prospect. In this situation, the booster may exchange polite greetings with the prospect, but must then terminate the encounter.  The exception does NOT apply if the contact occurs at the prospect's school, or at a site where the prospect is competing. In these circumstances, NO contact of any kind is permitted.
<P><B>Q: May I attend a public event - for example; a community picnic or a high school banquet or awards dinner - if prospects are also in attendance?</B></font>
<P>A: Yes, you may. Be sure, though, that you do not have any contact with the prospects.

<span class="storyheadline">What Is An Extra Benefit?</span>
<P>An extra benefit is any special arrangement to provide a student-athlete or the student-athlete's relatives or friends with a benefit not authorized by the NCAA rules. The NCAA allows USC to provide student-athletes with scholarships to cover tuition, fees, room, board and books. We can also provide complimentary admissions to USC athletic events, practice or competition-related apparel, equipment and medical treatment. It is a violation of NCAA rules for a student-athlete to receive any other benefit UNLESS the same benefit is normally available to all USC students or their parents/guardians.

<span class="storyheadline">Examples of Extra Benefits a Booster Cannot Provide:</span>
<ul>
<li>  Cash
<li>  Arranging, providing or co-signing a loan
<li>   Providing any kind of transportation or the use of a car
<li>   Tickets to collegiate, professional or any sporting event.
<li>   Gifts of food, clothing or equipment
<li>   Arranging or providing free or reduced cost telephone services, housing or professional services
<li>   Arranging or providing employment for a student-athlete's parents, guardians or friends
</ul>
<p>
<span class="storyheadline">What May A Booster Provide? </span>
<P>You may provide an "occasional" meal at your home for a student-athlete or an entire team if you live within a 30-mile radius of USC's main campus. You may also provide transportation to your home for the meal. The term "occasional" has been interpreted to be no more than once per year.
<P>You may provide a job to prospects that have signed a letter of intent to attend USC. For addition you may employ an enrolled student-athlete under certain circumstances with prior approval from the USC Athletic Department. Student-athletes who are not freshmen may receive employment income in certain situations. Both the student-athlete and the employer must sign a written statement PRIOR to beginning any employment during the academic year. Student-athletes may be compensated only for work actually performed and at a rate commensurate with the going rate in the area for similar services. The general limit on employment earnings that do not count towards NCAA limits is $2,000 annually, not including official vacation periods.
<p>
<span class="storyheadline">Common Questions</span>
<P><B>Q: May I give a discount on clothing, food or car rentals to student-athletes as part of my business?</B></font>
<P>A: No. A discount that is specifically designed for student-athletes is considered an extra benefit and against NCAA rules. However, if you provide a discount to all USC students or the general public, then student-athletes can also receive the discount.
<P><B>Q: May I loan my car to the parents of a student-athlete who are in town visiting their son or daughter?</B></font>
<P>A: No. The NCAA's prohibition on extra benefits for student-athletes also applies to their relatives and friends.
<p>
<span class="storyheadline">What Can You Do?</span>
<P>If you know of a high school student-athlete who might want to attend the University of Southern California, the only permissible activity for a representative is to call the appropriate coach.
