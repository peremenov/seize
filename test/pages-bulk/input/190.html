<p>This document outlines the basic principles underlying the proper use
of the optical radiation safety calculator. It is designed for assessing
situations in which the eye is illuminated, either to provide a stimulus
or to illuminate it for photography, videography or direct observation.
The optical radiation safety calculator performs calculations for radiation
at visible wavelengths (400-700 nm), and near infrared (700-1400 nm).

<p><font size=+2>1.&nbsp;<a NAME="radiometry"></a>Radiometry basics</font>
<p>The basic principles of radiometry can be found elsewhere (link to W&amp;S
ref), but will be presented here in brief. Measurements can be made either
in terms of radiometric units, which correspond to raw energy or power,
or photometric units, which are corrected for visibility. When dealing
with safety issues, we are primarily concerned with radiometric measures;
the same principles apply to photometric measurements, however, so when
we use a radiometric term, the corresponding photometric term will be listed
in parentheses.

<p>The basic radiometric (photometric) measurements are irradiance (illuminance)
and radiance (luminance). Irradiance describes the total power falling
on a surface (such as the surface of a detector, or a tissue surface in
the eye). The units of irradiance are expressed in power per unit area,
typically Watts per centimeter squared (W/cm&#178;).

<p>When a surface is irradiated with a certain amount of power, the energy
comes from a source. Most sources are distributed in space, that is, they
have some finite size. (This size approaches zero for a perfectly collimated
beam, such as might be emitted by a laser.) The radiance of a source is
simply the irradiance it produces, divided by the size of the source, where
the size is expressed as the solid angle (in steradians) subtended by the
source from the point at which the measurement is made. A little reflection
should make it clear that the radiance of a source is independent of the
distance at which the measurement is made: if we double the distance from
the source, the irradiance will decrease by a factor of 4 (inverse square
law); but the apparent size of the source will also decrease by a factor
of 4, and the two factors cancel out.

<p><font size=+2>2.&nbsp;<a NAME="ocular"></a>Types of ocular exposure</font>

<p>For considerations of eye safety, there are two principle areas of concern:
the first is corneal irradiance. When optical radiation (particularly infrared)
strikes the cornea, it can heat and dry it, causing damage to the tissue.
(Infrared radiation can also cause damage to soft contact lenses at levels
that are considered safe for eye exposure, but to my knowledge there is
no published data on this!)

<p>The second area of concern is retinal irradiation. Damage to the retina
can cause areas of local blindness ("scotomas"). The calculation of retinal
irradiance is fairly straightforward: the total amount of power entering
the eye can be calculated as the product of the corneal irradiance times
the <a href="#pupArea">effective pupil area</a>. The illuminated area of
retina will be an image of the source, subtending the same angle from the
posterior nodal point as the source does from the anterior nodal point.
Therefore, the retinal area is simply the product of the solid angle subtended
by the source (in steradians) and the posterior nodal distance of the eye.

<p>To convert retinal irradiance to radiance, we need to divide by the
source solid angle; but at the retina, the apparent source is the exit
pupil of the eye, so this is the relevant measure. It can be shown by a
little algebra that this is identically equal to the original source radiance!

<p>For the calculations we assume that the source is uniform. This assumption
may be violated for real sources; for example, a lamp filament will have
"hot spots" where the local radiance is higher than the average radiance.
In these situations, it is best to use a diffuser to homogenize the source
image. Diffractive optical elements capable of diffusing a beam within
a narrow angular range (such as those manufactured by Physical Optics Corporation)
are ideal for this application.

<p><a NAME="anchordetDiam"></a><b>Detector diameter.</b>
<br>A circular detector area is assumed. For a circular detector, simply
enter the diameter in millimeters of the active surface. For a non-circular
detector, calculate the area (in mm&#178), then divide by pi (3.14159), take
the square root of the result and multiply by 2 to obtain the equivalent
diameter.

<p><a NAME="anchorwavelength"></a><b>Wavelength</b>
<br>A monochromatic or narrow band source is assumed. For a broadband infrared
source, the value here is not too critical, because the calculations are
not too wavelength dependent. To be conservative, use a value of xxx nm.
Broadband visible sources are more problematic, because the "blue light
hazard" function has a sharp peak at 4xx nm.

<p><a NAME="anchorpupil"></a><b>Source dimensions at pupil</b>
<br>These parameters are most relevant for setups (such as Maxwellian view
optical systems) where the source is imaged in the pupil by a system of
one or more lenses. In the case where the source image is smaller than
the natural pupil (assumed to be 7 mm), the source area is used for the
<a href="#pupArea">effective pupil area</a>. For cases where the entire
eye/face is illuminated directly by a source, the values here do not really
matter, as long as they are larger than 7mm.

<p><a NAME="anchordistance"></a><b>Apparent size and distance of the source</b>
<br>For free viewing of a source, simply enter the actual size and distance
(in millimeters). For Maxwellian view, where the final lens appears uniformly
filled with light, use the diameter and distance of the lens.

<p><a NAME="anchordetPower"></a><b>Detector power</b>
<br>Enter the power measurement in microwatts.

<p><a NAME="pupArea"></a><b>Effective pupil area:</b> The area of the pupil
through which light passes. Under free viewing conditions, this is usually
just the area of the natural pupil. It can be smaller than the natural
pupil under special conditions, such as viewing through a small artificial
pupil, or when using an instrument with a small exit pupil such as a Maxwellian
view optical system.
