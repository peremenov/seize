<p><font face="Book Antiqua">While researching the origins of the Religious
Right for this series, we came across an obscure but significant passage
in an obscure but highly significant document titled "The Belmont Brotherhood".
This report is an expose of the John Birch Society, whose founding members
were discovered to be, in the main, high-ranking Freemasons and members
of other subversive organizations. The authors intended to develop the
Belmont report into a book, but did not do so for reasons that remain unknown
but should become apparent to the reader upon discovery of the various
connections of the JBS founders. Since the John Birch Society successfully
laid the foundation for the exploitation of Christians through the ultra-conservative
movement, the Belmont Brotherhood is must reading for every Christian:
<a HREF="belmont.html">http://watch-unto-prayer.org/belmont.html</a></font>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua">The passage which intrigued us is found under
section #5 -- a profile of former JBS National Councilman, J. Nelson Shepherd,
who belonged to the very elite Newcomen Society. This mysterious society
was to be exposed by authors of The Belmont Brotherhood in their book which
never materialized, and there is scant information available elsewhere.
The president of the Newcomen Society for some length of time was Charles
Penrose, Jr. who was also a member of two high-level, subversive and one-world
societies in the U.S. known as the <a HREF="pilgrim.html">Pilgrim
Society and the English-Speaking Union</a>.&nbsp; We have already posted
two reports by Eric Samuelson about these societies, which have their origins
in the Cecil Rhodes-Milner Round Table Group of Great Britain, which purpose
was to reestablish the British Commonwealth of Nations and, ultimately,
to bring the world under the domination of a restored British Empire.</font>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua">What Cecil Rhodes and Alfred Milner had in
mind was the formation of a master/slave society based upon the principles
of eugenics as derived from Plato's Republic.
<a HREF="../www.connectcorp.net/~trufax/menu/mind.html">Malthusian
Eugenics</a> is the philosophy of depopulation through the reduction of
inferior races --"human weeds"-- and the selective breeding of "a race
of thoroughbreds" as described early in this century by Rockefeller-funded,
Planned Parenthood founder, Margaret Sanger. When Thomas Malthus' theory
of population was later coupled with Charles Darwin's evolutionary model,
the result was known as Social Darwinism.</font>
<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">The combination of Malthusian population
control, which included the </font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">deliberate
neglect of populations and indirect methods of killing off population</font></i><font face="Book Antiqua">,
with Darwinism, produced National Socialism (Germany), International Socialism
(Marxist Russia) and International Corporate Capitalism (Global Socialism,
headquartered in the United States), and these forms of social conduct
have constituted the main reason for the unequal distribution of planetary
resources, famines, planned biological warefare, environmental poisoning,
suppression of knowledge, suppression of inventions, dependence on backward
technology for the population, planned wars to kill off populations and
general planetary disorder. The problem is in the Social Darwin-Malthus
paradigm, which has now been combined with the pseudo-sciences of behaviorism
and genetics in the attempt to assert even tighter control over the planetary
population, yielding forms of Neo-Darwinism being perpetrated by a host
of post-Atlantean re-treads, per a 1947 Princeton consensus.</font></blockquote>
<font face="Book Antiqua">Malthusian eugenics has long captivated the imaginations
of the very elite who control the world's wealth and power structures.
Nearly two centuries of applied principles of Social Darwinism have positioned
the world whereby the empowered elite classes may govern the slave race
they create to labor under their monopolist capitalist rule. Since the
Orders of Freemasonry largely comprise the ruling elite which owns the
transnational corporations, a Masonic history of <a HREF="../www.bgw.net/sites/conspiracy/masonry/006.htm">The
Round Table</a> is instructive:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">Throughout most the ninetieth century,
French Freemasonry, and not English Freemasonry, was the dominant revolutionary
force in the Old World - offering the lower and middle classes a voice
in government. Since its beginning in 1717, the British Brotherhood was
aristocratic, capitalist, and monopolistic.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">When French Grand Orient Freemasonry
sent a German-born Mason, Karl Marx (1818 - 1883) to England to agitate
the lower classes to rebel against the British aristocracy, the British
aristocracy became concerned. To counter the increasingly influential ideology
of French Freemasonry, in 1870 a select group of English Masonry devised
a plan which would both satisfy the proletariat and keep the Masonic oligarchy
in power. The scheme was introduced at Oxford, by Freemason John Ruskin.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">Ruskin's inspiration and devotion
to the creation of an elite of race patriots derived directly from Plato's
Republic. In the Republic, Plato called for "a ruling class with a powerful
army to keep it in power and a society completely subordinate to the monolithic
authority of the rulers." Ruskin sent out to recoup and extend the influence
of British Masonry. He wanted to do this by education of the working man.
His views on the ruling class as developed from Plato's Republic, sent
shock waves through Oxford.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">"[You, the undergraduates are] the
possessors of a magnificent tradition of education, beauty, rule of law,
freedom, decency and self-discipline but... this tradition [can] not be
saved, and does not deserve to be saved, unless it can be extended to the
lower classes in England itself and to the non-English masses throughout
the world. If this precious tradition is not extended to these two great
majorities, the minority of upper-class Englishmen will ultimately be submerged
by these majorities and the tradition lost. To prevent this, the tradition
must be extended to the masses and to the empire."</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">Ruskin's rationale for proclaiming
such ideas was to plant in the fertile minds of his Oxford students the
theory that if they educated the working man and elevated him to the middle
class, he would labor in behalf of the aristocracy to perpetuate the tradition
of the upper-class Englishmen - which tradition was to control the finances
of nations through ground rent, banking and trade. Ruskin taught that it
was the essential duty of the aristocracy to guarantee an education for
the so that an expanded middle class would rule the country. This arrangement
would be a type of legal slavery whereby both classes would benefit. Through
the power of finance, the ruling class would maintain control from behind
the scenes, while the working class would have opportunity to share in
the common wealth made available through loans.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">Ruskin successfully transmitted his
vision
to his students at Oxford. They in turn became the Masonic movers and shakers
in the new politics and economics that today govern the seven industrial
nations of the world - the United States, Canada, England, Germany, France,
Italy, and Japan.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">A wealthy young man, Cecil Rhodes,
like John Ruskin believed that only the British elite could and should
rule the world to the benefit and happiness of mankind. Shortly after arriving
at Oxford, Rhodes was initiated into Freemasonry at the Apollo University
lodge No. 357. On April 17, 1877, he was raised a Master Mason in the same
lodge. Rhodes also joined a Scottish Rite Lodge at Oxford called Prince
Rose Croix Lodge No. 30.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">What sort of character was Cecil
Rhodes? Rhodes was a critic of English Freemasonry - of its impotence and
incompetence in advancing British race interest. After being raised to
Master Mason on April 17, 1877, Rhodes drafted a program for world dominion
by the British race patriots. To guarantee the funding from his vast wealth
of his world vision for the British empire, Rhodes wrote in 1877 the first
of seven wills that he composed over his lifetime. The first will called
for the formation of a "secret society" whose primary function would be
focused on returning England to her former glory. He viewed English Freemasonry
and its conspiracy as impotent and in effect defunct in this regard. Ironically,
when the society Rhodes had envisioned was finally organized after his
death, its membership consisted only of English Freemasons. "The Round
Table," as it was known, soon became the most powerful appendage of the
British Brotherhood.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">In his third will Rhodes left his
entire estate to Freemason Lord Nathan Rothschild as trustee. Rhodes stipulated
that his gigantic fortune be used by his disciples to carry out the program
he envisioned. Rothschild appointed Freemason Alfred Milner to head up
the Secret society for which Rhodes's first will made provision. Lord Milner
once remarked of himself, "My patriotism knows no geographical but only
racial limits. I am a British Race patriot."</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">Upon his appointment by Rothschild
to chair Rhodes's secret society, Milner recruited a group of young men
from Oxford and Tonybee Hall to assist him in organizing his administration
of the new society. All were respected English Freemasons. Among them were
Rudyard Kipling, Arthur Balfour, Lord Rothschild, and some Oxford College
graduates known as "Milner's Kindergarten." In 1909, Milner's Kindergarten,
with some other English Masons, founded the Round Table. The grandfather
of all modern British Masonic "think tanks" was born.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">Three powerful think tank offshoots
of the Round Table are (1) the Royal Institute of International Affairs
(RIIA), organized in 1919 in London; (2) the Council on Foreign Relations
(CFR), organized in 1921 in New York City; and (3) the Institute of Pacific
Relations (IPR), organized in 1925 or the twelve countries holding territory
in what today we call the Pacific Rim.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">The initial assignment of the Round
Table was not necessarily to destroy the political experiments of French
Freemasonry, such as socialism and communism, but to cooperate with them
for the advancement of the English Masonic conspiracy.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">Some seven years before the organization
of the Round Table, of which H.G. Wells would be a founding member, Wells
explained the strategy by which aristocratic English Freemasonry would
reach its goal of world dominion. He called it an "Open Conspiracy" as
opposed to French Freemasonry's closed or secret conspiracy.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">"The Open Conspiracy will appear
first, I believe, as a conscious organization of intelligent and quite
possibly in some cases wealthy men, as a movement having distinct social
and political aims . . ."</font></blockquote>
<font face="Book Antiqua">H.G. Wells, previously a member of the socialist
Fabian Society of England, was, according to the MacKenzies' history of
</font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The
Fabians</font></i><font face="Book Antiqua">, "branching out into speculations
about a new social order..." <font size=+0 color="#000000">An elite
group of Twelve Wise Men, which included [Bertrand] Russell and Wells,
were selected as the "Co-Efficients" who met to discuss and formulate,
"Ideas about racial improvement by selecting out the efficient...and [George
Bernard] Shaw was working on these 'eugenic' notions in his new play <i>Man
and Superman</i>. [Fabian and Co-Efficients co-founder] Beatrice Webb called
it 'the most important of all questions, the breeding of the right sort
of man...'</font></font>
<blockquote><font size=+0 color="#000000"><font face="Book Antiqua">"Above
all they were avowed elitists, intolerant of the cumbersome and apparently
wasteful processes of democracy, who wanted to see England ruled by a superior
caste which matched an enlightened sense of duty with a competence to govern
effectively. All of them, moreover, shared Sidney [Webb]'s belief -- which
had led him to spend so much effort on London education and on the School
of Economics -- that social improvement depended upon the training of the
superior manpower needed to carry out schemes of reform. Shaw was suggesting
in his latest play that universal suffrage was a disaster, putting power
in the hands of the 'riff-raff' and... Webb who could not wait until a
new race of supermen had been bred up to establish the millennium, felt
that improved education and intelligent politics would at least start the
necessary process of regeneration." (Mackenzie, </font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The
Fabians</font></i><font face="Book Antiqua">, pp. 283, 290-1)</font></font></blockquote>

of the American Round Table, who in 1953 subverted a Special Committee
to Investigate Tax-Exempt Foundations chaired by Congressman Carroll Reece
of Tennessee. According to a series of articles in the Chicago Tribune
in 1951, there was a time, prior to the Cold War, when a measure of concern
was growing over the shadow cast upon the American government by the British
Rhodes-Milner Round Table. The following several excerpts from the Chicago
Tribune were cited in an anonymously authored book, <a HREF="../www.ourhero.com/library/books/UnionJack-JewishConspiracyInEngland/uj-02.html">The
Union Jack</a>:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">Why is it so easy for Americans to
be confused about the source of Communism? And why can Americans not believe
that the British Empire is more powerful today than ever in history? Do
they think that Rhodes Scholar internationalists who have key positions
in United States institutions and government are made in Russia? Certainly
they come from Oxford, England. In the year 1951 there were some interesting
articles printed by the Chicago Tribune on Rhodes Scholars. The Tribune
of course would not do so again nor would any big newspaper. Instead they
have all been assigned the job of playing down the importance and strength
of the British Empire.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">In the July 15, 1951 article in the
Tribune entitled "Rhodes Ideals Slant State Dept. Policies," subtitled
"Key Posts Held by Oxford Scholars," by William Fulton, we quote:</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">"New York, July 15 - Key positions
in the United States department of state are held by a network of American
Rhodes scholars. Rhodes scholars are men who obtained supplemental education
and indoctrination at Oxford University in England with the bills paid
by the estate of Cecil John Rhodes, British empire builder. Rhodes wrote
about his ambition to cause 'the ultimate recovery of the United States
of America as an integral part of the British empire.' The late diamond
and gold mining tycoon aimed at a world federation dominated by Anglo-Saxons.
His intimates have admitted the scholarships were established for the primary
purpose of instilling 'political Bias' rather than providing education."
End quote.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">Then on July 16, 1951, under the
title "Rhodes' Ideas Find Fertile Ground in U. N." subtitled " 'Scholars'
Advance British Schemes," by William Fulton, we quote:</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">"New York, July 16 - American Rhodes
scholars, men who have received education and indoctrination at Oxford
University, England,- are prominent in the affairs of the United Nations.
The U.N. is an outgrowth of schemes developed by the scholars' patron,
Cecil Rhodes, the British empire builder. Rhodes dreamed of an Anglo-Saxon
federation with the British dominating, an organization powerful enough
to police the world and preserve the peace. In his writings the diamond
despot of South Africa showed he hoped the scholarships would promote his
grandiose idea. Thirty-two American collegians go to Oxford each year under
terms of Rhodes' will." End quote.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">On July 17, 1951, under the title
"Scholars Help British Cash In On U.S. Billions," subtitled "Rhodes Men
Hold Key Dole Jobs," by William Fulton, we quote:</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">"New York, July 17-'Diamonds are
a girl's best friend,' the popular song goes, and diamonds also are a Rhodes
scholar's best friend. Approximately 1,400 Americans have gone to Oxford
University, England, since 1904 with the way paid from the estate of Cecil
Rhodes, diamond magnate and British empire builder. Today numerous Rhodes
scholars are in a position to repay their educational benefactor in dollars
for the sparklers dug up in their behalf from the diamond lands seized
by the British in South Africa during the last century.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">"Rhodes scholars dominate the United
States department of state, which directs the doling out of billions in
foreign aid, with the United Kingdom getting the major share. The savants
also hold down important positions in the economic cooperation administration,
mutual defense assistance program, and other foreign handout setups. This
is all in keeping with Rhodes' overweening ambitions for a world federation
dominated by Anglo-Saxons for the purpose of enforcing peace and the status
quo. He also aimed at 'the ultimate recovery of the United States of America
as an integral part of the British Empire.' With the Oxford-indoctrinated
Rhodes scholars holding key positions in the Washington administration,
Britain obtained 31 billion dollars from Uncle Sam in the form of 'lend
lease' outlays during the war. That was followed by the 3.75 billion dollar
'gift loan' to Britain in 1946.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">During the first three years of the
Marshall plan ECA largesse, the United Kingdom received 2 billion 706 million
dollars, by far the largest allotment. A bill providing 8% billion dollars
for the military and economic aid program abroad is pending before congress."

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">On July 19, 1951, in the Tribune
under the title "Rhodes' Wards Hawk Global Scheme In U.S.," subtitled "Peddle
Propaganda for 'One World," by William Fulton, we quote:</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">"New York, July l9 - Rhodes scholars,
returning from schooling and indoctrination at Oxford university, England,
are the principal hawkers of globalist propaganda in the United States.
The American scholars obtain their education abroad through terms of the
will left by the late Cecil Rhodes, British empire builder and South African
despot. Rhodes aimed at the return of the United States to the British
empire and a world federation dominated by Anglo-Saxons. He hoped his scholars
would be instilled with 'political bias' toward these ends, according to
his intimate friends.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">"Previous articles in this series
have disclosed that many of the 1,185 living American Rhodes scholars have
obtained key positions in the state department, the United Nations, the
economic cooperation administration, the mutual defense assistance program,
and other government agencies where they have worked toward fulfillment
of the schemes of their imperial patron." End quote.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">On July 20, 1951, under the title
"Rhodes' Wards Head Global Foundations," subtitled "Dole Out Cash for One
Worlders," by William Fulton, we quote:</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">"New York, July 20 - American Rhodes
scholars, who are spoon-fed doses of internationalism a la mode British
imperialism at Oxford University, England, are prominent back home in the
affairs of the big foundations doling out funds toward globalist schemes
and one world propaganda. Higher echelon offices in Carnegie, Rockefeller
and other privately-endowed foundations are held by Rhodes scholars. This
is in keeping with the aims of the late Cecil Rhodes, British empire builder.
He left his fortune for the conversion of scholars who would promote his
dream of an Anglo-Saxon federation to dominate the world. In this way Rhodes
hoped to return the United States to the empire.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">"So far the Rhodes will has underwritten
the education and indoctrination of 1,400 Americans at the English university
since 1904. The annual output is 32. They have fastened onto key positions
in the state department and other governmental agencies, just as Rhodes
hoped it would happen.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">Funds Further U.N.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">"Both-the Carnegie and Rockefeller
institutions have contributed heavily toward 'international' studies to
further the United Nations and other supra-governmental plans designed
at chipping away American sovereignty. They have also financed organizations
and students which according to congressional sources, smack of communism,
in itself a form of internationalism.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">"The foundations have been the big
moneybags for globalist propaganda through the Woodrow Wilson Foundation,
World Peace Foundation, Foreign Policy Association, Council on Foreign
Relations, and Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Former president
for the last-named, it will be recalled, was Alger Hiss, the state department
adviser for Roosevelt at the Yalta conference. Hiss is now serving sentence
in a federal prison for perjury involving war time espionage for the Russians.</font></blockquote>

"Rhodes Grads Influential In Eastern Press," subtitled "Aid British, Global
Propaganda," by William Fulton, we quote:</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">"New York, July 21 The picture of
the American Rhodes scholars network in the United States - a rabid movement
toward internationalism - is completed and glued together by their numbers
in the field of molding public opinion. They are highly influential in
the eastern press, magazines and radio chains.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">"Rhodes scholars in this country
represent 32 campus leaders carefully selected each year to go to Oxford
University, England, for supplemental schooling. Their patron, the late
Cecil Rhodes, British empire builder and diamond tycoon, aimed at instilling
in his prot&eacute;g&eacute;s 'political bias' rather than education, according
to his intimates.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">"This bias, as revealed by the Rhodes
seven wills and writings, was to recover the United States for the British
empire in the form of an Anglo-Saxon federation. The federation would be
powerful enough to dominate the world and enforce the 'peace.'</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">"Time Follows Rhodes' Line</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">"Closely following the Rhodes' line
of propaganda is the Time, Inc., magazine group headed by Henry Luce. Luce
was not a Rhodes scholar but he did spend a year at Oxford where he sponged
up some of the imperialistic doctrines carried later in his magazines.
Several of his top brass editors have been Rhodes Scholars.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">"From the start Luce followed the
Anglophile trail, whooping it up for American intervention in war when
the British were in trouble and damning pro-Americans as 'isolationists.'
He is a charter member of the 'Eisenhower-for-President' cult, favors entrapment
of Republicans by Truman's so-called bipartisan foreign policy, and the
Marshall plan, which has paid off his magazines.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">"In addition to pushing the British
concept of policing the world with American soldiers and economic aid,
the Luce publications have been infiltrated by another form of globalism.
Whittaker Chambers, devotee of world communism and confessed courier for
a soviet spy ring, was a senior editor ($30,000 a year) for Time magazine.
Chambers informed on Alger Hiss, Roosevelt adviser at Yalta. Hiss is now
in a federal penitentiary for perjury in a case involving soviet espionage.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">"Rhodes Men on N. Y. Times</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">"The New York Times, which has been
pro-British since the first World war, also has its share of Rhodes scholars
on the staff. An interesting footnote in journalistic history is that at
the time Rhodes' final will was published in 1902, the New York Times condemned
the idea of American scholarships.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">"'Why should an American youth go
to Oxford when he can get a better education at home in respect of those
attainments which chiefly make for national greatness?' inquired the Times
in 1902." End quote.</font></blockquote>
<font face="Book Antiqua">It is characteristic of those who take power
by conquest rather than honest means, to seek first to contain and control
their opposition. Wordworth called it, "The simple plan, That they should
take who have the power, And they should keep who can." Lest Americans
begin to suspect the infiltration and gradual takeover of their government
by the subculture of international Freemasonry, another enemy was created.

identifies their technique of diverting suspicion from British Communism,
courtesy of the Freemasons, by leading a crusade against Soviet Communism
-- which, having served its purpose, is now defunct:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">Can anyone deny the widespread influence,
or should we say control, by Rhodes scholars over America? This is in truth
the "iron curtain over America" that is undermining American sovereignty.
Do the paid patriots inform us about British Communism via Rhodes Scholars?</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">Do the "patriots" tell Americans
about Masonic Communism? Do they think that Masonry was made in Moscow?
Certainly not! It was made in England and every Masonic politician and
federal judge in America has given allegiance to Masonry over the United
States Constitution. They cannot be Americans and true to the global scheme
of Masonry at the same time. Why is this so difficult to understand? The
big red five pointed star that rules over Russia and China was made in
England and still gives allegiance to the same.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><b><font face="Book Antiqua">Do the "anti-Communists" know
this, or are they Masons too?</font></b></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">Russia is a menace to be sure, but
the British Empire originated the Russian system of Communism to exploit
the world as a front for British Imperialism while they use religion from
the churches to set up their scheme as a divine kingdom. Confusion comes
from everywhere but always the "poor" British Empire continues to crumble,
so says the propaganda...</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">...Is it not logical and reasonable
to see that anyone promoting such a gigantic movement as Communism is presumed
to be, would also be wicked enough to take precautions for <b>controlling
any opposition that might arise</b>? They could not hope for success if
they did not. So, as Marx and Engels were commissioned to launch social
and political Communism from London, <b>it was London also where pretended
anti-communism or Spiritual Communism originated for world consumption</b>.

<font face="Book Antiqua">Karl Marx, the founder of international Communism,
was born in Trier, Germany in 1818. At the University of Bonn and Berlin,
he studied law, history, Hegelian philsophy, and Feuerbach's materialism.
There he edited a radical newspaper which was suppressed, causing his removal
to Paris in 1843 and Brussels in 1845. With Frederic Engels as his closest
collaborator and disciple, Marx reorganized the Communist League, which
met in London in 1847. In 1848 he finalized the </font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Communist
Manifesto</font></i><font face="Book Antiqua"> and was expelled from Brussels
subsequent to the failed revolution in Germany which he helped to foment
with the Communist League. In 1849, Marx settled in London, where he studied
economics and wrote the first volume of his major work, </font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Das
Kapital</font></i><font face="Book Antiqua"> (1867), with volumes II and
III following in 1884 and 1894. He died in 1888 and was buried in Highgate
Cemetery, London.</font>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua">Karl Marx was the leading figure in the First
(Communist) International from 1864 until its demise in 1872. Lady Queenborough
noted in </font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Occult Theocrasy</font></i><font face="Book Antiqua">,
Chapter LXXXV, that the red flag was that of the First International, a
Masonic movement:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">In 1862, the First International
came into being and the part played in it by such Freemasons as Karl Marx,
Tolain, Fribourg, Varlin, Camelinat, Beslay, Malon and Corbon is well known...
Karl Marx, [was] later to be the moving spirit of the First International...
destined ultimately to form the keystone of subversion throughout the world.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">"...on the 5th August [1862], all
the delegates met at a dinner given to them by their English colleagues
at Freemason's Hall, where an address was read which formed, as it were,
the foundation-stone of the International..." Mazzini and Marx were entrusted
with the task of preparing the address and the constitution... A temple
worthy of their cult was sought and found... near Geneva, where... a fine
building, the Masonic Temple -- Temple Unique... was procured. ...the scheme
of the association having been settled in London in 1864...</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Book Antiqua">The International now hid itself
amidst the multitude of working men's societies of all descriptions that
were either authorized or at least tolerated, and made enormous progress
so that its chiefs at last declared themselves able to do without any extraneous
support. 'The International', said one of the speakers at the B&acirc;le
Congress (1869), 'is and must be a state within states; let these go on
as suits them until our state is the strongest. Then, on the ruins of these,
we shall erect our own fully prepared, such as it exists in every section...The
Commune installed at Lyons began its work by raising <b>the red flag -
that of the International</b>."</font></blockquote>
<font face="Book Antiqua">The question was posed in </font><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The
Union Jack</font></i><font face="Book Antiqua">: Do "anti-Communists" know
- that Communism was created in England and not Russia - or are they Masons
too?&nbsp; The answer is partially found in the scandalous profiles of
John Birch Society founders, as presented in <a HREF="belmont.html">The
Belmont Brotherhood</a>.&nbsp; The authors of this report also identify
for the reader the very sophisticated dynamic of using the anti-communism
crusade as a means of controlling opposition to international communism.&nbsp;
And with extraordinary insight the author of <a HREF="../www.ourhero.com/library/books/UnionJack-JewishConspiracyInEngland/uj-02.html">The
Union Jack: Political Messianism &amp; the Right Wing</a> explains the
psycho-political warfare involved in the Religious Right's war against
the Christian Church and the United States Government (if the reader can
overlook the author's amillennial eschatology and bias against Fundamental
Christianity).</font>
<p><font face="Book Antiqua">Our focus on the Religious Right continues
in a series of reports on the <a HREF="jbs-cnp.html">John
Birch Society</a>, its extension, the <a HREF="cnp.html">Council
for National Policy</a> and the <a HREF="discernment.html">British-Israel
Conspiracy</a>.</font>
