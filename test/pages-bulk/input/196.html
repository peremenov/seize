  <p>More than 30 student, faculty and staff volunteers from St. Lawrence University 
    spent part of the semester break assisting with recovery and cleanup efforts 
    at &quot;Ground Zero,&quot; the site of the September 11 collapse of the World 
    Trade Center's twin towers in New York City. From January 6 through 12, members 
    of the group worked at two locations near the site:<br>
    the coroner's office on 1st Ave., where rescue workers may bring the remains 
    of someone who, through DNA tests, has been identified as missing; and &quot;Ground 
    Zero&quot; itself, where a tent has been set up for volunteers to report for 
    assignments from coordinators working with the Salvation Army. Depending upon 
    those assignments, volunteers are dispatched to various sites where workers 
    are most needed, during the 3 to 11 p.m. shift. St. Lawrence volunteers have 
    been provided free lodging at a nearby YMCA facility. The project originated 
    at a North Country Scholar Day admissions event in November; attendees included 
    Disaster Relief Project Director for the Salvation Army Randy Widrick, a Colton, 
    New York, resident who has been in New York City since September 13. On-campus 
    coordination was done by St. Lawrence Leadership Academy Project Director 
    <b>Anne Townsend</b>.</p>
  <p> Former St. Lawrence University Nordic skiing and cross country running and 
    track star <b>Lawton Redman '98 </b>won his third US National Championship 
    in the last nine months and took the top qualifying spot for the U.S. Olympic 
    team at the Olympic Biathlon Trials.<br>
  </p>
  <p><b><font size="5">Town and Gown</font></b><br>
    St. Lawrence has formally requested that the Village of Canton annex four 
    University-owned properties on the north side of East Main Street, making 
    them part of the village. All are now part of the Town of Canton. In a letter 
    to Canton Mayor Robert Wells, Vice President for Administrative Operations 
    Thomas Coakley stated, &quot;Adding these properties would appropriately add 
    to the tax base of the Village and that is, in fact, our objective in making 
    this request.&quot;<br>
    Should the request be granted, the University will also request a zoning change 
    for the parcels, from their present Town of Canton designation as commercial, 
    to the village's &quot;highest permissible residential zoning.&quot; Coakley 
    pointed out in the letter that the properties in question all have deed restrictions 
    that limit their use to residential purposes.<br>
    The University has also requested that four additional properties be removed 
    from tax rolls, and be designated as tax-exempt properties. They are:<br>
    21 Elm Street - Viebranz Scholar residence<br>
    7 Maple Street - Safety and Security Officer<br>
    11 Maple Street - Office for Corporate and Foundation Relations<br>
    127 Miner Street - To be a vacant lot<br>
    &quot;These are properties that we utilize more directly in the operation 
    of the University,&quot; Coakley's letter states.<br>
    Town Supervisor David Button has referred the request to Town Attorney Charles 
    Nash, who plans to report to the town board in February with a recommendation.<br>
