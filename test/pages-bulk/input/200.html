<H1>Following Protest, Coordinator Will Not Live at Senior House</H1>

<P>Residential coordinators will not live in Senior House next year, announced Dean for Student Life Larry G. Benedict at a meeting with concerned Senior House residents.
<P>&#8220;There will be none of these people living at Senior House next year,&#8221; Benedict said at the Friday afternoon meeting amidst cheers from the audience. The coordinator slated to be housed in Senior House will instead live at Eastgate.
<P>Assistant Dean for Residential Programs Katherine G. O&#8217;Dair said that it was impossible to house a residential coordinator in Senior House because the the space for the coordinator had already been promised to a handicapped student.
<P>Coordinators will also live in Next House and NW30, the new dormitory for graduate students which will open in Fall 2001.<P>Burton-Conner was also mentioned as a possible home for a residential coordinator. However, Burton-Conner president Kiwah K. Kendrick &#8217;02 said that the dormitory was unlikely to accept the proposal in its current state. Benedict and O&#8217;Dair will meet with Burton-Conner tomorrow.<P>The Friday meeting was organized to deal with the negative student response to the residential coordinator proposal, which the deans announced earlier this month. About 75 students joined Benedict, O&#8217;Dair, Senior House Housemaster Henry Jenkins, and Director of Housing Operations Karen A. Nilsson for the discussion.

<P>Benedict and O&#8217;Dair also agreed  to rewrite the job description for residential coordinators. &#8220;The language [in the original proposal] was atrocious,&#8221; Benedict said.
<P>O&#8217;Dair added that coordinators would not be granted any disciplinary or judicial power.
<P>Under the new proposal, residential coordinators will serve both graduate students and undergraduates, O&#8217;Dair said.
<P>The original plan included one coordinator for all graduate students and three for the undergraduates.<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Deans address communication</B></FONT>
<P>After announcing the new residential coordinator plans, Benedict and O&#8217;Dair addressed student complaints about ineffective communication between students and the administration.
<P>Dormitory Council President Jeffrey C. Roberts &#8217;02 said he had known about the proposal as early as December. Dormcon didn&#8217;t inform the public of the status of the proposal because it felt it did not have enough details to advertise, said Dormcon Vice President Matthew S. Cain &#8217;02. &#8220;It was basically a big miscommunication,&#8221; Cain said.
<P>Roberts added that when he was first informed, the proposal &#8220;was not a plan ... my expectation was that when it became a plan, [the dormitories involved] would be be the first to hear. We just had a breakdown in communication.&#8221;
<P>The administration had also communicated with the Undergraduate Association and the Graduate Student Council, O&#8217;Dair said.
<P>&#8220;One thing we&#8217;ve learned is that we need to use multiple communication mechanisms, because as it is, the word doesn&#8217;t get out,&#8221; O&#8217;Dair said.<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Students prefer new proposal</B></FONT>
<P>Most attendees at Friday&#8217;s meeting acknowledged that Benedict&#8217;s new proposal was an improvement.
<P>Robin H. Ivester &#8217;01, who wrote the summary of student concerns provided to Benedict on Friday, said that Benedict&#8217;s appearance at the meeting helped rebuild students&#8217; trust in the administration.<P>&#8220;I think what he did shows us very clearly that he&#8217;s willing to work with us, for us,&#8221; she said.
<P>Other students commended the administration for responding to their concerns.<P>&#8220;I was pretty pleased with the outcome of the meeting,&#8221; said Senior House resident M. Maitland Lederer &#8217;03. &#8220;I was glad to see communication [between students and administrators] and not just yelling and name-calling.&#8221;<P>Lederer added that residential coordinators were &#8220;not a bad idea in principle&#8221; and that her main objections to the initial proposal were the original implementation plans and the wording.
<P>&#8220;It&#8217;s clear that Dean Benedict cares about the well-being of the students,&#8221; said Senior House resident Geoffrey L. Goodell &#8217;01.<P>However, Goodell expressed reservations about the administration&#8217;s failure to provide students with a long-term plan. He added that, without seeing Benedict&#8217;s long-term vision, the residential coordinator plan seems &#8220;like a solution begging for a problem.&#8221;
<P>Meanwhile, the GSC expressed its support for the new proposal.<P>&#8220;Among grad students, we like the concept of having another person to help with residential life,&#8221; said GSC Housing and Community Affairs Chair Shunmugavelu D. Sokka. &#8220;Undergraduates have a lot of support already, but we favor any help we can get.&#8221;
<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Students draft bill of rights</B></FONT>
<P>The controversy surrounding this proposal has inspired a group of students, led by Lederer, to create a &#8220;Students&#8217; Bill of Rights.&#8221; Currently in its early stages, the document outlines students&#8217; basic housing rights.
<P>Lederer said the idea had been tossed around by the UA and other groups. &#8220;It&#8217;s not incredibly novel, but it&#8217;s something that hasn&#8217;t been done yet,&#8221; she said.
