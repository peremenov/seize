<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></b></p><b>



<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#800080">How the Union Jack was formed.</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080"> </font></p></b>



<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080" size="7">I</font></b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080">N A.D.1194, Richard I of England

introduced the Cross of St. George as the Standard of England, and this remained the

national flag until the Union with Scotland. In 1603, King James VI of Scotland became

James I of England, as a result of which the first Union Jack was formed in 1606 by the

addition of the Cross of St. Andrew which formed the background of the new flag. The name <em>&quot;Union

Jack&quot;</em> came from King James, whose name is <em>&quot;Jacobus&quot;</em> in Latin,

and <em>&quot;Jacob&quot;</em> in Hebrew. Then in 1801, there was formed the more familiar

Union Jack by the addition of the Cross of St. Patrick, sandwiched in between the flags<b>

</b>of Scotland and England. Thus the formation of the Union Jack came about as the result

of the progressive merging of the inhabitants of the British Isles<b> </b>under one

throne, the throne of David. The completed Union Jack thus symbolises the RE-UNION OF

JACOB. </font></p>

<b>



<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#800080">The three covenants are

symbolised by the three flags which together form the Union Jack. </font></p></b>



<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080">We have been studying how God

made three covenants with His people, the fulfilment of which in the Anglo-Saxon race

proves that it is Israel. It is remarkable that if we take the three flags in the order in

which they form the Union - Scotland, Ireland, and England - then the three flags

symbolise the three covenants in the order God made them with Israel. For the sake of

illustrating this, a chart of the three covenants <strong>(Chart 2)</strong> is shown

after the flags <strong>(Chart 1)</strong> and in corresponding order. </font></p>



<p><b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080">&nbsp;</font></b></p><p>



<b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080">The first chart </font></b><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080">shows the

selection of Abraham to be the father of the specially trained race who would teach the<b>

</b>rest of humanity how to overcome disease and finally death. The mind of Abraham looked

forward like a searchlight to the <em>&quot;</em> <i>latter days,&quot; </i>when the many

promises made to him concerning his seed would be fulfilled. In the corresponding flag of

St. Andrew which forms the base of the Union Jack, the blue background indicates that the

power behind the destiny of Abraham and his seed was a heavenly or spiritual one, and that

the<b> </b>chosen race would eventually become such a people. The white cross is the sign

of multiplicity and symbolises Jacob's summing up of the Abrahamic promises as he passed

them on to Ephraim and Manasseh with his arms crossed, and his hands upon their heads.</font></p>

<font SIZE="2">



<p>&nbsp;</p>



</font><p><font SIZE="2"></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080"><strong>The second chart</strong>

shows the first stage in God's education of His servant race by the revelation of the

details of His law and righteousness in all phases of life. God promised that if Israel

kept the terms of the Mosaic Law Covenant, she would then be fit to bless the world as He

had promised her fathers. At that same time, He warned Israel that the BREAKING of the

laws in the Covenant would lead to the long period of scattering for </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#800000"><em>&quot;</em><i>seven times.&quot;</i></font><i><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080"> </font></i><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080">We know that Israel did break the Law

and sinned against God, thus showing their weakness and inability to rise to the high

standard set. They learnt the bitter lesson of their own sinful nature and of the

impossibility of becoming God's servant without supernatural aid. </font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080">When the flag of St. Patrick was

added in 1801 to form the Union, it was broken in the middle in order to leave a white

border showing between the red cross and the blue background. The broken cross, of course,

remarkably signified that Israel broke this agreement with God. It showed Israel as a

defective people, whose sin and transgressions were evidenced by their failure to keep

God's Law. It taught Israel the need of an outside Divine aid to mend their own broken

lives - the need of a new creation. The Mosaic Covenant reminded Israel all the time of </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#800080">BROKENNESS</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080">, lack of perfection, and it developed in

Israel </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#800080">A NATIONAL CONSCIENCE

OF RIGHT AND WRONG WHICH TO-DAY DISTINGUISHES ANGLO-SAXON PEOPLE FROM ALL OTHER NATIONS.</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080"> The fact that the cross is </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#FF0000">RED</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080"> typifies blood. God allowed certain transgressions of His Law to

be forgiven, provided that Israel sacrificed various animals in death. The animal thus

suffered death </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#800080">INSTEAD OF</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080"> the Israelite. Yet those animal

sacrifices went on from year to year and never overcame human depravity which caused

death. But through the sacrifices, God gradually revealed His purpose that some day </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#800080">ONE SACRIFICE</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080"> would be paid which would release Israel,

not only from temporary disease, but from death itself. </font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080">The third stage on the chart

shows the </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#800080">NEW COVENANT</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080"> being put into operation. When Christ

appeared at the commencement of his ministry, John the Baptist pointed to him, exclaiming,

</font></p>



<p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#800000"><em>&quot;<i>Behold,

the LAMB OF GOD, which taketh away the sin of the world.&quot;</i></em></font><i><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080"> - </font></i><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080">(JOHN<i> </i>1: 29.) </font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080">Lambs had been used in the Old

Covenant for many years as sacrifices to obtain healing and forgiveness. Now the Messiah,

though perfect, would himself suffer death as the one sacrificial lamb for Israel and the

whole world, that finally all might be forgiven and restored from death. Through breaking

the Mosaic law, the nation of Israel died, and their Law showed them why they died as

individuals. They were a people typified by a broken cross. Their only hope lay in the

mercy of God bringing about a new creation. Then came the next stage in their spiritual

education, the grace of the New Covenant, but Israel had to learn first the need of a

Saviour before they would accept him and be in a position to teach the other nations to

way of life. </font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080">The third flag of the Union Jack,

the Cross of St. George, is the very shape of the cross of Calvary, showing that it does

repre- sent the New Covenant of total forgiveness to Israel of all her transgressions. It

is a red cross, signifying again a blood covenant. At the last supper, Christ passed

around the cup of wine, saying, </font></p>



<p align="left"><i><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#800000"><em>&quot;For

this is my blood of the NEW TESTAMENT (COVENANT), which is shed for many for the remission

of sins.&quot; </em></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080">- </font></i><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080">(MATTHEW

26:28)</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080">Christ thus intimated that his

own blood would be shed as evidence that the price of death had been paid to redeem Israel

and save the world ONCE AND FOR ALL. The way was then clear for God's servant to be

cleansed and made perfect for ministry; and He extends the invitation to Israel to come

back to Him</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#800000"><em>&quot;I <i>have blotted out

as a thick cloud thy transgressions, and as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for 1 have

redeemed </i>thee.&quot;</em></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080">

- (ISAIAH 44: 22)</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#800000"><em>&quot;<i>I, even I, </i>am he

<i>that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy

sins.&quot;</i></em></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080"> -

(ISAIAH 43: 25)</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080">When the cross of England is

placed over the broken cross of Ireland to form the Union, the above scriptures are

dramatically symbolised. The broken cross, which, we have seen, represents the broken

Mosaic Covenant, </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#800080">IS BLOTTED

OUT</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080">. In the Union Jack, the

broken portion is still there, but covered up by the cross of England. This perfectly

symbolises the fact that the cross of Calvary covers and blots out the transgressions of

Israel. In spite of the fact that Israel disobeyed God, and broke His laws, resulting in

dispersion, God has promised to </font><em><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#800000"><i>&quot;remember their sin no </i>more.&quot;</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080"> </font></em><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080">How well the completed Union Jack

demonstrates that God has blotted out Israel's transgressions through the death of Christ.

</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080">Thus the British peoples, who own

the Union Jack, are particularly the nations of the Covenants, or the <em>&quot;</em><i>Covenant

People,&quot; </i>now rapidly nearing the consummation of their spiritual education and

preparation as God's servant nation. Soon Israel will be fully UNITED WITH GOD as His sons

to bless all nations. When Jacob of old prevailed with God at <em>Peniel</em>, the Lord

changed his name to <em><strong>&quot;ISRAEL&quot;</strong></em> which means <em>&quot;a

prince or son of God.&quot;</em> </font></p>

<p>



<i><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#800000">&quot;And he said unto him, What

is thy name ? </font></i><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#800000">. . . <i>Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but ISRAEL , FOR AS A

PRINCE </i><em>HAST</em><i> THOU POWER WITH GOD AND WITH MEN AND HAST PREVAILED.&quot; </i></font><i><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080">-</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#800000"> </font></i><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080">(GENESIS

32: 24-28)</font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080">Parallel with the formation of

the Union Jack, more and more of Jacob's descendants have become experimentally sons of

God, truly God's </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#800080">ISRAEL</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080">. During the days of England under the

Cross of St. George, there commenced the abandonment of idolatry, and the start of the

Protestant Reformation. In the days of the Union between England and Scotland, there came

the deeper spiritual awakening in the Wesleyan revivals. Then, under the completed Union

Jack, there commenced the world-wide ministry of the Anglo-Saxon Missionary and Bible

Societies. This was accompanied by a fuller Gospel including the truth of the second

advent of Christ, while to-day the Gospel of the Kingdom is being crowned by the

Anglo-Israel awakening, and the outpouring of the Spirit. </font></p>



<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080">Parallel with this progressive

return of Anglo-Saxon Israel to the God of their fathers, there has taken place the

promised multiplication and expansion of the race over the earth to form the

Ephraim-British Commonwealth of Nations, and the Manasseh-American Great Republic. From

1194 to 1606, the period of England under the single cross, the earth was almost

unexplored. Toward the close of this period, the first attempts at colonisation were made

in America. But most important of all, England defeated the Spanish Armada, which gave her

dominion of the sea, the sure foundation of England's future greatness. In the next

period, under the elementary Union Jack, 1606 to 1800, the British Empire was born by the

conquest of India and Canada, and by the annexation of eastern Australia; while the United

States emerged by the Declaration of Independence. Then the third and final period under

the completed Union Jack, 1801 to 1941+ has witnessed the full development of the British

Commonwealth of Nations and the great Republic of the United States of America. We now

look forward to the coming re-union of Britain and America, and to the unification of the

whole house of </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#800080">JACOB-ISRAEL

UNITED WITH GOD</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3" color="#000080">, to bless all

nations. </font></p>
