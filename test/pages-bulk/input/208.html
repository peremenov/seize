            <p>The defendant as a deaf mute</p>

            <p></p>

            <p>It was early morning, around 6.30 am, on 14 June 1991, when a warden 

              shouted to all the prisoners- &quot;Keep your cell clean and put 

              your prison dress on neat and tidy. Sit in the prison and keep silent.&quot; 

              We all understood that a VIP would visit the prison.</p>

            <p>Although we sat in our cells for nearly four hours, no one arrived 

              at the prison and we were all very hungry. We tried to ask a warder 

              when the VIP would arrive, but he knew nothing and said, &quot;I'm 

              also very hungry.&quot;</p>

            <p>It was nearly 12.00 when we heard a noisy whistle and the sound 

              of warders at the main gate. Many warders ran there shouting to 

              us, &quot;Sit in prison position and shut your mouths.&quot; We 

              knew that the VIP had arrived at the main gate. Fifteen minutes 

              later the VIP, escorted by many prison officers and warders, passed 

              through our cellblock. Ten minutes later, a number of warders shouted 

              to us that we could sit easy this meant the VIP had left the prison. 

              We didn't know why he had visited. We knew only that we had had 

              to sit in the prison position for long hours and felt happy because 

              we would have breakfast.</p>

            <p>While we were lying on our mats waiting for breakfast a warder 

              asked who Moe Aye was. He ordered me to get out of the cell. My 

              cellmates looked at me and I gave them a smile. We understood that 

              if someone was taken out of his cell at noon or night, it meant 

              a trial or re-interrogation. As soon as I stepped out a white hood 

              was pulled over my head. Then I had to follow him like a blind man.</p>

            <p>When I arrived in the main gate, someone asked about my background 

              for a few minutes. Then I was handcuffed and forced and get into 

              a car. I didn't know what kind of car and who was in there with 

              me. After driving for nearly five minutes the car stopped and realized 

              that I would be sent to the military court, as it was located in 

              front of the Central Prison, inside the same compound as the Central 

              Prison and my prison. Insein Special Jail. The hood was removed 

              from my head and I could see it was as I had thought - I was in 

              front of the notorious military court. One military intelligence 

              officer in plain clothes ordered me to get out of the car. Two policemen 

              lead me to a small room covered with wire mesh. I saw that there 

              were three other small rooms and a big hall nearby. I could see 

              the old, dirty wall of Insein Central prison from my room.</p>

            <p>At this stage I had been in prison for six months, after two months 

              at the MIS interrogation centre. It was not unusual for prisoners 

              to wait this long before they were tried. Some had to wait for years, 

              such as Min Ko Naing, the Chairman of the ABFSU, who was arrested 

              in 1989 in but not tried until 1992. During my six months in prison 

              before the trial, I was never even sure what I had been charged 

              with. Above the cell doors in formation about each prisoner was 

              posted by the authorities, stating the prisoner's name, number and 

              the section of the Act that the prisoner was charged under. However 

              the information about the charges was constantly changed for the 

              political prisoners. Sometimes I would leave to take my shower believing 

              that I was being charged under section 5(j) of the Emergency Provision 

              Act, but when I returned this had been changed to another Act. At 

              times these changes happened on a daily basis. For some prisoner 

              ever the nature of the allegations changed completely, so that one 

              day they would believe they were charged with stealing and the next 

              day this had changed to another charge, such as using drugs or even 

              just being homeless.</p>

            <p>I believe that the authorities had two objectives in mind by doing 

              this Firstly it was a psychological tactic to make the prisoners 

              confused. Secondly it was designed to make the warders lose respect 

              for the political prisoners, by suggesting they had committed criminal 

              acts. In Burmese culture it would be acceptable for the warders 

              to then treat the warders with much less respect.</p>

            <p>A few minutes after I had been taken to the room a plain-clothes 

              MIS officer, a police officer and two armed solders entered the 

              room and asked me about my background for a while. The MIS officer 

              said. &quot;Your will be sent to the military court soon. Please 

              keep in mind that you have no right to complain or make any reply 

              to the military court. If you do, your prison sentence will be doubled. 

              Now our commander, from MIS unit 7, has already decided to give 

              you five years imprisonment, but if you complain or reply with angry 

              words to the court, you will be sentenced to 10 years imprisonment.&quot;</p>

            <p>The police officer also said. &quot;You should keep quiet in the 

              court for the sake of your future.&quot; Then they lead me to the 

              court. After walking for two minutes, we arrived at a large room 

              and I saw that there were seven soldiers and five policemen, all 

              armed, standing near the doors in the hall. I was surprised that 

              there were so many people present just for my trial. There was a 

              low stage at the top of the hall, above which hung the Burmese flag, 

              and on either side of it large photographs of General Aung San and 

              the dictator Ne Win. There were many chairs, nearly 30 or 40, on 

              which some men in plain clothes were sitting. There were many ceiling 

              fans and the hall was silent except for the noise of the fans.</p>

            <p>Then I was forced to sit on the chair nearest the stage. A police 

              officer requested me to stand to pay respect while the members of 

              the military court were on the stage. Ten minutes later, three high-ranking 

              military officers emerged from a small room near the stage and stepped 

              onto the stage. At that time a police officer shouted for all to 

              stand and pay respect. After they time a police officer shouted 

              for all to be seated. He walked near the stage and passed some papers 

              to one of the members of the court. I knew that the court was made 

              up of three military officers - an army full colonel, a navy lieutenant 

              colonel and an air force lieutenant colonel. The officer form the 

              army was presiding, and read aloud, &quot;This is military court 

              number three and it will hear the trial of Moe Aye. The court will 

              be in session twice-to hear the case and to give judgment.&quot; 

              Then he looked at the police officer and gave a nod.</p>

            <p>The police officer stood and loudly read my case. I was accused 

              of many things, notably trying to assassinate the military leader 

              of the SLORC, trying to kidnap the families of high-ranking military 

              officers, trying to smuggle in arms from the borders and trying 

              to persuade young students to go to the jungle. I was also said 

              to have contacted many groups, most, of which I had never heard 

              of and didn't think even existed. The police officer concluded by 

              reading, &quot;Therefore I would like to respectfully request the 

              military court to give Moe Aye a heavy punishment for his anti-government 

              activities.&quot; I remember thinking that the crimes I was accused 

              of sounded serious enough to deserve the death penalty. After hearing 

              from the police officer, the presiding officer of the military court 

              said that they would think and decide on my punishment soon. Nobody 

              asked me whether any of the charges were true, or if I had anything 

              to say. No witnesses were called and no evidence was presented. 

              The court members returned to the room they had come from.</p>

            <p><br>

              I looked around the hall. Soldiers and policemen were standing alertly 

              and some police officers looked at the ceiling. Some MIS officers 

              sitting behind me looked outside. One army officer was walking near 

              the entrance. Then I looked at General Aung San and thought about 

              him. I wondered what he would say if he knew about this trial. A 

              few minutes later I saw a MIS officer in plain clothes entering 

              the room where the military court members had gone. Five minutes 

              later he came out again and came over to sit behind me. I realized 

              then that he was Captain Kyaw Zin Thet who had arrested me in November 

              1990. I understood at this point that the military court had adjourned 

              to wait for him, as he was the MIS officer in charge of my case. 

              Every aspect of the country is controlled by the MIS, including 

              the courts. Even though Kyaw Zin Thet was just a captain, it was 

              his role to direct the tribunal members, consisting of a full colonel 

              and two lieutenant colonels, what to convict me of and how many 

              years to sentence me to. No doubt that was what he had just done. 

              While I was trying to look back at him, a police officer shouted 

              for all to stand to pay respect to the court. The military court 

              members took their seats again.</p>

            <p>The army officer said slowly, &quot;After hearing these accusations, 

              the military court believes that Moe Aye has violated the laws and 

              it is clear that he tried to promote the anti-government movement. 

              After the 1988 anarchy, the milita4ry had to step in and was only 

              just able to save the country from falling into an abyss. Moe Aye 

              never thought well of the military and had a negative attitude towards 

              it. He tried to incite the people by claiming that the military 

              will never transfer power. He is trying to destroy the integrity 

              of the military and bring about further anarchy like that in 1988. 

              Therefore, according to the Emergency Provision Act, section 5(j), 

              the military court sentences him to seven years imprisonment with 

              hard labour,&quot; The court members stood and walked beck into 

              the room.</p>

            <p>I was really surprised about the trial, in which I had not been 

              asked anything. I had thought they would at least ask me whether 

              I was guilty or not guilty. When I tried to look at Kyaw Zin Thet, 

              he went out of the hall. Two police officers came over to me and 

              said, &quot;Thanks for your peaceful cooperation, allowing us to 

              finish the trial.&quot; I was surprised again and didn't reply.</p>

            <p>Finally I was sent back to Insein Special Jail gate in the car. 

              In the car as usual the hood was pulled over my handcuffs, which 

              I had worn throughout the trial, removed. When I arrived back in 

              my cell my cellmates jokingly asked me how many years I had contracted 

              with the junta to hire my room for. I replied &quot;It's a seven 

              year contract.&quot; I still remember that I had to have my breakfast 

              while my cellmates had their dinner on that day.</p>

            </p>

            <p></p>

            <p><span class="boldtxt">M</span>oe Aye was born in Mandalay in 1964 

              and was a student at the Rangoon Institute of Technology throughout 

              the 1988 pro-democracy uprising. During the uprising he joined the 

              All Burma Federation of Student Union (ABFSU). He later joined the 

              youth wing of the National League for Democracy (NLD), becoming 

              in-charge of information in Botahtaung Township. On the morning 

              of August 9, 1988, the army shot at him while he was demonstrating 

              nears the Shwe Dagon Pagoda in Rangoon. </p>

            <p>He was arrested by Military Intelligence on November 7, 1990. Moe 

              Aye was charged under Section 5(j) of the 1050 Emergency Provision 

              Act and was sentenced to seven years imprisonment with hard labour. 

              At the time of his arrest, he was working for the ABFSU and was 

              also carrying out duties for the NLD youth.</p>

            <p>While in Insein Special Prison Moe Aye met Mr.James Leander Nichols 

              and learned how the honorary consul to four Scandinavian countries 

              was being questioned and beaten by November 22, 1996, and due to 

              the harsh condition in prison he had to seek intensive medical treatment. 

              Some six months later Moe Aye left for Thailand and is now living 

              there. He is a regular correspondent for Democratic Voice of Burma 

              (DVB), a radio station based in Oslo, and has articles regularly 

              published in The Nation, a daily newspaper in Thailand.<br>
