<P align=left>
       Most of us know our Sun signsâ€"Libra, Aries, Sagittarius, Pisces, and so on through
       the zodiac. But how many of us know what sign the Moon was in at the moment of our
       birth? Though people of all sexes have an astrological Moon, women have a special
       affinity for this mysterious lady of the nightâ€"no matter where you stand in the
       butch-femme line-up. Luna rules women, moms, the public, the tides, the menstrual
       cycle, the moods and emotions. She is intuitive and psychic. She symbolizes the great
       Goddess in all her phases, from maiden to warrior to mother to crone. Planting by Moon
       sign improves garden production, and planning by Moon sign can improve every phase of
       your life. The Moon rules home, family, motherhood, and childbirth. Whereas the planet
       Mercury rules the analytical, intellectual brain, the Moon rules the entire mind, which
       receives knowledge and wisdom directly from the universe, the subconscious, and the
       collective unconscious. She also rules habits and unconscious knowledgeâ€"like
       knowing how to tie your shoes, drive a car, cruise a cutie without getting busted.
<P align=left>
       The Moon gives form to your Sun sign, the way a mother gives form to the spark that
       becomes her child. You may have a rambunctious Aries Sun, but with a Libra Moon,
       youâ€™ll warm up that drive and assertiveness with diplomacy, tact, consideration and
       uncertainty. With a Leo Moon, youâ€™re Xena II! There are 144 Sun-Moon
       combinationsâ€"whatâ€™s yours? Your Lunar Phase at birth will tell an astrologer a lot
       about your mission in life, and the lunar nodesâ€"a lot more, even, according to Indian
       astrologers, your true life path.
<P align=left>
       Although women as a rule seem much more in touch with lunar energy than men do, still,
       Western Civilization keeps trying to steer us away from the irrational, illogical, deep
       and ancient wisdom of lunar energy, and toward rationality, logic, "common sense",
       clock time, schedules, facts and figures. In fact, Don Miguel Ruiz, author of the highly
       recommended "The Four Agreements", calls modern urban humans "domesticated".
       Which means tamed, intimidated, dumbed down, uptight, cut off from our instinctual,
       lunar selves. To be truly joyful and connected, we need the freedom to honor our
       instinctive, lunar identity, which in fact is a big part of our overall personality!
       Learning your Moon sign, natal Lunar Phase, and sign and house placement of your
       lunar nodes, is a first step toward better self-understanding.
<P align=left>
       For those who follow the paths of Wicca, Tibetan Buddhism, and so many other
       spiritual practices, following the phases of the Moon, and celebrating the New and Full
       Moons every month, are an important part of worship. Honoring the new and full moons
       monthly, even with a single white candle, can help to reconnect you when youâ€™re
       feeling lonely, cut off, depressed, flat and dull, or trapped in a boring job, a
       frustrating relationship, an environment that doesnâ€™t bring you happiness. If you
       donâ€™t have one, find a picture that you love of any one of the great Goddesses of
       any world religion, from Virgin Mary to Kali to Kwan Yinâ€"or even mix and
       match!â€"make a tiny little shrine to the Goddess on your bookshelf or window sill, and
       start watching the moon phasesâ€"with a calendar, the newspaper, or one of the many
       online resources that track the phases, such as Lunabar.com. Light that candle twice a
       month on the new and full moons, light some great incense, ring a bell, give her a
       brownie or a glass of vodka, and ask Her for guidance, wisdom, love, health, and luck.
       Connect with her during your period, too. Chanting, drumming, dancing, singing, playing
       music, making freeform artwork, playing games, meditating, casting spells, working
       with Tarot, I Ching or runes or other non-linear spirit work can help forge a link back
       to your lunar self, and back to wholeness and happiness.
<P align=left>
       The New Moon in March is the 14thâ€"the Full Moon is on the 28th. The New Moon is a
       great time to start a new project. The Full Moon is a time to reap, and a time to wrap up
       loose ends.

        <P align=left>

                                     # # #


<P align=left>
       Since March brings the spring equinox and the Sun moves into the Cardinal sign of
       Aries, Iâ€™ll give you a quick thumbprint of Moon in Aries: Restless, impatient, quick,
       fiery, assertive, a natural leaderâ€"Aries Moon likes to be numero uno. Even women
       with Aries Moon are male chauvinists! Theyâ€™ve always got one eye on the future and
       hate to wait in line, and slowpokes drive them nuts. They want to be independent, free
       to come and go at will, and they want to do things their own way. They like speed and
       efficiency. Their leadership style is "you can follow me or not-but Iâ€™m gonna be out
       there in front!" A lot of folks with Aries Moon will tell you they had horrible fights at
       home, especially with dad. They tend to drive too fast, even though their skills and
       coordination are usually excellent. A partner with Aries Moon needs a long leash.
       Unless the Moon is cooled off by a tough aspect from planets such as Saturn or
       Neptune, you need action, speed, and lots of good lovinâ€™.
<P align=left>
      <b>  ARIES </b>
<P align=left>
       Youâ€™ll experience your Solar Return on or near your birthday, the time when the
       transiting Sun comes home to the exact place of your natal Sun, setting the tone and
       theme for the coming year. The first three weeks of the month may find you feeling
       like you want to check in to a nice quiet convent or ashram or rehab joint somewhere,
       spend some down time meditating and retreating from all the craziness. This is a great
       time to clean up some old loose ends, spend time at the hot springs, a yoga or meditation
       weekend, hit that 12-step program a little harder, stay out of the bars and off the X,
       and put in time at the library, university, hospital, prison (hopefully as a volunteer!), or
       whatever other institution you might be linked to. With the Pisces Sun transiting
       through your 12th House of Self-Undoing, keep your nose clean nowâ€"figure out in
       what way you are your own worst enemy, and stifle that behaviorâ€"for a while
       anyway.
<P align=left>
       On March 20thâ€"sistah!--break out the champagneâ€"the Sunâ€™s crossed over into
       your first house and the sign of Aries, itâ€™s the spring Equinox, full speed ahead for
       you rams and lambs, and the Sunâ€™ll be hooking up with Venus, putting an extra
       bounce in your step and zapping up your love life. Mars through your 2nd house may
       bring financial opportunities beginning the 7th. On the 1st, it may be a good time to buy
       property or new furniture to spruce up the love shack. Itâ€™s also an especially good
       month for group activities with your sewing circle or biker club or drumming gang.
<P align=left>
     <b>   TAURUS</b>
<P align=left>
       The Sunâ€™s in your solar 11th house until the 20th. Time spent socially, with your
       "people", your groups, political activist group, dream circle, folks you have common
       cause withâ€"can be energetic, exciting, and way fun. Follow that dream, tooâ€"focus
       on some of your big life goals, both the possible and the impossible ones. Like they say,
       write it down, make it happen. If youâ€™re in business for yourself, this may be an
       "up" period for your balance sheet. This is a great time to bring in new people into your
       circle, make new friends, making your goals public. 
<P align=left>
       On March 20th, when the Sun moves into your solar 12th, things will tend to quiet down
       for you. Do some spring cleaning, paint the kitchen, pay off your credit card, do a
       cleanse, get off your Taurus "tochas" and go for a hike or a weekend bike ride. Spend
       some down time with a few close friends, a lover, a cat, or yourselfâ€"get off your
       earth-bound trip for a while, light some incense, get a tarot reading, have a massage,
       go hang gliding, or just a nice hot bath with some bath salts and candles and wine.
       Educational action is good this month. You may get some added responsibilities at work
       this month, or find you need to tighten your purse strings a little bit. There may be
       health worries with a parent, or maybe some confusion or delusions or general
       weirdness at work. The full moon on the 28th may make everybody a little edgy;
       donâ€™t forget your Full Moon ceremony!
<P align=left>
    <b>    GEMINI</b>
<P align=left>
       Emphasis on career this month, boss-type people, maybe even good old Mom. This is a
       great time to put some extra shine on things at work; Venus in your solar 10th will give
       you some nice opportunity to mix business with pleasure, too! You might feel inspired
       artistically, musically, or moved to volunteer some time at the local childrenâ€™s
       hospital, or to help a friend move (if youâ€™re REALLY a saint!). The pagan festival of
       Ostara occurs on March 21st, the spring Equinox, which coincides roughly with
       Easterâ€"a little spring fling is definitely called for. You might be a little more serious
       and hard-working this month, not quite your usual Gemini motormouth self. Careful who
       you slip off with for a night of joy this monthâ€"your emotions arenâ€™t as reliable as
       usual. And there might be a real strong urge to do some spring cleaning around
       relationships, especially on the 22nd.
<P align=left>
     <b>  CANCER</b>
<P align=left>
       Pisces Sun in your solar 9th house this month puts the spotlight on travel, higher
       education (including online study), publishing, spiritualityâ€"and horses (for all you
       pony girls and boys)! On the 20th, the emphasis shifts to your career, your reputation,
       and your status (including new committed relationships). You might push for more
       money and recognition now, and spend time with Momâ€"if that relationship is rocky,
       this might be a time to take steps toward healing. You might feel inspired to get actively
       involved in political or social activism this monthâ€"but donâ€™t be SO enthusiastic
       that you turn everybody else off! You might tend to weight gain this month so lay off
       the Oreos. The stars might nudge you toward some real electric sex this month, and it
       also might be a time for you to finally decide to dump that nowhere job and reach for
       something more satisfying.
<P align=left>
  <b>      LEO</b>
<P align=left>
       The first three weeks of the month may be a good time to think about financial
       security, to take a look at debts, taxes, mortgages, and your and your partnerâ€™s
       shared resources. If youâ€™re thinking of getting counseling for any reason, during
       this period you may have easier access to your dreams and your subconscious
       mindâ€"all that buried STUFF that needs to get thrown out. Clean out closets,
       basements, attics. You may get financial or other support from people who want to help
       out. Long-distance travel, continuing ed, or working with exotic types may happen for
       you now. After the 20th, you may feel a new energetic push at work in your career.
       Jupiter going direct in your 12th house may help improve health issues, especially with
       stomach and digestion. And keep openâ€"you may meet somebody truly magical and
       excitingâ€"and friendship may turn to looooooove!
<P align=left>
  <b>      VIRGO</b>
<P align=left>
       This is a month for romance, tying the knot, signing a contract with a business partner,
       bursting into the public eye if youâ€™re a performer. Itâ€™s also a great month to
       start a new relationship, or buff up your current oneâ€"make some resolutions together
       to strengthen the bond. You may feel a real drive to fix up the apartmentâ€"new paint,
       new pix on the wallâ€"or maybe something even more ambitiousâ€"tearing out a wall
       and putting in new linoleum in the kitchen. Toward the 20th of the month start taking a
       look at your investments, taxes (you may have filed an extension), how the two of you
       manage your joint bank account or household budget, or if youâ€™re in business
       together, getting that start-up loan or seed money from a backer. From the 15th
       onâ€"possible chances for new romance!
<P align=left>
     <b>   LIBRA</b>
<P align=left>
       Emphasis for the first three weeks of this month are on your job (NOT your career!)
       your health, your pets, and your employeesâ€"if you have any! For those fortunate souls
       whose jobs are also their career, attention you pay to streamlining your efficiency and
       effectiveness on the job could pay off in increased profits for you. Also, if you have
       healing skills and talents, these first three weeks are a great time to attend a
       workshop, or add something new to your healerâ€™s tool kit.
<P align=left>
       After the 20th, the Sun moves into Libraâ€™s FAVORITE houseâ€"the 7th, house of
       partnership, marriage, committed relationships, as well as business partnerships, legal
       contests, and the Public Eyeâ€"where some Venus-ruled Libras love to be! From the
       20th on is a great time for a commitment ceremony, signing a partnership or business
       agreement, settling a lawsuit, or moving in with Ms. Wonderful.
<P align=left>
       The new moon in Libra on the 28th is a great time to start a new projectâ€"just not a
       dietâ€"wait until just after the full moon for that! As the Moon gets
       smallerâ€"hopefully you will too!
<P align=left>
   <b>     SCORPIO</b>
<P align=left>
       Lucky Scorpio! This is your month to have some fun! Creativity, romance, entertainment,
       gambling, playing or watching sportsâ€"and kidsâ€"all these things are a great place
       for Scorpio to focus on in March. Any kid-centered projectâ€"childrenâ€™s theatre,
       day care, starting a baby, adopting a childâ€"is favored for you this month. Itâ€™s not
       really the time to try to get serious in a relationshipâ€"this time is better for just
       having some romantic, casual fun. Wait until late April to move in together!
<P align=left>
       Those in a tight relationship might run the risk of have a little domestic spat this
       monthâ€"resolve ahead of time to agree to disagreeâ€"and fight fair!
<P align=left>
       After the 20th, itâ€™s time to focus special attention on your job and your health. If
       youâ€™ve been promising yourself youâ€™re going to start lifting, or running, or
       walking, or even crawling, this is a great time. Just say no to that third helping of
       Heath Bar Crunch.
<P align=left>
       Hold off any serious spending that involves you and your partnerâ€"instead, you may
       suddenly decide to re-wire the apartment just for laughs.
<P align=left>
    <b>    SAGITTARIUS</b>
<P align=left>
       It might be a little early to be getting the garden ready for plantingâ€"but all 4th
       house activities are highlighted for Sag this monthâ€"home, hearth, family, the house,
       gardeningâ€"sometimes "dad" issues are favored now tooâ€"if you need to mend
       fences with the old guy, this is a time to make steps. Social events at home are
       favoredâ€"and even though you Sagittarii have trouble staying in one place for long,
       this might be a good time to put in some work around the house, or stay home and study
       hard for midterms. For some Sadges, this is the month to tie the knot; for others, if
       things are looking bleak in the relationship department, this may be the period when it
       gets over with for good.
<P align=left>
       Things speed up at work this month; this is also a good time to invest some cash in
       something conservative like a bond fund or utilitiesâ€"you might also get a nice little
       financial windfallâ€"pay down your credit card debt!
<P align=left>
       If youâ€™re into the arts, this is a great time for creative effortsâ€"write that new
       song, get your novel finished, go get another tattoo, show yourself off at a slam poetry
       reading!
<P align=left>
 <b>   CAPRICORN</b>
<P align=left>
       Neighborhood and community matters shine for you the front part of the monthâ€"and
       if that seems pretty boring, how about your evil siblings, uncles and aunts,
       communications of all kinds (teaching, learning, the news, reading, writing, cheat
       sheets, documents, mental/intellectual work), and lots of short trips and travel? After
       the 20th, pull in your focus to your own home and family and circle of loved ones. 
<P align=left>
       Work may get intenseâ€"you might find yourself working overtime, or being handed
       extra responsibilitiesâ€"donâ€™t let yourself be a workaholic, which Capricorn can be
       prone to. Capricorns tend to rise through administrative and management kinds of work,
       so if they hand you a bunch of extra assignments, show â€˜em what you can do! It may
       lead to a promotion.
<P align=left>
       Your snoop factor may be get a big boost this month with Pluto in the
       12thâ€"investigative, behind the scenes, and research work might be just what
       youâ€™re good at right now.
<P align=left>
 <b>  AQUARIUS</b>
<P align=left>
       Money, money, moneyâ€"financial matters get the spotlight the first three weeks of
       Marchâ€"specifically, money you earn directly through workâ€"not your investments,
       tax return, lotto ticket or trust fund! Your income, your personal possessions (your
       furniture, DVD player, Twister game) and your valuesâ€"the things that really matter to
       you--get the highlights. The 2nd house is also ruled by Ms. Sensuous
       herselfâ€"Venusâ€"you and your main squeeze might try something a little new and
       different this month in the passion departmentâ€"maybe a new flavor of Kama Sutra
       oil? Something featuring feathers?
<P align=left>
       Then, on the 20th, itâ€™s out of the sack and onto the sidewalk as the focus moves
       more toward community type involvements in your neighborhood, calling your brother in
       St. Louis, or taking your Real Estate exams. 
<P align=left>
       Youâ€™ve also got the universe pulling for you this month as you sit down with pencil
       and paper and really get serious about your dreams and your goals.
<P align=left>
 <b>      PISCES</b>
<P align=left>
       This month, the spotlight is on you, yes, YOU, Pisces person! So get the gum out of your
       hair, find your car keys, find out if your 1997 tax return is actually somewhere back
       in the closet behind that stack of songs you wrote five years agoâ€"and put your best
       foot forward. This is about youâ€"your charisma, your leadership (?), making a good
       first impression, and kicking off an important new project (a great time to start
       something new would be the new moon on the 13th). 
<P align=left>
       Then, on the 20th, uh-oh, money. Actually, it might be a good time to boost your income,
       or balance your checkbook (z-z-z-z) or ask for a raise. Things might get serious around
       the house at some point during the monthâ€"you might have to get that leak in the
       basement fixed or move all your tropical fish tanks out of the spare bedroom. Things
       might get shook up a little if you work at an institution, like a library or schoolâ€"but
       this might also be a great time to get the boss to take you a little more seriously
       tooâ€"things could move up a notch for you in the career department this monthâ€"make
       your move! <P align=left>

   For anyone fortunate enough to be passing through PA,  the culinary experience is something you will never forget and want to repeat in your own kitchen. 
<P align=left>
   These folks originally populated Pennsylvania in
   the 1680s and were primarily Mennonites, Seventh Day Baptists,
   Moravians, Amish, and a few other groups. They were
   soon joined by Reformed and Lutherans. These
   Germanic groups brought with them the recipe secrets and kitchen magic
   that makes Pennsylvania Dutch cooking so sought after. 
<P align=left>
   The term PA Dutch is not an accurate as they are Germanic
   in heritage. The German way to say German is Deutsch and Dutch is a bastardization of that. Here, each month, you will find some of the most wonderful taste delights which require relatively little creativity in the kitchen, just follow the directions!<P align=left>

<b>Funnel Cake</b><P align=left>
3 eggs <br>
2 cups milk <br>
4 cups flour <br>
1/3 cup sugar <br>
1 Tablespoon baking powder <br>
Oil for frying 
<P align=left>
Beat eggs and add milk.  Sift dry ingredients together and beat the egg-milk mixture into it. 
Continue beating until batter is smooth.  Let stand while you heat the oil to 375 degrees.  You
need at least 3 or 4 inches of oil. 
<P align=left>
Batter can be poured into a small pitcher for easier handling.  Use a funnel closed off at the
end by your finger.  The funnel should have an opening of at least 1/2 inch and be able to hold around a cup of batter. Pour some batter into the funnel.  Take your finger off the end and swirl
the batter in concentric circles into the hot oil.  Fry until golden brown on both sides.  Drain
on paper towels.  Sprinkle with powdered sugar or cinnamon sugar, and serve hot.  Or you can
serve them with maple syrup or a table molasses (like King syrup) for breakfast.
