<b><font face="Arial" size="2">Western men die some five years earlier than
women. They suffer more from nearly every medical disease and ailment that there is.
And yet, far more money is spent by governments on women's health than on men's
health. Men are also nowadays educationally disadvantaged significantly compared to
women; with the curriculum, the teaching methods and the resources being
designed to cater far more for women and girls than for men and boys. Men make up 80% of the homeless. There are more of them in
social service care-homes as <i>
<u>boys</u></i>. They are <u><i>many</i></u> times more likely to be wrongfully arrested, wrongfully imprisoned, mugged, assaulted or murdered. They are 5 times more likely to lose their
children when families break down, 4 times more likely to lose their homes, 4 times more likely to commit suicide,
20 times more likely to be killed or injured at work, 20 times more likely to be
imprisoned, and, probably, more than 100 times more likely to be demeaned, denigrated and ridiculed by the
mainstream media. Men also pay much more in taxes than women but receive far
less in benefits from the government.<br>
<br>
In other words, when compared to women, men are
significantly disadvantaged when it comes to their health, their homes, their
children, their education, their families, the tax burden, the law, the benefit
system, and even when it comes to their
own personal
safety.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 They are nowadays also being heavily discriminated against in the work
place.<br>
<br>
How is it possible, therefore, that women are being 'oppressed' more than men?<br>
<br>
In what areas?<br>
<br>
Where?</font></b></p>

        earn quarter of a million pounds more than women during the course of
        their lifetimes!</font></b></font></i></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>The article <a href="esWomendonotDeserveEqualPay.htm">Women Do Not
        Deserve Equal Pay</a> explains
        some of the reasons why it is that, statistically speaking, women earn
        less than men. And it explains why there is nothing sinister about this,
        for the figures simply demonstrate the consequences of women's biology
        and the choices that they make.</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Here we look at the ridiculous,
        distorted propaganda propounded by the EOC, squeezed out from the very
        same figures.</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>The EOC is currently trumpeting the
        fact that men, on average, earn quarter of a million pounds more than
        women during the course of their lifetimes, and that, therefore, this
        reveals some terrible injustice being done to women.</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>So, let's look at what this figure
        really means.</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Firstly, it means that men pay about
        £90,000 more in taxes than do women. In other words, the average man
        puts £90,000 more into the pot than does an average women. Your average
        man is therefore supporting women to the tune of £90,000. Just one
        average man!</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Bearing in mind also, that when it
        comes to benefits, such as health, pensions and income support, a
        whopping 70% of the budget is actually spent on women's needs, it is
        absolutely clear that the support, in the UK, given by men to women, is
        phenomenal, and it shows just how much the men in the UK truly hand over
        to women via the government coffers.&nbsp;</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Further, men also hand
        money over directly to women when they stay at home to look after the
        kids. And why shouldn't they stay at home to look after the kids if
        that's what the pair of them want? Why should feminists try to make
        women go out and earn the same as their partners?&nbsp;</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>So, what do the feminazis at the EOC
        do with these figures? Well, as usual, they twist their real meanings
        and turn them into man-hating propaganda. Thus, they are currently
        squawking loudly about this quarter of a million pounds with a deliberately
        distorted spin designed to make women feel aggrieved, disadvantaged and
        hateful towards men.</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>But let me show you something.</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Imagine that the figures were the
        other way round. Imagine that women earned quarter of a million pounds
        more than men during the course of their lifetimes. What would the
        feminazis at the EOC be saying then? It doesn't take much imagination,
        does it?</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Here are the headlines.</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>&quot;Women are having to do all the
        work. Women pay more taxes than men. The tax laws are discriminatory
        because they take more from women.&quot; And do you know what would happen next? There
        would be a major government initiative to stop benefits for men, and
        demand that they take up any work that was on offer. The government would
        set different tax rates for men and women in order to make sure that men
        could not benefit from 'sex-discriminatory'
        tax laws.</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>But the EOC figures show that UK men
        put hell of a lot more into the pot, and they take hell of a lot less
        out of it. And it is still the case that while men die seven years
        earlier than women, they are still expected to work for five more years
        before receiving their pensions.</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>This is going to change in the future,
        thanks to Brussels and the European Commission. But do notice that,
        working for five years longer and receiving seven years less of pension,
        adds up to a massive twelve years of financial injustice. A truly
        blatant, ongoing act of sex discrimination. An enormous act of
        discrimination. And what has the EOC done about this? Nothing. Nothing at
        all.</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>People really must take on board the
        fact that the EOC is a feminist organisation dominated by all the
        selfish, self-centred slogans of feminism. It is probably the most
        sex-discriminatory body in the land, despite its cosy name, and it
        should have been abolished a long time ago.</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>An Equal Opportunities Commission
        whose sole aim seems to be to diminish and demean constantly one half of
        the population by distorting the facts, the figures and their
        implications, cannot be allowed to continue to exist.</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>The EOC costs a fortune, but all it
        does is stir up anger and resentment within women against the very men
        who support them - and massively so.</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Do the feminists at the EOC really
        want women to have
        to work for the same number of hours as men, doing the same types of
        jobs, for the same number of years, for the same pay, putting the same
        proportion of money into the pot, and getting the same amount out?</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>And if so, who is going to look after
        the kids?</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>The stupidity of Feminism, and
        hence of the EOC, is that in its blind, hysterical vindictiveness toward
        men, it actually hurts all real women as well, particularly the majority
        of women, who do not want to devote most of their lives and their
        energies to whatever it is that they might have to do to earn a decent
        wage.</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>A few million UK women want to be mothers
        who stay at home, or just do jobs part time. What is wrong with that?</b></font></p>


        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>And while so many women continue to
        CHOOSE to do this, men are BOUND, statistically speaking, to be earning
        more than women.</b></font></p>
