                    Parachute?</p>
                  <p class="standfirst">By Robin McCulloch</p>
                  <p>I remember the gesture very clearly. It was done with a care 
                    for detail that informed all the work we did as improvisational 
                    performers. It was like seeing one of those international 
                    symbols inside the red circle, &#8220;no smoking,&#8221; &#8220;no 
                    left turn&#8221; or &#8220;no dogs allowed.&#8221; I would 
                    be on stage in front of a couple of hundred people, improvising 
                    a scene I had pitched to one of my improv collaborators. Suddenly 
                    you see the fear in their eyes; the hand would go to the chest 
                    as if clasping something and then the distinct pull away from 
                    the chest followed by the smile, half mocking, half seeking 
                    forgiveness. Your improv partner had &#8220;hit the chutes&#8221;. 
                    The gesture was that of pulling the ripcord on a parachute 
                    and meant that they were bailing out. They sensed the scene 
                    was going down in flames and as it hadn&#8217;t been there 
                    idea in the first place, why stick around for the crash.</p>
                  <p><em>Does this have a familiar ring? Have you felt the clarion 
                    call of the washroom sirens just as the meeting took a turn 
                    for the worse? Or watched a colleague bail out on you when 
                    things started to get tough? Maybe one of your kids broke 
                    a rule, needs to be &#8220;spoken to&#8221; so knowing your 
                    spouse is better at &#8220;that sort of thing&#8221; you head 
                    out to &#8220;clean&#8221; the garage.</em></p>
                  <p>And we had no real excuse. We were supposed to be, arguably, 
                    some of the best professional improvisers in the world. We 
                    were on stage at the Toronto wing of The Second City, the 
                    Mecca of improvisational comedy. A stage that had been, or 
                    would be, graced by John Candy, Catherine O&#8217;Hara, and 
                    the rest of their SCTV comrades, Mike Myers, Gilda Radner 
                    and Dan Aykroyd&#8230;a very long list of accomplished improvisers 
                    and actors. Also, the concept of &#8220;hitting the chutes&#8221;, 
                    as we referred to it, was against the very principles of improvisation. 
                    Support, agreement, acceptance and saying &#8220;yes&#8221; 
                    to each new offer, these were the foundation of good improvisation.</p>
                  <p>So why would such accomplished improvisational performers 
                    abandon each other to certain theatrical death? Maybe to understand 
                    the fear you need to be aware of exactly what was being attempted 
                    in the first place. There is a cyclical nature to the creative 
                    process that exists at The Second City so it&#8217;s always 
                    hard to know where to break into that cycle to start the explanation. 
                    But let&#8217;s assume that a show has already been created 
                    by you and your fellow cast members. Each night you would 
                    do that set show, two acts, ninety minutes total, on average, 
                    of memorized material. Then after taking a curtain call you 
                    would get suggestions from the audience in various categories: 
                    current events, occupations, pet peeves, etc. You would take 
                    the suggestions back stage while the audience, you hoped, 
                    would seek out that perfect mix of alcohol intoxication that 
                    makes the jokes seem funnier but doesn&#8217;t make the audience 
                    think they&#8217;re funnier than the people on stage.</p>
                  <p class="subhead">The Pitch</p>
                  <p> Once you have the suggestions backstage, posted on the bulletin 
                    board, you would immediately start pitching ideas to each 
                    other based on a combination of suggestions or a single suggestion 
                    or, to be honest, on something you had thought of that afternoon 
                    while gazing at a waitress in a bar. You would have fifteen 
                    minutes to pitch a couple of ideas, get someone to buy into 
                    one or more of them, rope someone into the thankless roll 
                    doing the grunt work to introduce your brilliant concept, 
                    exchange some quick ideas about characters, grab a drink and 
                    smoke before the lights start coming back up for the post-show 
                    improv set. </p>
                  <p><em>Sound like some work meetings you&#8217;ve been in lately? 
                    No time to solve too many problems while the folks that pay 
                    your salary wait to see what kind of brilliant concepts you 
                    discover.</em></p>
                  <p>While some of the other performers are out on stage taking 
                    their chances you&#8217;re backstage, going over, in your 
                    head, how you imagine the scene playing out. Then your turn 
                    arrives. The lights come up to find you on stage and immediately 
                    things start to change from the course you had imagined. The 
                    performer you had enlisted to do the compulsory role of the 
                    hotel Doorman has decided that the scene really revolves around 
                    him. It is no longer a scene about two lovers sneaking into 
                    a hotel for an afternoon tryst, but one about a Doorman who 
                    secretly suffers from leprosy. Some initial shtick about a 
                    one-handed Doorman suddenly makes your original partner decide 
                    that the scene is no longer what they had agreed to and they 
                    are refusing to enter. It doesn&#8217;t take long for the 
                    Doorman to realize the leprosy joke is just that, a joke, 
                    and will not carry a scene very far. He uses his good hand 
                    to clasp the imaginary ripcord on his chest, hits the chute 
                    and exits, leaving you alone, looking at your watch as the 
                    lights fade to a smattering of confused applause. </p>
                  <p><em>I&#8217;m betting you can see the parallels with trying 
                    to pitch your concept, which you thought your partner was 
                    fully behind, for the new project. Suddenly he has a second 
                    possibility that he has &#8220;just thought of&#8221; and 
                    the other members of the team have come down with laryngitis. 
                    </em></p>
                  <p class="subhead">The Post Mortem</p>
                  <p> What went wrong is that a group of highly competitive individuals 
                    were attempting create something new in front of two hundred 
                    people who had just seen ninety minutes of one laugh after 
                    another. The audience didn&#8217;t know that the set show 
                    they had just laughed through had started out as first time 
                    improvisations in an improv set like the one they were now 
                    watching. That it had been worked, re-worked, re-written and 
                    rehearsed for months. No one told the audience that the performers 
                    were abandoning the principles that made them successful. 
                    How could they know that the very laughs that the performer 
                    got as they backed off stage, at the expense of the scene 
                    and fellow performers, were dooming the scene to failure?</p>
                  <p><em>I am sure you have all witnessed a fellow colleague getting 
                    some laughs as they threw someone to the wolves to save their 
                    own hide. You watch all that work go down the drain because 
                    someone started feel the pressure and decided to hit the chute.</em></p>
                  <p>So what is the difference, then, between success and failure 
                    in improvisation? Pretty much the same as it is in other aspects 
                    of work and life. You can usually trace it back to commitment. 
                    How much do you buy-in to the concept in the first place? 
                    How committed are you to the team? If saying &#8220;yes&#8221; 
                    is really just a subtly disguised &#8220;no&#8221; in the 
                    form of &#8220;okay I&#8217;ll go out there with you but I 
                    don&#8217;t think this is going to work&#8221;, then you can 
                    almost hear the ripcord being pulled as the lights come up. 
                    That gentle fluttering you hear is the room emptying even 
                    though the bodies may still be there.</p>
                  <p class="subhead">The Solution</p>
                  <p> To improvise well, you commit yourself on two levels, first, 
                    to the principles of improvisation, acceptance, support, justification, 
                    saying &#8220;yes&#8221;, and second, to the specifics of 
                    the scene you are improvising. And your commitment can&#8217;t 
                    be dependent on things staying the same because change is 
                    inevitable.</p>
                  <p>The audiences at The Second City are usually very forgiving 
                    because they understand that making it up on the spot is difficult 
                    but is also rewarding when it all comes together in a magical 
                    experience that seems too good to believe. But it is one thing 
                    to be in the audience when it doesn&#8217;t come together 
                    and quite another to be one of those poor souls on stage, 
                    descending into comedy hell. Nothing quite focuses the survival 
                    instincts like that first smell of failure; the first realization 
                    that, Martian surgeons discovering why we have an appendix, 
                    may only be funny to you. And once the not-funny veil starts 
                    to descend over a scene most uncommitted improvisers start 
                    to hear their mothers calling them home for dinner or if not 
                    for dinner at the very least, OFF STAGE! </p>
                  <p>But when you see improvisation that is committed from the 
                    start, ideas that seemed doomed at birth suddenly take the 
                    most unexpected turns and become these amazing products of 
                    positive cooperation. The desperate search for the &#8220;Big 
                    Idea&#8221; seems unnecessary. &#8220;Big Ideas&#8221; go 
                    nowhere without support and commitment. &#8220;Bad ideas&#8221; 
                    can develop into great concepts with a supportive, committed 
                    process.</p>
                  <p> The Second City was my office. Improvisation was the work 
                    I did there. And the one thing above all others that made 
                    the difference between failure and success was the level of 
                    commitment.</p>
                  <p><em>Understanding the value of real commitment, to the team 
                    and to the concept, can improve a team&#8217;s success rate 
                    and innovative potential dramatically.</em></p>
                  <p>Think about this the next time you join a new project or 
                    things seem to be going off the tracks or you realize your 
                    Doorman only has one hand. When you feel yourself reaching 
                    for that imaginary ripcord, ask yourself if you&#8217;re really 
                    committed or you&#8217;re just &#8220;hitting the chute&#8221;? 
                    Throw your parachute in the garbage because nothing is more 
                    exciting or rewarding than using your support and imagination 
                    to turn defeat into victory. <em>And improvisation embodies 
                    the principles that allow you to create solutions in a parachute 
                    free workplace.</em><br>
