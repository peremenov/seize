            <h1><a name="topofpage"></a>The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty: History 
              and Current Problems</h1>
            <h3><a href="#bio">George Bunn</a></h3>
            <p> Fifty years ago this month, President Dwight D. Eisenhower gave 
              his &#147;Atoms for Peace&#148; address to the UN General Assembly. 
              He proposed to share nuclear materials and information for peaceful 
              purposes with other countries through a new international agency. 
              That speech led to negotiations which, several years later, created 
              the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The IAEA today has 
              the dual responsibility of helping countries that do not have nuclear 
              weapons to engage in peaceful nuclear programs while ensuring that 
              they do not make nuclear weapons. In the <a href="/documents/npt.asp">nuclear 
              Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT)</a> of 1968, the IAEA gained authority 
              for policing the nuclear activities of member countries to ensure 
              that those without nuclear weapons did not acquire them.<br>
              <br>
              Today, the NPT is a worldwide treaty that bans all members except 
              the United Kingdom, China, France, Russia, and the United States 
              from having nuclear weapons and commits those five states to eventually 
              eliminating their atomic arsenals. The treaty provides the norm 
              and the foundation for an international regime to prevent the spread 
              of nuclear weapons around the world. The 187 states that subscribe 
              to the NPT include all significant states of concern with the exception 
              of India, Israel, Pakistan, and&#151;arguably&#151;North Korea.<a href="#notes">[<font size="1">1</font>]</a> 
              According to Ambassador Robert T. Grey, a former U.S. arms control 
              negotiator, the NPT is &#147;in many ways an agreement as important 
              as the UN Charter itself.&#148;<a href="#notes2">[<font size="1">2</font>]</a> 
              Yet, many believe that the NPT regime is battered and in need of 
              strengthening.<a href="#topofpage">[<font size="1">3</font>]</a> 
              <br>
              <br>
              The NPT has in fact suffered major blows. Since 1991, uranium enrichment, 
              plutonium separation, and other possibly weapons-related activities 
              that Iraq, North Korea, and Iran hid from IAEA inspectors have been 
              discovered. Iraq&#146;s weapons program was found after the 1991 
              Persian Gulf War thanks to UN Security Council orders demanding 
              more intrusive inspections than were then required by IAEA inspection 
              standards. North Korea&#146;s weapons program later became known 
              through intelligence, IAEA inspections, and North Korea&#146;s own 
              admissions. The IAEA&#146;s discovery of Iran&#146;s failure to 
              disclose experiments with plutonium separation and uranium enrichment 
              to inspectors has recently led to a standoff with Tehran. <br>
              <br>
              Historically, the IAEA has rarely demanded inspections beyond the 
              perimeter of reactors or related nuclear sites that had been declared 
              open for inspection by the countries where they were located. Further, 
              uranium enrichment and plutonium separation does not violate the 
              NPT if done for peaceful purposes under IAEA inspection. In fact, 
              a number of more developed countries (e.g., Japan) conduct such 
              activities. In the three countries where uranium enrichment or plutonium 
              separation was thought to have been conducted for weapons purposes&#151;Iran, 
              Iraq, and North Korea&#151;the activities had taken place largely 
              at locations not declared open for inspection to the IAEA. <br>
              <br>
              Moreover, that North Korea and Iran both obtained enrichment technology 
              from Pakistan suggests dangers to the NPT regime from nonparties 
              that are not bound by the treaty&#146;s prohibition against assisting 
              non-nuclear-weapon states in acquiring nuclear weapons. The back-to-back 
              nuclear tests by New Delhi and Islamabad in 1998 illustrate the 
              dangers that an arms race in South Asia can have and suggest the 
              temptation that such tests could encourage current non-nuclear-weapon 
              parties to withdraw from the treaty in order to follow suit. <br>
              <br>
              At the same time, the United States has not complied with some of 
              its own NPT-created obligations. For example, in 1995 the United 
              States won the agreement of the non-nuclear-weapon NPT states-parties 
              to extend the NPT indefinitely by promising to negotiate a <a href="/documents/ctbttxt.asp">Comprehensive 
              Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)</a>. The treaty was duly negotiated and signed 
              by President Bill Clinton in 1996, but the Senate failed to ratify 
              it in 1999. The Bush administration now opposes the CTBT, and the 
              Senate is unlikely to consider it again, at least before the next 
              election. That reflects a broader tendency by this Bush administration 
              to downgrade treaties and regimes and to upgrade unilateral efforts, 
              such as the pre-emptive use of force against Iraq, to enforce compliance 
              with nonproliferation. <br>
              <br>
              In addition, the Bush administration has undertaken efforts to create 
              new types of nuclear weapons that might well require new testing.<a href="#notes4">[<font size="1">4</font>]</a> 
              Thus, while pushing other countries to reject the acquisition of 
              nuclear weapons for their defense, the United States seems to be 
              relying ever more heavily on nuclear weapons for its own defense. 
              This double standard constitutes another threat to the NPT regime.<br>
              <br>
              These points are all relevant to the status of the NPT today and 
              will be explained in more detail below or in other articles in this 
              issue. <br>

              <b>Early Nonproliferation Efforts</b><br>
              <br>
              Eisenhower&#146;s 1953 &#147;Atoms for Peace&#148; speech came after 
              the failure of earlier U.S. nonproliferation efforts. At the end 
              of World War II, when the United States had the only nuclear weapons 
              in the world, President Harry Truman proposed to destroy the U.S. 
              nuclear arsenal if other countries would agree not to acquire nuclear 
              weapons and would permit inspections to verify that agreement. The 
              &#147;Baruch Plan&#148; of the Truman administration would have 
              given an agency under the jurisdiction of the UN Security Council 
              a monopoly over research on how to make nuclear explosives and the 
              power, free of veto and backed up by military force if necessary, 
              to conduct inspections in other countries to make sure they were 
              not making nuclear weapons. The United States, however, would not 
              surrender its weapons to the agency until inspectors were on duty 
              in the Soviet Union and in other countries with nuclear potential. 
              The Soviet Union rejected this approach; it was already seeking 
              its own nuclear weapons. Skeptical about the Baruch Plan being debated 
              at the United Nations, the U.S. Congress enacted the 1946 Atomic 
              Energy Act with provisions designed to keep nuclear technology secret 
              from other countries.<a href="#notes5">[<font size="1">5</font>]</a> 
              <br>
              <br>
              By contrast, Eisenhower proposed providing assistance to other countries 
              in the peaceful uses of atomic energy. As a result of his proposal, 
              the U.S. Atomic Energy Act was amended to authorize nuclear assistance 
              to others, and the IAEA was created to provide both assistance and 
              inspectors for peaceful nuclear activities. The United States, followed 
              by the Soviet Union, France, and others, began providing research 
              reactors that used weapons-usable, highly enriched uranium (though 
              usually in lesser amounts than needed for a weapon) to non-nuclear-weapon 
              states around the world. These transfers and the training that accompanied 
              the reactors helped scientists in many countries learn about nuclear 
              fission and its potential uses. <br>
              <br>
              As these scientists moved up the nuclear learning curve, global 
              support increased for controlling the spread of the new technology 
              in order to prevent its use for weapons. Soon, debate about nonproliferation 
              in the UN General Assembly produced a 1961 consensus Irish resolution 
              saying that countries already having nuclear weapons would &#147;undertake 
              to refrain from relinquishing control&#148; of them to others and 
              would refrain &#147;from transmitting information for their manufacture 
              to States not possessing&#148; them. Countries without nuclear weapons 
              would agree not to receive or manufacture them. These ideas were 
              the basis for the NPT.<a href="#notes6">[<font size="1">6</font>]</a> 
              <br>
              <br>
              The United States submitted a simple draft treaty based on this 
              resolution to the Soviet Union when a new 18-nation Disarmament 
              Conference opened in Geneva in 1962. The Soviet response was to 
              insist on a treaty that would prohibit the arrangements that the 
              United States then had with NATO allies such as West Germany for 
              deployment, in their countries, of U.S. nuclear weapons under the 
              control of U.S. soldiers&#151;weapons to be used to protect these 
              countries, if necessary, in the event of an attack on them by the 
              Soviet Union and its allies. The Soviet proposal and U.S. plans 
              for a &#147;multilateral force&#148; of naval vessels with nuclear 
              weapons&#151;vessels manned by sailors from participating NATO countries 
              and under NATO command&#151;became major obstacles to agreement. 
              By then, the multilateral force plan was strongly supported only 
              by West Germany. However, for the United States to agree that an 
              NPT should prohibit U.S. allies not having nuclear weapons from 
              joining in control of U.S. nuclear weapons in peacetime required 
              meetings with President Lyndon Johnson at Camp David, further negotiations 
              with Soviet representatives, recommendations to the president from 
              an important committee of distinguished advisers, lengthy discussions 
              with West Germany and other allies, a congressional resolution urging 
              negotiation of a nonproliferation treaty, and bureaucratic maneuvering 
              to gain Johnson&#146;s approval for proposed treaty language. <br>
              <br>
              In the compromise, the United States gave up on the multilateral 
              force; the Soviets gave up on a prohibition against U.S. deployment 
              of nuclear weapons in West Germany (and other allied countries), 
              provided the weapons remained under sole control of U.S. personnel. 
              The non-nuclear-weapon states were asked to accept draft language 
              which prohibited them from having nuclear weapons and which called 
              for the IAEA to be permitted to carry out inspections to guarantee 
              that their nuclear programs were limited to peaceful uses. In addition, 
              the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and the United States agreed 
              to provide assistance to non-nuclear-weapon NPT members in their 
              pursuit of peaceful uses of nuclear energy and agreed to conduct 
              future negotiations to halt the nuclear arms race and reduce their 
              nuclear weapons with the goal of achieving nuclear disarmament. 
              <br>
              <br>
              Negotiations then began for gaining acceptance of these provisions 
              by important non-nuclear-weapon governments and their parliaments 
              and for prescribing the inspections that would be conducted by the 
              IAEA pursuant to the NPT. India, which had participated actively 
              in the NPT negotiations as a country without nuclear weapons, refused 
              to join. It wanted to retain the option to produce its own nuclear 
              weapons as its then-adversary, China, already had. Pakistan, another 
              adversary of India, refused to join because India would not. Israel, 
              which the United States had tried to restrain from acquiring nuclear 
              weapons in separate negotiations during the 1960s, also refused 
              to join. China and France had not participated in the NPT negotiations 
              but had acquired nuclear weapons before its negotiation was completed. 
              The NPT draft permitted them to join the treaty with the same rights 
              and duties as the other nuclear-weapon states&#151;the United Kingdom, 
              the Soviet Union, and the United States. They did so later. <br>
              <br>
              States began signing the treaty in 1968, and it went into force 
              in 1970. However, the negotiations at the IAEA among parties and 
              potential parties on the scope of inspections for non-nuclear-weapon 
              parties continued for several years. Many countries, including West 
              European allies of the United States, did not ratify the treaty 
              until these negotiations were completed to their satisfaction.<a href="#notes7">[<font size="1">7</font>]</a> 
              There were also further negotiations every five years at NPT review 
              conferences. These dealt with implementation of treaty provisions 
              such as those promising assistance to non-nuclear-weapon states 
              for peaceful uses and calling for reductions of nuclear weapons 
              and for nuclear disarmament. At an important conference in 1995, 
              the treaty was extended indefinitely from its initial 25-year term.<a href="#notes8">[<font size="1">8</font>]</a> 
              The 1995 decision and the review conference of 2000 focused particular 
              attention on the NPT-related promises of the nuclear-weapon states 
              to &#147;cease the nuclear arms race&#148; including stopping nuclear 
              testing, negotiating reductions of nuclear weapons, and eventually 
              achieving nuclear disarmament.<a href="#notes9">[<font size="1">9</font>]</a> 
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>Current Problems</b><br>
              <br>
              Even as the legal regime was expanded by these agreements, the NPT 
              came under strain elsewhere. One of the most significant blows was 
              Iraq&#146;s demonstrated ability to hide its nuclear-weapon-making 
              efforts from IAEA inspectors before the Gulf War. With inspection 
              authority from UN Security Council resolutions adopted after that 
              war&#151;authority beyond what the 1970s negotiations on NPT verification 
              standards had given the IAEA&#151;inspectors found previously hidden 
              Iraqi efforts to enrich uranium to make nuclear weapons and even 
              an attempt to use (for a weapon) highly enriched research-reactor 
              uranium provided for peaceful purposes by France and the Soviet 
              Union.<a href="#notes10">[<font size="1">10</font>]</a> <br>
              <br>
              These findings produced a major effort to strengthen the IAEA&#146;s 
              NPT inspection authority through an additional protocol. The IAEA 
              parties who negotiated the 1997 model for this protocol did not 
              agree, however, that the NPT required its parties to accept the 
              model, as had been the case with earlier IAEA safeguards standards. 
              It is now up to each NPT party to negotiate with the IAEA a revised 
              safeguards agreement pursuant to the model.<a href="#notes11">[<font size="1">11</font>]</a> 
              As of mid-2003, only 81 of 187 NPT states had negotiated new safeguards 
              agreements; only 37, or about 20 percent, had given final approval 
              to them through parliamentary or other ratification.<a href="#notes12">[<font size="1">12</font>]</a> 
              Even the United States has not yet adopted legislation to implement 
              its new safeguards agreement. Some non-nuclear-weapon states may 
              be holding back, asking why they should take on more nonproliferation 
              obligations when, as they perceive it, the United States rejects 
              an important one&#151;the CTBT prohibition on nuclear testing&#151;and 
              then proposes new types of nuclear weapons for itself.<a href="#notes13">[<font size="1">13</font>]</a> 
              <br>
              <br>
              After the experience with Iraq, IAEA inspectors sought new techniques 
              to deal with other problem states such as North Korea. Some evidence 
              was produced by IAEA inspectors in the 1990s using a new technique 
              called &#147;environmental monitoring&#148;&#151;testing for small 
              traces of evidence of nuclear activities in the air, on walls or 
              vegetation in areas within or surrounding a nuclear site, or in 
              streams or rivers nearby. This is explicitly authorized in the 1997 
              Mode Additional Protocol for use even at sites far from the reactors 
              that a country has declared open for inspection.<a href="#notes14">[<font size="1">14</font>]</a> 
              Results from using these and other techniques at declared sites 
              encouraged the IAEA to press North Korea for broader inspections 
              in the early 1990s, but Pyongyang refused. A stalemate between North 
              Korea and the IAEA eventually led to bilateral negotiations between 
              the United States and North Korea and the 1994 Agreed Framework 
              between the two countries which called for Pyongyang to dismantle 
              a reactor whose spent fuel rods had apparently been used by North 
              Korea to produce plutonium. Pyongyang was also asked to provide 
              information about its past activities. These steps were to be in 
              exchange for the construction of new, more proliferation-resistant 
              nuclear reactors from South Korea and Japan, as well as interim 
              supplies of heavy-fuel oil from the United States.<a href="#notes15">[<font size="1">15</font>]</a> 
              However, North Korea appears to have engaged in nuclear-weapon activities 
              at other sites after the 1994 agreement was inked. During 2002-2003, 
              North Korea and the United States each concluded that the 1994 agreement 
              was not to their liking, and North Korea announced its withdrawal 
              from the NPT.<a href="#notes11">[<font size="1">16</font>] </a><br>
              <br>
              Discovery of Iran&#146;s failure to disclose experiments with plutonium 
              separation and uranium enrichment to IAEA inspectors has triggered 
              concern since last year. Using environmental monitoring and other 
              techniques at declared sites and undeclared sites that Iran permitted 
              them to check, the IAEA inspectors uncovered many suspicious items, 
              including tiny samples of enriched uranium, tubes apparently used 
              for enriching uranium in centrifuges, and stocks of unenriched uranium&#151;none 
              of which Iran had reported to the IAEA. In negotiations with the 
              United Kingdom, France, and Germany, Iran agreed to sign an additional 
              protocol authorizing broader inspections in Iran and to put aside 
              its uranium-enrichment plans, at least for the time being. Though 
              the IAEA director-general&#146;s report shows that Iran had not 
              disclosed to earlier inspectors its uranium-enrichment efforts or 
              an experiment in plutonium separation, he concluded that the IAEA 
              lacked direct proof that these efforts were for the purpose of making 
              weapons&#151;to the consternation of officials in the United States. 
              The IAEA Board of Governors then adopted, with U.S. support, a decision 
              to order continued inspections in Iran for clandestine activities.<a href="#notes17">[<font size="1">17</font>]</a> 
              <br>
              <br>
              The uranium-enrichment and plutonium-separation efforts of Iraq, 
              North Korea, and Iran have produced renewed calls for the NPT not 
              to permit such efforts even if subject to IAEA inspection. The concern 
              is that, once a country gains access to this technology, it might 
              then withdraw from the NPT (as North Korea did) and use its stocks 
              of weapons-usable uranium or plutonium to make weapons. The Nuclear 
              Supplier&#146;s Group (NSG) had earlier recommended that new uranium-enrichment 
              and plutonium-separation plants of non-nuclear-weapon states be 
              placed under multilateral ownership and control so that the co-owners 
              from the different countries could check on each other.<a href="#notes18">[<font size="1">18</font>]</a> 
              However, Japan; some western European non-nuclear-weapon countries; 
              and Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, and a few others, as well as 
              all the nuclear-weapon states, have or have experimented with enrichment 
              or reprocessing facilities. Should these all now be subject to a 
              rule requiring multilateral ownership and oversight? Would limiting 
              the requirement to non-nuclear-weapon countries be regarded as adding 
              further insult to the NPT&#146;s existing discrimination in favor 
              of nuclear-weapon states? IAEA Director-General Mohamed ElBaradei 
              has recommended that all enrichment and reprocessing facilities 
              used for civilian purposes should be multilaterally owned and controlled 
              in the future, with each country involved being urged to check on 
              what its partner countries are doing to make sure that the enriched 
              uranium or separated plutonium is not used for weapons purposes.<a href="#notes16">[<font size="1">19</font>]</a> 
              <br>
              <br>
              The Bush administration has pressed hard on Iraq, Iran, and North 
              Korea to restrain them from acquiring nuclear weapons, but it has 
              done so sometimes in unilateral or domineering ways that seem inconsistent 
              with a multilateral regime like that of the NPT. The American-led, 
              counter-proliferation-justified, preventive-war invasion of Iraq 
              in 2003 that the United States waged without UN Security Council 
              authorization is a recent example. At the time, the invasion was 
              said to be necessary to prevent Iraq from again acquiring nuclear, 
              biological, or chemical weapons or long-range missiles. It took 
              place even though Security Council-authorized inspections, consistent 
              with the NPT, were going on in Iraq to look for these weapons. It 
              resulted in UN inspectors being withdrawn from Iraq for their own 
              safety. U.S inspectors have subsequently found little evidence of 
              ongoing biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons programs but the 
              decision reflected Bush&#146;s tendency to downgrade treaties and 
              international efforts in favor of more proactive proliferation efforts.&#148;<a href="#notes20">[<font size="1">20</font>]</a> 
              <br>
              <br>
              Likewise, the Senate failed to ratify the CTBT in 1999. The Bush 
              administration has not asked the Senate to reconsider that vote 
              and instead has said that the United States &#147;will not become 
              a party&#148; to that treaty.<a href="#notes21">[<font size="1">21</font>]</a> 
              At the same time, the administration seeks money from Congress for 
              new types of nuclear weapons&#151;ones that may well need testing 
              before the United States would rely on them. However, in 1995, when 
              the United States negotiated an agreement with all the non-nuclear-weapon 
              states to extend the NPT beyond 1995, it agreed to negotiate a CTBT 
              by 1996 as part of the price it had to pay to gain agreement to 
              renew the NPT.<a href="#notes22">[<font size="1">22</font>]</a> 
              The CTBT was negotiated by 1996. Then, in the 2000 NPT review conference, 
              the Clinton administration agreed on &#147;the importance and urgency&#148; 
              of ratification of the CTBT &#147;without delay&#148; to &#147;achieve 
              the early entry into force&#148; of the treaty even though the Senate 
              then had no plans to vote again on the CTBT.<a href="#notes23">[<font size="1">23</font>]</a> 
              Is the CTBT such an essential element of the nonproliferation regime 
              that U.S. failure to join it could provide persuasive justification 
              for withdrawal from the NPT for those who choose to do so?<a href="#notes24">[<font size="1">24</font>]</a> 
              <br>
              <br>
              Other problems of this sort occurred with Article VI of the NPT, 
              agreed to in the original treaty negotiations in order to gain the 
              support for the treaty of non-nuclear-weapon states. In that provision, 
              the United States and the other recognized nuclear-weapon states 
              promised to negotiate nuclear-weapon reductions with the goal of 
              nuclear disarmament. Then, to gain the votes of these parties for 
              extension of the NPT in 1995, the United States agreed to pursue 
              &#147;progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally, with 
              the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons.&#148;<a href="#notes25">[<font size="1">25</font>]</a> 
              At the 2000 NPT review conference, the Clinton administration made 
              similar commitments. It also promised to implement START II (negotiated 
              in the prior Bush administration) and to conclude &#147;START III 
              [more reductions] as soon as possible while preserving and strengthening 
              the <a href="/documents/abmtreaty.asp">[Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM)] 
              Treaty</a> as the cornerstone of strategic stability.&#148;<a href="#notes26">[<font size="1">26</font>]</a> 
              <br>
              <br>
              These promises were shredded when the present Bush administration 
              withdrew from the ABM Treaty. The withdrawal nullified START II 
              because the Russian Duma had conditioned its approval vote for START 
              II on a continuation of the ABM Treaty. The substitute for START 
              II negotiated with Russia by President George W. Bush, the Strategic 
              Offensive Reductions Treaty of 2002, required withdrawal of warheads 
              from many long-range missiles on each side to the end that, by 2012, 
              no more than 2,200 warheads would be deployed on either side.<a href="#notes27">[<font size="1">27</font>]</a> 
              The treaty, however, does not require the warheads to be destroyed, 
              calls for no inspections, has a more permissive withdrawal clause 
              than in START II, and contains no stated plan for a subsequent treaty 
              such as START III that would require further reductions. Does this 
              satisfy the NPT commitment to negotiate toward nuclear disarmament? 
              ElBaradei has suggested that the United States may be employing 
              a double standard by not actually cutting its own arsenal of nuclear 
              weapons (as distinct from its missiles) while attempting to restrain 
              other countries from acquiring nuclear weapons.<a href="#notes28">[<font size="1">28</font>]</a> 
              <br>
              <br>
              To gain the agreement of the non-nuclear-weapon NPT parties to the 
              treaty&#146;s extension in 1995, the United States also made promises 
              in connection with a UN Security Council resolution calling for 
              what are called negative security assurances, which for the United 
              States was a promise not to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon 
              NPT parties unless they attack the United States while in alliance 
              with another nuclear-weapon state.<a href="#notes29">[<font size="1">29</font>]</a> 
              Yet, in its Nuclear Posture Review of 2001 and its National Strategy 
              on Weapons of Mass Destruction of 2002, the Bush administration 
              made clear that it was prepared to use nuclear weapons against a 
              non-nuclear-weapon NPT party that threatened the use of chemical 
              or biological weapons against the United States or its allies whether 
              or not this NPT party was allied with a nuclear-weapon state.<a href="#notes30">[<font size="1">30</font>]</a> 
              Thus, the United States watered down another promise that was important 
              to gaining the support of non-nuclear-weapon NPT states-parties 
              for renewal of the NPT in 1995. Whether all these problems will 
              produce further withdrawals from the NPT is, of course, unknown, 
              but they might be used as excuses for withdrawal by any who want 
              to do so. <br>
              <br>
              <b>What Has the NPT Accomplished?</b><br>
              <br>
              The NPT nonproliferation norm, the long-term efforts of the United 
              States and others to gain acceptance of it, and the international 
              inspections the NPT produced deserve significant credit for the 
              fact that the world does not now have 30 or more countries with 
              nuclear weapons. <br>
              <br>
              In 1963 the Department of Defense looked at the motivations of the 
              &#147;nuclear-capable&#148; countries at the time and estimated 
              for Kennedy that perhaps 10 more of them could have nuclear weapons 
              and suitable delivery vehicles in less than a decade if nothing 
              was done to prevent such a scenario from unfolding; they were the 
              remaining major industrialized Group of Seven allies of the United 
              States plus China, Czechoslovakia, India, Israel, Poland, and Sweden.<a href="#notes31">[<font size="1">31</font>]</a> 
              Thus, based on the 1963 list, 14 or more countries could have had 
              nuclear weapons by the early 1970s.<br>
              <br>
              The Defense Department&#146;s list did not include Switzerland, 
              Australia, South Korea, or Taiwan, which all had scientists who 
              were then considering or would soon consider how to build nuclear 
              weapons. It did not include South Africa, which later built several 
              nuclear weapons, then gave them up and, like the others, joined 
              the NPT. It did not include any republics of the Soviet Union. Three 
              republics&#151;Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine&#151;had Soviet 
              weapons on their territory when the Soviet Union collapsed and gave 
              them up to join the NPT after negotiations with Russia and the United 
              States supplied them with financial incentives and promises not 
              to attack them with nuclear weapons. Without the NPT norm, these 
              countries would probably not have given their inherited weapons 
              up. The Pentagon list did not include Argentina and Brazil, which 
              later began nuclear weapons programs but then negotiated a bilateral 
              agreement not to acquire nuclear weapons and joined the NPT&#151;turning 
              rivalry into cooperation in response to the norm of the NPT and 
              of a Latin American Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone agreement.<a href="#notes32">[<font size="1">32</font>]</a> 
              <br>
              <br>
              North Korea, Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq began later and were not on 
              the Pentagon&#146;s 1963 list either.<a href="#notes33">[<font size="1">33</font>]</a> 
              If there had been no NPT, if all these countries plus the ones on 
              the list acquired nuclear weapons, the total would have been at 
              least 28 by now. Some neighbors and rivals would then probably have 
              been motivated to acquire nuclear weapons themselves. What would 
              the total have become? More than 30 countries with nuclear weapons? 
              Today, we have nine counting North Korea but not Iran.<br>
              <br>
              The single most important factor in producing this success has been 
              the nonproliferation norm established by the NPT and the incentives 
              for remaining non-nuclear that the NPT helped initiate. The next 
              most important factor has probably been leadership, cooperative 
              efforts, and financial assistance in some cases from the United 
              States working with many other NPT parties.<a href="#notes34">[<font size="1">34</font>]</a> 
              Given the more difficult nonproliferation and security challenges 
              of today, it is vital that U.S. leadership be used to strengthen, 
              not to weaken or abandon, the nuclear nonproliferation regime.
