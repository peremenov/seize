			<li><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#5D573B">Please take special 
			care when using candles, melts, tarts or any scented products around 
			children, pets and </font><b>
			<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000000">especially around birds 
			and parrots</font></b><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#5D573B">. 
			Do not place near flammable objects such as curtains, walls, etc. 
			Place only on a protected, heat resistant, level surface. Keep 
			candle free of wick trimmings, matches, or other foreign matter that 
			could be a fire hazard. Avoid burning in drafts. This will cause 
			candle to burn more quickly and unevenly. Please never walk around 
			with lit candles. Please trim wicks to 1/4 inch at all times to 
			avoid carbon build up on the wick.</font></li>
			<li><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#5D573B">Some of the tart 
			burners/melters, simmer pots, potpourri burners etc. on the market 
			are not suitable for the intended use. Please take special care when 
			using these products. <i><b>Never use any of these left untended nor 
			use around children and pets, especially birds and parrots!</b></i> 
			Make sure the tea light candle is a good distance from the underside 
			of the burner where the wax is. If the wax gets too hot, the burner 
			can be come over heated and cause the aroma to burn away to fast and 
			may cause safety issues. It is our opinion that the tea light or 
			heat source should be no less than 2.5&quot; from the holder. When using 
			scented oils you must always add water to the oil in the dish. Make 
			sure you keep adding water as it will evaporate. If water is NOT 
			added, the dish may crack. Try to use wax melts/tart not the oils as 
			you should not have the worry over adding the extra water.</font></li>
