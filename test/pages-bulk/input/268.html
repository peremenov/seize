<span class="acs_name">Maisyboo, Cardiff</span><br />
<span class="acs_text">As a nurse in Cardiff Royal Infirmary I often worked on the night shift - here many strange things happened to staff.  In the staff room one night I heard heavy breathing close to me - other staff who'd been in the room had heard it!  A nurse was later in the room and something sat down on the mattress beside her! In the sluice room we would get our uniforms pulled by something unseen! A nurse also saw a ghostly apparition floating across the ward. And when the hospital was closed finally the call buzzers could be heard even though they had been dismantled!!</span>

<span class="acs_text">I go to West Mon school and I saw the figure of a small boy running around corridors.  Then a few days later during an exam some teachers were called to the music rooms because a small girl had fainted after supposedly seeing a small boy drenched in water standing in front of her desk, before disappearing as she blinked.  Can anyone tell me anything about what happened at West Mon?</span>

<span class="acs_text">If you walk on Penarth Pier late afternoons, a figure of a women dressed in Victorian clothing strolls by you and lurks at the end of the pier staring out over the sea. I thought it was a fancy dress event, but learned that a Victorian lady oftens haunts the pier.</span>

<span class="acs_name">Kelly Groves from Crawley</span><br />
<span class="acs_text">My partner and I stayed at the Skirrid Inn for the night and encountered some strange happenings.  For one we chucked all of our jewellery including two necklaces, watch, ring and bracelet on to the dresser - minutes later we hear the sound of jingling, look at the dresser and the jewellery is neatly arranged.  Two, the en suite basin tap turns on by itself, three something awakens myself by banging the pillow around early hours, and four something or one steels my silver earring left on the chair beside myside of the bed. The landlady described this as the little boy who likes to hide things including her coffee cup!</span>

<span class="acs_name">Rory Jones from Porthcawl</span><br />
<span class="acs_text">Ive lived in Porthcawl all of my life and there are several places I wont even go to they are so creepy. The worst place is definitely Moor Lane and Sker Beach. They are such lovely places with nice scenery but there is a sinister feeling in the air as if something bad has happened.</span>

<span class="acs_text">I worked in The Prince of Wales, the Wetherspoons pub near Cardiff Central, over the summer of 2006, and the upstairs bar is reputedly haunted by a famous actress who died there when it was a theatre. Not sure how true the story is, but I thought for a split second I saw a dark shape, from the corner of my eye, where the food arrives... Anyone ever feel anything?</span>

<span class="acs_name">SJ from Porthcawl</span><br />
<span class="acs_text">At the age of around 14-16 my friends and I used to often go and spend nights by Sker House in the hope of seeing something. And boy did we see something!!! It was on our 3rd trip down there when we had all been snooping close by to the house (sorry if we were tresspassing) but we only managed to get so far as the boundary wall when we could hear this faint wailing noise - it could have been the wind but not too sure but then we seen a faded figure slightly lighted appear from the ruin of the sort of tower closest to the sea. It was enough to make us actually go home that night instead of staying out and after about 11 years I have not been back since. There are from what I have been told sightings at along the rocks between Sker and Kenfig of figures reportedly from the wreck of the Sampamta. Also sightings at The Prince of Wales in Kenfig, the Angel Inn at Maudlam... Grove Farm (opp Grove golf club) is supposed to have a phantom funeral procession in the front garden were the old road once was before the existing road was built. I have bene told hat a very spooky place is Moor Lane at the Nottage side of Porthcawl - not sure if it is haunted or not but I have driven down the lane at night and it really isn't something that I will do again soon - very creepy. Porthcawl is a very mysterious town and have many a tales of hauntings. It is well worth a visit there and spending some time in some of the above mentioned places.</span>

<span class="acs_name">Stephen Parry originally from Rudry near Caerphill</span><br />
<span class="acs_text">Not far from the Maenllwyd Inn are the ruins of a house in which a witch lived in the mid 1800's. She is supposed to have cursed my family. I don't know about that, but on two occasions when I have walked up through the woods to the field where the house was I have seen no one, but when I started to go back someone had left a bunch of flowers on the stile going into the field. This stile is in full view, but I have never seen who did it. Strange!!</span>

<span class="acs_name">Samantha Smith (from Ely)</span><br />
<span class="acs_text">I once got locked in a bedroom where I was living in a house in Splott. There was no catch or lock on the door, and when I tried it, the handle turned but the door would not open.  The door was never shut, as it wouldn't stay shut - having no catch.  I was locked in there for about 10 mins with my boyfriend, and when he tried to open it, his hand started bleeding, but on what - we don't know.  Eventually, I tried the door again, and nearly fell over as it was as easy as a feather. At the time, only the two of us lived in the house. Also, things would go missing, and turn up a few weeks later in the most strange and weird, even dangerous places. I suppose it makes life a bit more unpredictable eh?  </span>

<span class="acs_name">Sally from Aberdare</span><br />
<span class="acs_text">The Conway Inn in Aberdare is haunted. My uncle owns the pub and he told me a woman had hung herself upstairs in the past. He recently went on holiday leaving me 2 look after the place for a month. One night I heard a loud bang coming from the bar and thought I had been broken into but the alarm didn't go off so I thought nothing of it. The next morning I made it to the bar before the cleaner and the chair nearest the main door had been knocked back onto the floor and there were bottles behind the bar that had been hit over. It doesn't bother me but it seems too much of a coincidence. I've been told by people that they can feel something at the top of the stairs by the women's toilets. I would love to find out if there is someone there, or if someone has experienced something. </span>

<span class="acs_text">I went to the catholic school St Albans in Pontypool. The school was home to the Handbury family, and was also during its stead a nunnery. There's a very famous photo of the original grand staircase. The photo is taken in the 80s of some of the pupils standing at the top of the staircase. Just behinde the pupils is an eerie white figure. Whether or not this was a ghost or a pupil trying to scare his classmates (which from the translucent appearance and the era it was taken where computer editing would have been a tricky task it semed a unlikely. The picture links with one of the stories of a phantom presumed to a nun. The tale goes she was walking alone at night down the grand staircase lost her footing and fell breaking her neck in the bannisters on the way to her death. I'd love to know if anyone who has attended or is in St Albans has had any experiences in the main A block building? Or if anyone knows anymore more about the dungeons off the stairs in B block, or more tales from the schools past?</span>

I was enjoying watching it from outside that field but i wanted to join in. As soon as i stepped into that field, everyone stopped and stared at me! Suddenly, everything just disappeared!

<span class="acs_text">Penallta colliery - I've been there many times to take photo's of the beautiful old engine hall, however on one trip I was taking some shots of the pit wheels silhouetted against the sky when I saw a boy in a white shirt waving from the top of one of them.I waved back and took a photo, and carried on snapping away.Around twenty minutes later the lad had still not came down so I shouted up to him.As I did this I realised that the steps to the pit wheel had been removed and the legs were wrapped in barbed wire for the very purpose of stopping people from climbing up - assuming that however he had got up there, the boy must have thought I was going to shout at him for trespassing and was staying still to avoid me.After a while I was quite concerned, butbeing unable to climb up myself I asked some other boys who had turned up if they were missing a friend - No was the reply, and despite my warnings one boy proceeded to climb up the opposite pit wheel, which still had some steps attatched - from his view at the top he reported that the other pit wheel was empty. We checked the surrounding bushes in fear that the boy had fallen, but found nothing.At this point, feeling pretty foolish but insisting the boy had been there, I commented to the lads about losing my marbles and left.I was quite bemused by the event and put it down to the lads playing a trick on me, so you can imagine my bewilderment when the developed photographs showed not only the white shirted boy at the top of the pit wheel, but also at the foot of the same pitwheel, standing in the doorway of the engine hall, and in several shots of the interior of the engine room!My eyesight is perfect, and I still stand my ground that that boy was not there when I took the photos.</span>

<span class="acs_text">I have been to Llancaiach Fawr many times with family and school trips. I also went on a ghost tour halloween night about three years ago with my family and my partner. I have always hated the small room with the single bed and cot in (the birthing room), as I have always felt something there when visiting during the day. As myself and our group of visitors walked in I noticed how cold it was in there. The guide started explaining how the room used to be used when someone or something pulled on my jacket. I just looked at the stranger next to me and thought what are you doing, and then th=urned and carried on listening to the guide. Through all the time he was talking I had this tugging on my jacket. It was only after the tour that I mentioned this to the guide and he just laughed and said 'yeah a lot of people have had that - its just the children playing'. Freaked me right out and I think I scared that innocent stranger next to me with me staring at him thinking it was him tugging my jacket - oooops!</span>

Her father died there from a chest infection and if you go through the house in a certain room you can hear the sound of a man struggling for his breath. Also the Maid of Sker is the daughter of one of the Morgans from many generations ago.  He locked her in a room at the top of the house and ever since she has been seen wandering the dunes and seen around the house as if she's happy to be finally freed.</span>

When she told me that she moved into a new house i thought it was great, but when I actually got to her house, I found out that she was living in a converted school, in the middle of the Welsh countryside. It looked kinda freaky from the outside, but from the inside, it was a warm home ... or so I thought! On the first night, I slept in the very top room of the house, the attic. I was just drifting off to sleep when I heard the sound of children playing. I opened my eyes and there were 4 little girls at the bottom of my bed dancing around in a circle and singing. I totaly freaked because they werent from our era, they looked Victorian!  Freaky, as my nan lives in a converted Victorian school!!</span>

<span class="acs_text">Cyfarhfa Castle is definatley haunted! When I went to school there some 16 or 17 years ago in a rainy lunch hour in a classroom which was allegedly Crawshay's bdroom (how true that is I am not sure) we pretended to conduct a seance (obvioulsy not doing it properly as only 11 at the time and had no experience in these matters!) and we stupidly asked for something to happen that would cause us to have time off school but not to harm anyone or anything. As we requested this the window slammed shut and the board rubber fell on the floor. The very next day the school was closed as a storm had caused some tress to fall on the driveway leading up to the castle. More than a coincidence I would say!!</span>

It ran across to the shoe shop the other side and then straight through the glass doors the restaurant area and over the to the play area before vanishing. When I say she ran through the glass doors... she went THROUGH them without opening. It was quite weird but not spooky!

<span class="acs_text">I visited Llancaich Fawr on a late night ghost walk. It was really freaky but there's no malice in that house at all, except for one room which just feels terribly sad. I had a pain in my leg and the guide then told me that lots of people get leg pains in there and apparently there was a man with a wooden leg who lived there. My friend and I felt really cold blasts of air on our hands and I felt them across my face. We also heard a cry when we were in the childs room. I aslo managed to freak the guide out when we were in the kitchen by saying that I felt pains in my chest and got the feeling of two women sitting next to the fire with blankets over them and making things. She told me that over Christmas, she had been sitting there, wrapped in blankets and she had a very bad asthma attack.I think that people who dismiss it as rubbish should think twice about condemming it!!</span>

I stayed in Room 4 and I was gettin ready in the bathroom and cleaning my teeth, when I heard a knock on my door so I went to open it and as I did I felt a breeze of cold air on the back of my neck! There was  no-one there but I was sure I could see the outline of a person walking down the hall. I shut the door and felt the exact same rush of cold air but this time in my face. All through the night I could hear footsteps on the landing.<p>I told the co owner and she said that that was the ghost of the old owner of the George Inn and she often still walked along the landing. I was also told that I was very lucky to have a glimpse of her because not many people have seen her. But the co owner was lucky enough to see her too and believed every thing I told her!<p>If you're looking for a scary night I recommend there and even if you don't see the ghost it is great fun anyway!</span>

<span class="acs_text">I've been to Wales a fair few times but nothing spooky has ever happened there. But if anyone has ever been to Ingestre Hall, then they'll know of the Blue Staircase. Now the owners use Ingestre Hall for school trips and I went for a music trip. The Blue Staircase is often used for weddings and thats were the bride will walk down. One night after rehersals I was walking past and I saw a lady in a wedding dress at the top. I must have looked embarressed as she smiled. "I'm so sorry I didn't realise there was a wedding going on, I hope I haven't caused any inconvienience." The woman laughed and said not to worry as the wedding had been cancelled. I thought nothing more about it and went off to bed.<p>Next morning at breakfast I asked my teacher if there had been a wedding here last night. He looked at me puzzled and said "What, don't be ridiculous why would they double book. It's all your imagination!" I decided to get a secongd opinion and went to the co-owner. He didn't seem at all surprised by what I told him and said that it was the bride that I had seen on the staircase. He told me that years and years ago, there was going to be a wedding but the bride had slept with the best man. Her fiance had found out and killed her on the stairs in her wedding dress. She only will appear to someone walking by themselves (that's why they had told us to go around in pairs or more) past the staircase. I was a bit freaked out by this but walked past again the next night and saw her again but this time waved smiled and went. The last night when we left I was going back into the house to get my flute and I walked past the staircase. Someone said goodbye to me and I just thought it was the owner or something, but when I turned, the bride was walking up the staircase, she waved at me so I waved back and then she disappeared.<p>I did tell people about this but no one except the owner and co-owner believed me.</span>

<span class="acs_text">Id just like to say right from the start that I'm a very sceptical person, and can't quite rationally understand what happened in my previous house.<p>Myself and my mother had lived in a house in Henfaes Rd in Tonna for 17 years, and had never experienced anything remotely strange nor felt uncomfortable at all. But for a period of around 6 months some strange things occured that are quite hard to explain. When I was 16, myself and my girlfriend were in my bedroom watching tv and eating food, when a tube of my girlfriends lip balm, that was sitting on my desk on the oppostite side of the room, somehow just went through the air and landed in between us. We both saw the object come towards us and land on the bed. It completely freked us out and neither of us could understand what could have made it move. This was the first personal experience that I have had of anything unusual and I still find it hard to conceive how it could have done that.<p>In the following months several similar incidents occured, especially an occasion one night where loud banging noises came from downstairs for a several minutes, (as if someone was trashing our living room), and nothing was out of place when we went down to see what was happening. The noise just suddenly stopped, and nothing at all was moved or misplaced, and all the doors were still locked. To this day I cant imagine what could have created such a realistic and frightening noise. It was as if something was literally downstairs. For a family of sceptical and rational thinkers, it became quite a strange and annoying experience, though gladly one day it just stopped.<p>Its been quite a while now since all this happened, but it would be quite nice to hear from anyone else that experienced similar things. </span>

And trust me he's not the type of guy that "jokes" around about stuff like this!!!!<p>One time in year 7 I was in my music lesson, absolutely bored to death. Then suddenly the whole class heard a thud in the corridor. My teacher went out to check and found nothing. But two boys sat next to me said they saw a flash of black... the nun! And another time my music teacher stayed back late after school and she walked into the other room down the corridor and saw the nun watering the plants. She always comes back now and again to water our plants in the music room. But here's the thing... the plants are dead because she's dead. There's the part that freaks me out. All the time.</span>

<span class="acs_text">St Mary's Church, Ely. Smoke without fire. A graveyard that at first glance is well kept but on looking again is derelict and unkempt. A feeling of not being alone, and knowing that you have outstayed your welcome. Legends of Black Masses and suicidal priests don't really make for a sense of well being, which is a shame as St Mary's sits on an Iron Age hillfort that also has remnants of Norman occupation and is supposedly the convergance point of a number of Ley lines. Perhaps it's connected in some mystical way to other ancient sites such as Tinkinswood which isn't too far from Ely.  For more strange stories surrounding the church check out the South Wales Echo and Western Mail archives. A lot have been recorded. Does anyone know if the fort has ever been excavated and if so where there any finds?</span>

None of my friends have ever seen a ghost, apart from my mom who saw a ghost in her childhood home in Manamansalo. On the same island they say two sons murdered their father. My cousin has a cabin near that place and the forest looks so eerie, even if it was daytime. Also on the same island (Manamansalo is an island) there is an old cemetery which dates back from c.16th century. According to a legend, in the end of 19th century a man dug up some bones he found and fooled around with them. Subsequently a ghost of a big, tall man haunted him for the rest of his life. In Paltaniemi there was also a cemetery. Half of it collapsed to a lake centuries ago and the remains of people were floatingin the lake. The rest of the graves were dug up and the bodies relocated. Only holes remain in the old graveyard. In Kajaani an old mansion called Karolineburg is said to be haunted by a young lady. When a portrait of her was removed from the bedroom a few years ago, mysterious fires appeared out of nowhere. They stopped when the painting was hung back to its old place. People have also felt the presense of someone in the house. Today the Karolineburg is a hotel and you can actually stay in the room if you dare, that is.</span>

<span class="acs_text">I live in a 3 storey semi detatched house with my parents and daughter. Over the years we have had some strange things happen. Footsteps up/down stairs and hallways, plates flying off the drainer, someone playing on the pool table.  My daughter has been badly scratched even though her fingernails are always short - she wants to move as it's freaking her out. Things going missing then turning up in the strangest places. I have been poked in the back and my friend has been knocked on the head. Cupboard doors opening. My dog will not sleep in the house as he cries and barks when in. According to the neighbours a man who lived here before committed suicide. I'm going to the records office to check previous owners of the house then check the names with the death register. Then I might be able to put a name to our non-rent paying guest.</span>

<span class="acs_text">I used to work at Llechwen Hall, Pontypridd, for a number of years. I'd always been told by various people that it had a ghost or two but didn't really believe it until I had an experience there myself. It was the end of my working shift. All rooms upstairs were empty since the all the residents were still in the function room. We were waiting for the room to empty when myself and my colleagues heard tremendously heavy footsteps coming from upstairs. They were so heavy that the door, which was locked, leading from the bar into the function room shook violently in its frame. My first thought was that someone had kicked the door, but this was not the case since there was nobody near the door at the time. My next thought was that someone was running around upstairs. I went to reception to check if anyone had gone upstairs. The owner and 4 other colleagues who were in the reception told me that there was nobody upstairs and that they had heard the footsteps too!!</span>

<span class="acs_text">On the main road between Newport and Risca, there used to be an old derelict house standing alone in fields (now a housing estate). Everytime I passed there I saw a girl at an upstairs window.  She wore a white nightgown and had long black hair. Her arms were outstretched and she appeared to be in distress, pleading for help. I sensed that she was locked in that house and that her end would be unpleasant. My mind's eye told me the period was approx 16th century. I would love to research that old house, but don't know where to start. Also, I can relate to Tomas Cole from Nantyglo and his experience on the Milfraen mountain. I too have had the same experience at the same place.</span>

He turned to me and said "Don't be frightened, I'm not here to scare you"  then stood up and walked out of the room. From then on I still felt a presence but did not see him again. This is the only time this has ever happened to me and was over 20 years ago! - I was not drunk or dreaming!</span>
