            <h2>Dissertation Conventions</h2>
            <p>This style-sheet contains advice about recommended conventions 
              bearing on how to set out the dissertation and to refer to material 
              in notes and the bibliography. These conventions must also be followed 
              in your assessed essays, which you should use, <i>inter alia</i>, 
              to practise presentational skills. Presentation and accuracy are 
              important for more than stylistic reasons. Examiners will be concerned 
              to scrutinise text layout, notes and bibliography in order to form 
              an impression of your research technique.            </p>
            <p>This cannot be a comprehensive guide. If you identify omissions 
              or areas which need clarification, please report them to Robert 
              Bickers so that they may be incorporated into later versions of 
              this booklet. Your comments and suggestions will be very much appreciated.            </p>
            <p>It is important to note that there is no universally accepted series 
              of conventions. Most British academic presses (for example Oxford 
              University Press (OUP), <a href="http://www.cup.cam.ac.uk/information/authors/">Cambridge 
              University Press</a> (CUP) and Blackwell) have their own idiosyncratic 
              rules which cannot always be reconciled (and which they do not always 
              manage to follow consistently from book to book). North American 
              presses are generally more consistent in their conventions, but 
              their annotation tends to be elaborate by British standards: for 
              example, it is necessary to give the publisher of a book as well 
              as the place of publication, and the authors' first names are given 
              in full. So it is best not to follow American usage simply because 
              it increases the amount of information which needs to be recorded 
              and checked. Among the British presses, Blackwell stands out for 
              the clarity and consistency of its annotation system. The recommendations 
              below are substantially based on its practice. The point to emphasise 
              is that you have some latitude in the choice of conventions: <u>internal 
              consistency</u> within the dissertation is what matters above all 
              else.            </p>

            <p><a href="#contents">(Return to Contents)</a> </p>
            <p>In the <u>bibliography</u> books should be cited by their full 
              title (including subtitle, if there is one, after a colon) together 
            with place of publication and date. Thus:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Lewis, Jane, <i>The Politics of Motherhood: Child and Maternal 
                Welfare in England, 1900-1939 </i>(London, 1980).</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> N.B. Underlined text may be used instead of italics, provided 
              of course that your usage is wholly consistent. If you are able 
              to use italics, they do look more professional.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In the <u>notes</u> the first reference to a book should give its 
              full title, place of publication and date, just as it appears in 
              the Bibliography. Note, however, that the initials or given name 
              now come before the surname. Thus:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="style2 style2">Jane Lewis, <i>The Politics of Motherhood: Child and Maternal 
                Welfare in England, 1900-1939</i> (London, 1980).</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>How does one establish what the title actually is? It sometimes 
              happens that there are slightly different versions of the title 
              in various parts of the book. Disregard the dust-jacket (if there 
              is one, of course) and go by the internal title page. This is not 
              the very first page, which usually has just the title on it, but 
              the page which is overleaf. (It will usually have the author's name 
              and the name of the press on it as well.) Follow what this title 
              page says; the only addition which need be made routinely is supplying 
              a colon to separate the title and the subtitle. Look out for minor 
              variations. For example, there is sometimes a comma before the dates 
              at the end of a title, sometimes not.&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
              <li> Volumes with multiple authors: 
                <p class="style2 style2">Jane Lewis, David Clark and David H.J. Morgan, <i>'Whom God 
                  Hath Joined Together': The Work of Marriage Guidance</i> (London, 
                  1992).<br />
                (use the order of authors given on the title page) </p>
              </li>
              <li> Edited volumes:&nbsp; 
                <p class="style2 style2">Jane Lewis (ed.), <i>Lone Mothers in European Welfare Regimes: 
                  Shifting Policy Logics</i> (London, 1997).<br />
                  Jane Lewis, Marilyn Porter and Mark Shrimpton (eds), <i>Women, 
                  Work and Family in the British, Canadian and Norwegian Offshore 
                Oilfields</i> (Basingstoke, 1988).</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><u>After the first reference</u> the title should be abbreviated. 
              A good rule of thumb is that when abbreviating you should:            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Drop the definite or indefinite article if this is the first 
                word of the title.</li>
              <li>Retain all the words up to and including the first noun.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Thus:&nbsp; </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="style2 style2">Lewis, <i>Politics of Motherhood</i>. Lewis <i>et al</i>, <i>'Whom 
                God Hath Joined Together'</i>. Lewis <i>et al</i> (eds), <i>Women, 
                Work and Family</i>.&nbsp; </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>It is not uncommon that an author has produced several works with 
              similar titles. If this is the case, expand the abbreviated reference 
              until you reach the first noun which makes the title you mean unambiguous.&nbsp; 
            </p>
            <p> Short titles are much better than using <i>op. cit.</i> ('the 
              work mentioned'). This can be very confusing because it obliges 
              the reader to trawl back through the earlier notes.&nbsp;</p>
            <p> Similarly, you should be very sparing in the use of <i>ibid.</i> 
              ('the same work') when you find yourself having to refer to the 
              same title in consecutive notes. Only do this when only one title 
              is mentioned in both notes, so that there is no uncertainty about 
              what the 'same work' refers to. If in doubt, do not use ibid. at 
              all; simply repeat shortened titles.&nbsp;</p>
            <p> Avoid <i>id.</i>/<i>ead.</i> ('the same male/female author'). 
              Repeat the name.&nbsp;</p>
            <p> If a book is part of a series it is up to you whether to cite 
              this. Generally speaking, it is not necessary to give series titles 
              if they are not numbered: e.g. Oxford Historical Monographs. If 
              the series is numbered, it can be an awkward decision where to include 
              it without making the whole reference rather cumbersome. One technique 
              is to tuck the series, not italicised, inside the brackets and separated 
              from the place and date by means of a semicolon. Thus:&nbsp;</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>M. Atkins, <i>Informal Empire in Crisis: British Diplomacy and 
                the Chinese Customs Succession, 1927-1929</i> (Cornell East Asia 
                Series, 74; Ithaca, N.Y., 1995). </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> When referring to a multi-volume single work, it is a good idea 
              to give the volume number as a lower-case roman numeral. This prevents 
              any confusion with page references. Thus:&nbsp;</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>J. K. Fairbank, K. F. Bruner and E. M. Matheson (eds), <i>The 
                I. G. in Peking: Letters of Robert Hart, Chinese Maritime Customs 
                1868-1907</i>, 2 vols. (Cambridge, Mass., 1975), i. 6-12, 34-42; 
                ii. 96-100.&nbsp; </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Note two things about this reference:&nbsp; </p>
            <ul>
              <li> the use of the semicolon to separate page numbers in the different 
                volumes</li>
              <li> the use of a full point rather than a comma between the volume 
                number and the first page extent - this looks better when there 
                is a juxtaposition of lower-case roman numerals and arabic numerals.&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
            <p> When abbreviating book titles, use acronym-type abbreviations 
              very sparingly. Only do so if the title is referred to very often.&nbsp;</p>
            <p> To discover the place of publication of a book, use the internal 
              title page and the page which gives details of, <i>inter alia</i>, 
              the ISBN number. The place of publication is <u>not</u> necessarily 
              the same as the place where the book was set and/or printed. If 
              two or more places of publication are given, confine your reference 
              to the first place mentioned: this applies even if one of the other 
              places is in the UK. So, University of Chicago Press = Chicago and 
              London = for our purposes Chicago. To avoid confusing Cambridge 
              (USA), home of Harvard University Press, and Cambridge (UK), home 
              of Cambridge University Press, the state in which Cambridge (USA) 
              is located is added to the place of publication. Thus:&nbsp;</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>J. K. Fairbank, K. F. Bruner and E. M. Matheson (eds), <i>The 
                I. G. in Peking: Letters of Robert Hart, Chinese Maritime Customs 
                1868-1907</i>, 2 vols. (Cambridge, Mass., 1975).&nbsp; </p>

			<h3><a name="harvard" id="harvard"></a>The Harvard System </h3>
            <p>There is another convention for bibliographies and notes which 
              is sometimes known as the Harvard System. Here the title in the 
              <u>bibliography</u> is listed in the form:&nbsp; Hennessy, Peter. 
              1992. <i>Never Again: Britain, 1946-51</i>. London.&nbsp; All references 
              in the <u>notes</u>, including the first, then become: Hennessy 
              1992, 23-7.&nbsp; If an author has produced more than one item in 
              the same year, the works are distinguished by lower-case letters 
              immediately after the date, with no spacing. Thus: Hennessy 1992a, 
              27.&nbsp; It is also possible to insert Harvard System references 
              into the body of the text, where you might otherwise use a footnote, 
              placing the citation in brackets. For example:&nbsp; ...Its flaws 
              have become familiar (Bose 1990a, 36-8; Cooper et al. 1990, 1-9)... 
              The advantage of the Harvard System is that it is very neat. The 
              disadvantage is that it makes footnotes look rather bleak, or else 
              it breaks up the text, and it obliges the reader to refer constantly 
              to the bibliography, whereas with the normal method one tells the 
              reader what the full title is and then provides constant reminders 
            by means of abbreviated titles.&nbsp; </p>
            <p><a href="#contents">(Return to Contents)</a> </p>
            <h3><a name="articles" id="articles"></a>Articles</h3>
            <p>In the case of articles, it is the title of the journal which must 
            be italicised/underlined. Thus <u>in the notes</u>: </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>W. R. Louis, 'Hong Kong: the Critical Phase, 1945-1949', <i>American 
                Historical Review</i>, 102 (1997), 1052-84.&nbsp; <br />
                Christopher Thorne, 'Racial Aspects of the Far Eastern War of 
                1941-45, <i>Proceedings of the British Academy</i>, 66 (1980), 
              329-77.&nbsp; </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Note the position of the commas and the use of <u>single</u> inverted 
              commas. Double inverted commas are reserved for quotation marks 
              within the title: e.g.:&nbsp; </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Robert A. Bickers, '&quot;Coolie work&quot;: Sir Reginald Johnston at the 
                School of Oriental Studies, 1931-1937', <i>Journal of the Royal 
                Asiatic Society</i>, Series III, 5 (1995), 385-401.&nbsp; </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> Like book references the order of author surname/given name in 
              the citation is different in bibliographies. The entry <u>in the 
              bibliography</u> will read:&nbsp;</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Louis, W. R., 'Hong Kong: the Critical Phase, 1945-1949', <i>American 
                Historical Review</i>, 102 (1997), 1052-84.&nbsp; </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p> When the title of a journal starts with the definite article, 
              this is not reproduced. So <i>English Historical Review</i>, not 
              <i>The English Historical Review</i>.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>For articles in edited collections:&nbsp;</p>
            <blockquote>

                History: Practice and Method</i> (Oxford, 1988), 70-88.&nbsp; 
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Abbreviated as: </p>

            <p> If there are two or more editors use (eds.).&nbsp;</p>
            <p> Some journals list the titles of their articles with no upper-case 
              letters other than the beginning of the first word and, of course, 
              proper nouns. Here you have a choice. <u>Either</u> scrupulously 
              follow the conventions of each particular journal <u>or</u> standardise 
              by having capital letters throughout. On balance, the second method 
              is preferable because otherwise the notes can appear uneven.&nbsp;</p>
            <p> It is impossible to provide unambiguous rules about the use of 
              capitals in titles. The general rule is that important words take 
              a capital. You will not go far wrong if you use a capital for the 
              following:&nbsp;nouns, adjectives, adverbs and most verbs.&nbsp; 
              The following do <u>not</u> take a capital:&nbsp; conjunctions, 
              prepositions, verbs expressing a state (esp. 'to be'), modal verbs 
              (e.g. 'might', 'should', 'could'), pronouns, and the (in)definite 
              article.&nbsp; The first letter of the first word of a title is 
              always a capital.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Works referred to frequently may conveniently be cited by an abbreviation, 
              provided a List of Abbreviations is included at the beginning of 
            the dissertation. Thus:&nbsp;</p>
            <blockquote>

            <p>You will become familiar with the journals and series that crop 
              up regularly in your chosen subject area: look at the List of Abbreviations 
              in the books you use. </p>
            <p> Be fairly sparing with abbreviations. A good rule of thumb is 
              that a journal may be abbreviated if you have references to three 
              or more different articles appearing in it.&nbsp;</p>
            <p> One- or two-word journal titles should not be abbreviated. So, 
              <i>Contemporary History </i>does not become <i>CH</i>, nor <i>Albion 
              A.</i>&nbsp;</p>
            <p> You may also conveniently cite abbreviations for organisations 
              referred to frequently in the text, provided that they are included 
              in the List of Abbreviations. It is customary and helpful to name 
              the organisation in full the first time it is referred to, and indicate 
              the abbreviation to be used.&nbsp;</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>'The Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) had had a police force 
                since 1854, and as over the years it had arrogated to itself more 
                powers, and more land, so the Shanghai Municipal Police (SMP) 
              had become a more and more important instrument of control.'&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Here conventions vary because of the wide variety of documentation 
              preserved in many different places. Most archives will have guidelines 
              available indicating the conventions they prefer, or will be able

            you are studying.&nbsp;</p>
            <p> The general rule is that manuscript material is cited by city

            <h3><a name="pageextents" id="pageextents"></a>Page Extents</h3>
            <p>It is not necessary to preface page references with 'p.' or 'pp.', 
              though you may do so. But when material is not conventionally paginated, 
              you should draw attention to this by means of, for example, 'col.'/'cols.' 
            for column(s).&nbsp;</p>
            <p> Be precise in giving page extents. Avoid <i>passim</i> ('throughout 
              the work'/'everywhere') because it looks lazy and leads the examiner 
              to wonder whether you have read the work carefully. Similarly, avoid 
              <i>et seq</i>. ('and what follows'). Equally unsatisfactory are 
              'f.' ('and the next few pages') and 'ff.' ('and the following pages') 
              after a page reference.&nbsp;</p>
            <p> You should take care to provide meaningful page extents in your 
              notes. One sometimes reads a sentence advancing a broad proposition 
              which is supported by a reference to only one or two pages of secondary 
              work. This is inadequate. You should refer to the whole run of pages 
              where the point you are making is discussed. And you should try 
              to refer to more than one work: important points made on the back 
              of just one book or article look rather thin.&nbsp;</p>
            <p> When giving page extents some contraction is preferable. (But 
              see below about roman numerals.) The general rule is that one counts 
              from the units up through the tens, hundreds etc. until there is 
              no repetition. Thus:&nbsp;</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>147-149 = 147-9 147-168 = 147-68 147-213 = 147-213&nbsp; </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>There is one slight exception to this rule: page extents involving 
              teens keep the tens figure.&nbsp; Thus: </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>113-117, not 113-7.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>This is easy to remember because page extents are written virtually 
              as they are pronounced, and 'one hundred and thirteen-to-seven' 
              is ridiculous.&nbsp; </p>
            <p> When referring to roman-numeral page extents (for example in an 
              introduction or preface), use lower case: e.g. xxii-xxiv. Note that 
              the arabic equivalent 22-24 should be expressed as 22-4 whereas 
              roman numerals cannot be shortened; xxii-iv is impossible.&nbsp;</p>

            <h3><a name="bibliogarrange" id="bibliogarrange"></a>Arrangement of the Bibliography</h3>
            <p>The Bibliography should be split into either two or three parts 
            depending on the types of primary material you have used:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Primary Manuscript Sources </li>
              <li>Primary Printed Sources </li>
              <li>Secondary Works (note that the term 'Secondary Sources' is a 
                solecism) </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Or: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Primary Sources </li>
              <li>Secondary Works&nbsp; </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Primary sources are listed alphabetically by location.&nbsp; Printed 
              sources are also listed alphabetically.&nbsp; The listing of secondary 
              works is quite straightforward. Go alphabetically by author.&nbsp; 
            </p>
            <p> When listing several works by one author, you should list them 
              by date, starting with the first to be published.</p>
            <p> If a work is anonymous, or if one is dealing with a collection 
              of sources where there is no imputed authorship (e.g. a collection 
              of documents), it is listed alphabetically by the title. Ignore 
              definite/indefinite articles. Thus <i>Documents on British Foreign 
              Policy</i> would be listed under the letter <u>D</u>. And <i>The 
              Yi Ho Tuan Movement of 1900</i> under the letter <u>Y</u>.&nbsp;</p>

            <h3><a name="quotations" id="quotations"></a>Quotations</h3>
            <p>Long quotations (two sentences or more) should be rendered as a 
            block of text indented on both the left- and right-hand margins.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The normal way to preface an indented quotation is with a colon.&nbsp; 
              No punctuation is used, however, if the quotation runs grammatically 
              from the immediately preceding portion of text.&nbsp; </p>
            <p> Inverted commas are <u>not</u> used around indented quotations.&nbsp;</p>
            <p> With shorter quotations use <u>SINGLE</u> inverted commas. Double 
              inverted commas are only used when a quotation appears within another. 
              Thus:&nbsp;</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>He first wrote, 'I heard the minister say &quot;What!&quot;'. </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h3><a name="misc" id="misc"></a>Miscellaneous Points</h3>
            <p>Different works are separated in notes by a semicolon. &nbsp;Romance-language 
              (French, Spanish, Italian) titles seldom use capitals other than 
              for the first word and proper nouns. If capitals are not used, they 
              should not be supplied. Note that this advice is contrary to the 
              conventions of the CUP and OUP, which insist that Romance titles 
              take capitals up to and including the first noun; this system makes 
              notes look lop-sided and should be avoided. &nbsp;For spelling conventions 
              (e.g. <i>ise</i> or <i>ize</i>, <i>erred</i> or <i>ered</i>) as 
              well as for much else, you should consult <i>The Oxford Writers' 
              Dictionary</i>, comp. R. E. Allen, which is widely available in 
              paperback (Oxford Reference). This is an invaluable book. See also 
              <i>Fowler's Modern English Usage</i>, ed. R. W. Burfield, another 
              paperback in the Oxford Reference series. &nbsp;<i>Hart's Rules 
              for Compositors and Readers at the University Press Oxford</i> (39th 
              edn.) is very useful too, but be warned that it uses OUP conventions 
            which sometimes depart from what is recommended here. </p>
            <ul>
              <li> Be alert to the fact that some American university names are 
                <u>not</u> the place of publication. Thus Yale = New Haven; Harvard 
                = Cambridge, Mass.; Cornell = Ithaca, NY. But Princeton = Princeton.&nbsp;</li>
              <li> Do <u>not</u> rely solely on the spellcheck facility of your 
                software. It can mangle proper nouns and more often than not uses 
                American spellings. <u>Beware</u> also the auto-correct function: 
                in the first draft of these guidelines <i>EHR</i> was routinely 
                corrected to <i>HER</i>.<i>&nbsp;</i></li>
              <li> The superscript numbers of notes appear <u>after</u> the punctuation. 
                Thus .1 ;2 ,3 and so on.&nbsp;</li>
              <li> Translations of foreign terms should be give in the text in 
                brackets after their first appearance.</li>
            </ul>
