        is Tuna and Shark. I eat poultry more than beef. The types of food I do like are

        don't drink soda as much as I used to but Cherry Pepsi or Cherry Coke is

        <p><b><font face="verdana, arial" size="2">Music:</font></b> 
        <font color="#004182" face="verdana, arial" size="2">I love trance but I
        enjoy listening to male singers/bands more often then the female singers.
        I like most styles of music except I rarely fall for classical, opera or
        jazz. If I had to name bands here, it would be ones like Coldplay, Rage 
        Against the Machine, 3 
        Doors Down, Newsboys, Audio Adrenaline, Creed, P.O.D, Linkin Park
        and Nickelback.&nbsp;</font></p>

        enjoy too many! Action movies rock and romantic puppy love movies are on 
        the hit list right now. However, I totally fell in love with Lord of the 
        Rings </font></font>
        <font face="verdana, arial" size="2" color="#004182">series.</font></p>
        <p><b><font face="verdana, arial" size="2">Favorite Actors:</font></b> 
        <font color="#004182" face="verdana, arial" size="2">Edward
        Norton, Jude Law, Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom. There are other actors
        I like for their character though. Like Nicholas Cage is great at acting and so
        forth.&nbsp;Although I have to admit, I have only liked Val Kilmer for
        his lips.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><b><font face="verdana, arial" size="2">Books:</font></b> 
        <font color="#004182" face="verdana, arial" size="2">Well
        my last book was about a dog breed on Pembroke Welsh Corgis. I was going
        to buy a puppy but I am going to hold off now. College and work is going
        to ruin any training time for a puppy right now. Although, one of my
        buddies has been trying to get my into these fantasy dragon books so I
        may start reading a lot more again. I also need to buy the Lord of the
        Rings set soon.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><b><font face="verdana, arial" size="2">Sports: </font> </b><font color="#004182" size="2" face="verdana, arial">Not
        really into sports like my guy friends. I occasionally enjoy watching
        Football, Hockey games (live ones are fun), and racing (Nascar).&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="verdana, arial"><b>Flowers:</b> <font color="#004182">When
        I worked in a floral department (for a few years) I used to get asked
        what type of flower was my favorite over and over and over again. I'd
        always try to change the subject when I could tell the guy was single.
        Hehe. Finally I'd have to tell them because some guys are smarter than
        others. So I might as well spill the beans here. I am not a rose person.
        I think they are pretty but when it comes down to it if I do get one
        single rose it seems more valuable to me than having a dozen. Two seems
        more like a connection with you and the person you love. I used to get
        one single rose from a guy I dated last year. It seemed so much more
        thoughtful than a bouquet. I got so much more excited than I would with
        more than one. I wonder why? He normally gave them to me when I wasn't
        expecting it... but they were also never red... he'd give me yellow or
        pink. When I would see red roses from men before it just didn't hit the
        heart. I think that sounds odd because every woman loves a rose. So down
        to my favorites... I absolutely love Lilies. There are different types
        that are gorgeous but even the regular hybrid colored ones just shine in
        brilliance. Then last but not least are the silver roses. Those have a
        hint of a blue lavender look but the smell can just melt a girl.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="verdana, arial"><font size="2"><b>Scent: </b><font color="#004182">The
        smell of Silver roses and watermelon or vanilla type of scents. But </font></font><font SIZE="2" color="#004182">my
        favorite of all is a Men's Cologne: Acqua Di Gio by Giorgio Armani&nbsp;</font></font></p>
        <p><b><font face="verdana, arial" size="2">Favorite Colors:</font></b><font face="verdana, arial" size="2">&nbsp;<font color="#004182">Many
        different kinds of Blues have always been my favorite (lets just say
        turquoise and teals could be thrown in here too... yes I am allowed to
        cheat when it comes to colors). Forest Green (the
        color of my truck) and Purple have been the recent colors that have
        caught my eyes lately though.</font></font></p>
