<p>By Meghan Wood

<p>CANADIAN justice minister Irwin Cotler tabled legislation to allow <a
href=../cgi-bin/na.cgi?nationalupdates/050126oppose>same-sex
marriage</a>
in the House of Commons Tuesday.

<p>If passed, <a
href=http://www.parl.gc.ca/legisinfo/index.asp?Lang=E&Chamber=C&StartList=2&EndList=200&Session=13&Type=0&Scope=I&query=4381&List=toc>Bill
C-38</a> would redefine marriage as a "union between two persons." As a
result, consequential amendments would also have to be made to the
Canada
Business Corporations Act, the Civilian War-related Benefits Act, the
Divorce Act and the Income Tax Act.

<p>"What will be the social effects of refashioning a fundamental social
institution -- to marriage itself, to spouses, children and society?"
responded Bruce Clemenger, president of the <a
href=http://www.evangelicalfellowship.ca/social/marriage.asp>Evangelical
Fellowship of Canada</a> (EFC). "It is a sad day when the language of
husband and wife is removed from federal legislation. Is this what
Canadians want? It is a distorted notion of tolerance and respect that
eclipses this distinctive relationship."

<p>If the bill is passed, the Liberal government would not use the
Constitution's notwithstanding clause to preserve the current
definition
of marriage, as between two people of the opposite sex. The
notwithstanding clause allows the government to create laws that will
operate in spite of some Charter rights that the laws appear to
violate.
Though these declarations last only five years, they can be re-enacted
indefinitely.

<p><a href=http://www.fotf.ca/familyfacts/takeaction/061203.html>Focus on
the
Family Canada</a> president <a href="http://www.canadianchristianity.com/cgi-bin/na.cgi?nationalupdates/050202new">Terence
Rolston</a> said "there will be consequences" if the legislation goes
through. "If passed, [this] experiment will be on the backs of our
children," he said. "But God puts our governments into power and he is
sovereign over them. I believe in the power of prayer. Now's the time
for
Canadian voices to be heard in the democratic process."

<p>Foreign affairs minister Pierre Pettigrew has said that churches and
other
faith-based organizations should not intervene in matters of government
and that Canadians need to "distinguish between civil and religious
marriage."

<p>Responding to Pettigrew's remarks, Rolston said, "How marriage is
recognized is important as to how society values the institution of
marriage. The law should underline and support the institution that God
ordained. It is a covenant."

<p>Janet Epp Buckingham, director of law and public policy at EFC, said
more
than 75 percent of marriages in Canada are performed by clergy.

<p>"It is clearly a deeply religious constitution," she explains. "It is
naive and impossible to say that you can change civil marriage without
it
having an impact on religious marriage and religious institutions."

<p>Gilles Marchildon, executive director of Egale Canada, a gay and
lesbian
rights group, said it is a "dangerous blurring of the lines" between
church and state "when any faith wants its view of the world and its
view
for its own institutions imposed on society at large."

<p>But Rolston disagreed. "This is one of the most significant issues to
hit
the government in the past 30 years. We do live in a free and
democratic
country. We have the opportunity to vote and be involved in the
democratic
process. We shouldn't neglect the freedom of speaking out here for the
truth of God's word, proclaiming it to those in authority."

<p>Bill C-38 does state that "officials of religious groups are free to
refuse to perform marriages that are not in accordance with their
religious beliefs." However, since only provincial governments have the
authority to legislate protection of religious freedom to the
solemnization of marriage, Buckingham said this issue is "a political
football" being tossed between the federal and provincial governments.

<p>"We have not seen any action by the provincial governments to protect
religious freedom," she says. "Churches and religious institutions are
being set up for endless court cases."

<p>The Vancouver Chinese Evangelical Ministerial Fellowship, representing
95
Chinese Christian churches that includes 25,000 individuals, released a
declaration opposing the bill January 28.

<p>The declaration stated that "changing the tradition of marriage in the
manner proposed by the Federal Government goes against the intention of
God's creation and it runs counter to the moral traditions deeply held
by
Chinese and people from other ethnic backgrounds . . . the government
has
no right to ignore the will of the people in order to be politically
correct."

system
was fundamentally changed by the adoption of the Charter of Rights and
Freedoms. Before that time, Parliament and the provinces, acting
pursuant
to the jurisdiction granted under the British North America Act of
1867,
were legislatively supreme. Although the courts did have the authority
to
strike down legislation, their right to do so extended only to
situations
in which a particular legislature strayed into the jurisdiction

was lost on him. The Liberal Cabinet having just returned from a
lengthy
Asian tour, Foreign Minister Pierre Pettigrew announced that religious
leaders should not involve themselves in the gay marriage debate. The
Prime Minister had just been chatting up the gay marriage issue in
India
and China. The government enthusiastically wants to talk about gay
marriage, even overseas, but thinks that Canadians should shut up about
it
at home. Or more to the point of Mr. Pettigrew's remarks, that Catholic
bishops should keep silent. "I find that the separation of church and
the
state is one of the most beautiful inventions of modern times," said
Mr.
Pettigrew. The authoritarians of China do not find the invention quite
so
fetching; their aesthetic judgment favours a different modern invention
--
communism. And they have more effective ways of silencing their
bishops:
