    Home Your Newly Adopted Rescue Chesapeake Bay Retriever</strong></font></p>
      <p><small><font face="Arial">First things first - <strong><em>CONGRATULATIONS</em></strong>!!!
    We are all so happy that you chose to help a Chessie in need and were willing to open your
    home and hearts to this Brown Dog! </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Arial">The theme of this information packet is &quot;<b>SET YOUR DOG
    UP TO SUCCEED</b>!&quot; By understanding your new dog's behavior - you can anticipate
    problems and correct them calmly and as quickly as possible. Be reasonable in your
    expectations. We want the adoption of your Chessie to be a &quot;win-win&quot; situation
    on both sides!</font></small></p>
      <i><b><p><small><font face="Arial">Before you pick up your new Chesapeake Bay Retriever</b></i><br>
    Since you've chosen to adopt a Chesapeake Bay retriever, you've probably educated yourself
    about 1) the <a href="../warning.htm">reasons this breed is <b>unique</b></a> (American bred
    retriever, not related to Goldens and Labradors), 2) the breed's <a href="behavior.htm"><b>behavior
    characteristics</b></a> (intensely loyal, protective, sensitive and serious) and 3) <b>changes</b>
    to your current lifestyle that this Chessie will cause (time set aside daily for exercise
    and <b>work</b>, either obedience or retrieving). The Chesapeake Bay Retriever Relief
    &amp; Rescue website (<a href="http://www.cbrrescue.org"><b>www.cbrrescue.org</b></a>) has
    information about the uniqueness of this breed, Chessie behavior and dog ownership that
    you might want to read and review.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Arial">The adoption coordinator that you worked with told you about
    your Chessie's history, veterinary information, evaluations and current eating, sleeping
    and activity routines so that his transition into your home can be easier. Dogs need order
    and are extremely <b>routine oriented</b>. We recommend that you find out all you can
    about his routine - and duplicate what you can - <i>before</i> you start to re-orient him
    to the rhythms and schedules of your home. Work out your <b>house rules</b> and dog-care
    regimen in advance among the human members of your household. Who will walk the dog first
    thing in the morning? Who will feed him at night? Will Chessie be allowed on the couch or
    bed? Where will he sleep at night? Will he be crated?</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Arial">To ensure a smooth transition, you will already have <b>supplies</b>
    (collar, ID tag, leash, food, bowls, crate and toys) for your Chessie. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Arial">Try and arrange the arrival of your new dog for a weekend -
    or when you can be home for a few days - for <b>quality, hands-on time</b>. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Arial">If you have <b>resident pets</b>, make sure they are
    up-to-date on their shots and in general good health before bringing home your new dog.
    Despite the best efforts of the rescue organization, previous owner or foster family,
    viruses can be spread and occasionally go home with adopted rescue dogs. You may wish to
    set up an appointment with your own vet to check out your new dog and set up an
    inoculation schedule, depending on the veterinary care your rescue dog has received. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Arial">Register for an <b>obedience class</b>. Don't ignore this
    very important step in setting yourself and your rescued Chessie up for success! Be dogged
    about finding an obedience class or trainer. There are many positive reinforcement-based
    dog obedience classes that teach dog manners, canine good citizenship and discipline. Try
    to register for a class starting about 3 to 4 weeks <strong>after</strong> your dog has
    come home with you. It is important that your new dog has some time to adjust to you and
    your home <em>before</em> putting him into the stimulating environment of an obedience
    class. Even the shortest &quot;dog manners&quot; course offered at your vet's will
    reinforce the new bond between you and your new Chessie, will give you a valuable
    face-to-face resource for questions about your dog's behavior, and will provide a powerful
    tool for moderating your rescue dog's less attractive behavior traits! Remember, Chessies
    need work - this is a really easy way to provide him with active, mental work that you'll
    approve of! The rewards are obvious - what a joy it is to have a well-mannered, trained
    Chessie companion!</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Arial">New families often ask about <b>changing the adopted dog's
    name</b>. If you desire to, it is fine. Many times, the dogs are given names at random by
    a shelter. The dog will learn his new name if it's overused in the beginning. It is in no
    way traumatic to the dog to change his name.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Arial"><i><b>When you arrive home...</b></i></font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Arial"><em><strong><u>Things to expect:</u> </strong></em><br>
    You should expect your new dog to act differently than how he did when you met him at the
    foster/owner's home. He will be excited, nervous and maybe tired after the trip to your
    house. Being routine-oriented, your Chessie may have just gotten comfortable at his foster
    home and now recognizes that the routine is changing yet again. He doesn't know the
    smells, the sounds, and importantly, the routines and rules of your house. This is very
    confusing for your Chessie.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Arial">Dogs display <b>anxiety and nervousness</b> by: panting,
    pacing, lack of eye contact, &quot;not listening,&quot; housebreaking accidents, excessive
    chewing, gastric upset (vomiting, diarrhea, loose stools), crying, whining, jumpiness and
    barking. This is a litany of behaviors any and every dog owner dreads! As long as you
    understand where these behaviors originate, you can perhaps address them <i>before</i>
    they appear and deal effectively when they do! Your goal in the next weeks is to reduce
    the &quot;noise &amp; confusion in his head&quot; and get him to relax, to be calm and
    show him how to be good. Despite your joy at adopting this Chessie (and after a few
    enthusiastic hugs and kisses), you should be calm and gentle and firm with your Chessie.
    Talk to him in a calm, low voice as you travel home - avoid playing the car radio and
    having too many people with you when you pick him up.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Arial">All rescue dogs go through a &quot;honeymoon period.&quot;
    After the first day or so, the dog may be very quiet and extraordinarily controlled and
    &quot;good.&quot; The &quot;real&quot; dog appears two to four weeks later - after he's
    mostly figured out the house rules, the schedule of the days, and the characters of his
    new family. At this time, he'll start testing out his position in the pack, and may
    &quot;regress&quot; to puppyhood behaviors and &quot;bad&quot; behavior. Be patient with
    him, firm in your expectations, praise him for appropriate behavior - especially when he
    is lying quietly and behaving himself. Don't praise for nothing constantly - the dog will
    learn to tune out your praise over time!</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Arial"><u><strong><em>Things to Do: </em></strong></u></font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Arial"><b>LEASH YOUR DOG TO INTRODUCE HIM TO YOUR HOME!</b><br>
    When you <b>first</b> bring your new dog home, make sure you have her on a leash! Spend
    the first 15-30 minutes walking her outside around the perimeter of your yard or the area
    that you will be with her most on your property. Walk slowly - let her &quot;lead&quot;
    mostly - and let her sniff and pause if she wants to. She is getting used to the &quot;lay
    of the land&quot; and all the smells associated with her new home. She will undoubtedly
    relieve herself - this is her way of making herself at home by adding her mark to the
    smells of your home, and now her new home. Obviously you want this to happen outside! If
    you have a place you wish this to happen, encourage her to &quot;get busy&quot; in that
    area and praise her warmly when she does. The excitement of the move and new family will
    cause her to have to <b>relieve herself more often than normal</b>. You must be prepared
    to give her plenty of opportunities to do this in the beginning! Whenever the rescue dog
    is not confined, supervise her - set this dog up to win!</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Arial">You might want to consider isolating the new dog from your
    resident dogs during the first entry to your home - he will appreciate safe and quiet at
    first as he explores your home. Crate your resident dog or have someone take him for a
    walk while your new dog explores.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Arial">Let the new dog explore the house - leave her on leash and
    make sure she's supervised AT ALL TIMES! We recommend leaving your new dog on leash in the
    house for the first day. Don't even leave the dog unsupervised while you answer the phone!</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Arial">Once inside your house, a male may still accidentally mark a
    door, plant or chair when he first walks inside your home. This is out of nervousness (or
    he may smell another dog), so it is best to leave him on the leash indoors the first day.
    If he starts to lift his leg, give him a short jerk on the leash and tell him
    &quot;No,&quot; that should stop him immediately and remind him of his housebreaking
    manners. Follow up this correction by taking him outside in case he's not just marking!
    Bear in mind that if your Chessie has a few accidents, it does not necessarily mean that
    he is not housebroken. We can't emphasize enough how much nerves and excitement can cause <b>uncharacteristic
    accidents</b>. Watch for typical pre-piddling behavior - circling, sniffing, etc. Do not
    scold or hit a dog for having an accident - rather, verbally get his attention, grab the
    leash, and take him right outside to his spot to do his business. If he does it, praise
    him! Once he relaxes and learns the rhythms and routines of your home, all his manners
    will return!</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Arial">Even in a fenced yard, you'll want to leave your rescued
    Chessie on leash for the first week or so. This way, you can reinforce a recall command
    and help monitor pack behavior if you have other dogs. Until your new dog bonds to you and
    makes good eye contact, we recommend leaving her on leash.</font></small></p>
      <b><p><small><font face="Arial">PROVIDE QUIET TIME!</b><br>
    Quiet time will be important for your new Chessie in the first week. Because of his
    nervousness and anxiety, he will get worn out fast. His recent past may include a shelter
    stay which has worn him out with worry. Despite your excitement, try and resist inviting
    friends and relatives over to visit him. Give him time to get used to your immediate
    family and resident pets only. If the dog does not solicit play or attention from you, let
    him alone to sleep or establish himself. Believe it or not, we don't want you to force him
    to play at first! </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Arial"><b>FEED YOUR NEW DOG!</b><br>
    Feed your new dog twice a day; half in the morning, half at night. Ask and encourage the
    dog to sit before putting the bowl down. Put the food bowl down for 15 minutes. If the dog
    does not eat her food, pick up the bowl until the next mealtime. After a couple of days of
    this routing, even the most finicky of eaters will change their minds. Feeding this way
    you can monitor exactly how much she is eating.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Arial">If you have <b>other dogs</b>, feed your rescue dog away from
    them but at the same time. You can feed in the same room, but use opposite corners,
    putting the dominant dog's bowl down first. This is usually the resident dog on the first
    few nights - but that situation may change over time! You may want to arrange having
    another adult in the room for the first week of feedings to monitor the &quot;pack
    behavior.&quot; Watch that each dog sticks to his own bowl. Keep vigilant over feeding
    time for a couple of months until the pack positions are worked out.</font></small></p>
      <b><p><small><font face="Arial">CONSIDER CRATING YOUR DOG!</b><br>
    Many of the Chessies that pass through rescue have been crate trained at one time or
    another. Every dog needs a place to escape to, a place to call his own, and a crate
    provides an answer to these needs! Your new Chessie will have some degree of separation
    anxiety when you leave him for work or alone at home. Crating the dog in the beginning
    will eliminate accidents, chewing destruction, and other mischievous activity that is
    rooted in nervousness and insecurity. Your dog is safest in the crate when you are not
    home until you can totally trust him loose in the house. This is especially true if you
    have resident pets because you can't supervise their interactions when you're away or
    asleep! Children should be taught to leave the dog alone if he retreats to his crate. You
    should never use the crate for disciplining. The crate must be a dog's sanctuary for crate
    training to be effective. Crates are great for traveling with your dog later - the dog
    will always have a familiar den to retreat to and feel comfortable and reassured.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Arial">Each time your dog is confined, make sure the dog knows she's
    a good girl. If the Chessie is particularly emotional or anxious, try making good byes and
    hellos as unemotional &amp; nonchalant as possible. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Arial">While crating a dog helps make everybody safe, crating should
    NOT be abused by locking the dog in the crate all the time. Chessies need to be with you
    and should be with you unless they cannot be supervised or trusted alone in the house. For
    instance, if you are going to shower and the dog still sometimes chews, crate him for
    those 15 minutes for safety, but then let him out to be with you. If the dog is crated
    while you are work all day - you MUST make an extra effort to let the dog &quot;hang&quot;
    with you in the house until he is reliable loose in the house.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Arial">If you prefer not to crate, make sure to set aside a safe,
    indestructible space in your home for your rescue dog. You may want to try using baby
    gates in the kitchen or hallway. Remember, you may really want to keep your dog on easy
    cleanup flooring at first!! If the area of confinement is too large, you may begin to have
    housebreaking accidents. We do not recommend the basement or garage, since your dog will
    not feel &quot;part of the family&quot; isolated away from it. If he can see and hear you,
    much the better. This is why wire style crates are so effective in the house.</font></small></p>
      <b><p><small><font face="Arial">BE PATIENT DURING THE HONEYMOON PERIOD!</b><br>
    There is a good chance that your rescued Chessie will show his insecurity by following you
    everywhere! This will include trying to hang with you in the bathroom, watching TV with
    you, getting the mail, and undoubtedly wanting to sleep with you. It is not unusual for
    him to whine or cry or bark if confined away from you at night - lights out at a new
    strange place is a stressful thing for him. If you put the crate close to your bedroom or
    somewhere he can see you, the problems are usually minimized. Safe chew toys in the crate
    at night will give him something to do if he's awake. Remember, during the first couple of
    weeks, the dog will probably get quite tired and worn out by the day's activities, so
    establishing a sleep schedule is usually not a big deal. As you wean him from the crating
    at night, make sure he has been well exercised - a tired Chessie is usually a really good
    Chessie indoors!!</font></small></p>
      <b><p><small><font face="Arial">ESTABLISH A ROUTINE!</b><br>
    Try to develop <i>and use </i>a consistent daily routine for feeding, exercising, and
    bathroom duties. Dogs are creatures of habit and routine translates into security for
    them. If you do the same things in the same way and in the same order, he will settle in
    more quickly and learn what is expected of him and when.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Arial">Let your new Chessie out to air and take care of business as
    soon as you rise in the mornings. Feed him after a short walk or romp in the yard. Give
    him another chance to relieve himself before you go to work. Upon return from work,
    immediately let the dog out for exercise and bathroom break (this is NOT the time to read
    the mail, make a phone call or flop yourself on the sofa!!!). If he's exercised heavily,
    wait 30 minutes or so before the evening feeding. He'll need another bathroom break
    anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours after the evening meal, depending on his age -
    it'll be your job to figure this out. He should get another airing right before you go to
    bed.</font></small></p>
      <b><p><small><font face="Arial">SOCIALIZE YOUR RESCUED CHESSIE!</b><br>
    Rescue dogs come from a variety of backgrounds, but all dogs can do with more
    socialization. After your dog has time to settle in your home and is starting to look to
    you with confidence (2-3 weeks), start providing new socialization opportunities. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Arial">Now you can start inviting your friends and relatives over.
    Do introductions to new people gradually. Introductions can take the form of petting,
    playing fetch, even going for a walk. <b>Do not force the dog to accept new people</b> -
    do it positively, with lots of praise, allowing the dog to approach people rather than new
    people approaching your dog!!! Be sure to tell your visitors that your dog is new from
    rescue so they need to be more sensitive. Don't reach for the dog right away - let him
    come to them. If he does not go to the new person, that visitor should completely ignore
    the dog. Suggest after the dog has met/sniffed the new person that they pat the side of
    the dog's neck or side of the shoulder instead. Patting a dog on the top of the head is
    interpreted by dogs as a powerful dominance attempt and can be a challenge to some dogs, a
    frightening thing to others.</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Arial">Start taking your dog new places - nearby parks, dog-allowed
    beaches - and, especially to obedience classes! The opportunity will allow you to
    determine how your dog responds to strange people, dogs and places.</font></small></p>
      <b><p><small><font face="Arial">LOVE AND ENJOY YOUR NEW DOG!!</font></small></p>
      <p><small><small><font face="Arial">Authority without domination.<br>
    Love without subservience.<br>
    Respect without fear.</font></small></small></p>
      </b><p><small><font face="Arial">This is an adage used by workers in GSD rescue. It is
    appropriate for rescued Chessies, too, and we'd like people to think about it as they live
    with and train their rescue dogs. You do not need to frighten you dog into complying with
    household obedience commands, or prove to him that you are the toughest creature around by
    using constant brute force. You DO need to show your dog that you are the leader in the
    household, a leader he should put his trust in following. You can do this by
    &quot;telling&quot; your dog this in a language he understands - body language and daily
    habits. Respect is not something that you can force a creature into giving you. </font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Arial">Above all, be patient, firm and consistent with your new
    Chessie. Use positive reinforcement and lots of praise when she's good. When mistakes are
    made, correct her when it's happening, and praise her when she modifies her behavior.
    Undoubtedly you will get lots of advice - good and bad - from other dog owners! Read and
    research as much as you can to prepare yourself. Understand that sometimes you may need to
    try more than one approach to a problem because every Chessie is different. Most rescue
    and adoption coordinators will follow-up on the dogs they place. Most rescuers are backed
    up by dog behavior and health experts within their own local organization, so if they
    don't know the answer to a problem, they can ask others. Don't be afraid to ask questions,
    bring up new situations, and feelings of frustration that you may have! Our goal is to
    make sure rescue dogs never have to be uprooted again, so we are quite interested in
    helping you troubleshoot any problems - the sooner the better before they become big
    problems that threaten the placement!</font></small></p>
      <p><small><font face="Arial">Most of all, be prepared to give and receive more love,
    affection and loyalty than you ever thought possible! Enjoy your brown dog for many years
    to come and thanks again for helping us rescue Chessies!</font></small></p>
