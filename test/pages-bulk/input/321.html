<p>The dracunculiasis (Guinea worm) eradication campaign has specific implications for
efforts to control other emerging infectious diseases. Guinea worm, a painful disfiguring
disease, affects primarily adults, who often become ill in very large numbers (usually 30%
or more of a village's population) during the planting or harvest season. The disease used
to be transmitted in parts of Asia and in Africa in open standing stagnant water. The
intermediate host of the parasite, the copepod, contains the larva of the worm in such
open drinking water; these organisms are barely visible in a glass of drinking water held
up to the light. Thirteen years ago, the disease was still endemic in parts of the Indian
subcontinent, a small part of Pakistan and India, Yemen, and the band of countries across
Africa from east to west. </p>

<h3><b>The Guinea Worm Eradication Campaign</b> </h3>

<p>Several interventions have been used to end transmission of Guinea worm disease: health
education (teaching people to filter their water through a finely woven cloth and not to
enter water when they or their neighbors are infectious), safe drinking water from such
sources as underground borehole wells, and vector control (using Abate). </p>

<p>The Guinea worm campaign, like other campaigns in the past, has illustrated the
importance of political mobilization, including the mobilization of national leaders. For
example, General Amadou Toumani Touré (a charismatic former head of state of the Republic
of Mali), with the encouragement of President Carter in 1992, made the eradication of
Guinea worm disease in Mali and in the nine other French-speaking countries in West Africa
his personal mission. </p>

<p>The campaign faces a problem common to many other efforts to control infectious
diseases in the industrialized and the developing world: underreporting. For example, in
Ghana, as in Nigeria 10 years ago, and in many other countries, only three or four
thousand cases of Guinea worm disease were officially reported; but the actual numbers
were much higher. In 1989 when Ghana conducted a nationwide village-by-village search,
almost 180,000 cases were found. Sudan began its eradication program late because of civil
war. In 1996 and 1997, an apparent decline of cases in Sudan was due to less complete
reporting because of increased fighting in 1997. </p>

<h3><b>The Campaign's Implications for Other Diseases</b> </h3>

<p>The Guinea worm campaign has demonstrated very graphically the possibility of
village-based monthly reporting in Africa. In Ghana and Nigeria at the beginning of this
program 10 years ago, such reporting did not exist. Now in those countries, more than
6,000 disease-endemic villages have volunteers who report to the national capital monthly.
</p>

<p>The Guinea worm campaign has also demonstrated very clearly the efficacy of health
education. In the beginning, many were skeptical because Guinea worm could not be combated
with a vaccine, and eradication efforts had to rely on behavior change. However, behavior
has changed. While we have been successful in helping to bring safe drinking water to many
disease-endemic villages, the fastest and most effective intervention has been health
education, which helped people understand where the parasite was coming from, how they
were being infected, and the importance of using cloth filters to protect themselves and
their families. </p>

<p>The campaign has underscored the potential of local volunteers. Many years ago in the
Americas, village volunteers were used as part of malaria control efforts. The
onchocerciasis control program in Africa is also using village volunteers successfully.
The Guinea worm campaign has been another illustration of how volunteers can be used to
diagnose, report, and provide, in this instance, on-the-spot treatment to neighbors for a
specific infection. Those responsible for the campaign's success are often not members of
the general health services. </p>

<p>With the help of the World Bank, the Guinea worm campaign demonstrates the importance
of disease eradication to the national economy. The World Bank has estimated that the
economic rate of return on the investment in Guinea worm eradication will be on the order
of 29% per year once the disease is eradicated. That figure is based on a very
conservative estimate of the average amount of time infected workers are unable to perform
agricultural tasks. </p>

<p>The campaign has also created a group of trained health-care workers of a different
generation from those involved in the smallpox eradication program. These workers have
gone from beginning to end, from hearing the doubters and seeing the difficulty of
initiating the campaign to tasting victory in their own countries. These workers can
contribute to subsequent campaigns. Moreover, the concept of eradication, which was in
disrepute only 5, 10 years ago, has been revived. Soon we will confirm that a nonviral
disease for which vaccine is not available can be eradicated. </p>

<p>Like the smallpox eradication campaign, the Guinea worm campaign has illustrated very
vividly in many different ways and at many different levels (from international to village
level) the power of data. In the Guinea worm campaign, we have used surveillance data to
promote health policy. One key lesson from the smallpox campaign we are deliberately
applying in the Guinea worm campaign is to distill what needs to be done in terms of
interventions to a handful, or almost a handful, of indexes (seven on an international
level) to know what is most important and (as rapidly as possible) how well we are doing.
That unleashes inordinate amounts of energy. </p>

<p>Finally, the Guinea worm eradication campaign will have illustrated again the power of
demonstration. Eradication can happen because it has happened. </p>
