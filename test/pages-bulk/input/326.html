  <H4><li>The care of all the different species of trees is essentially the same.</li></H4>
  <H4><li>As soon as you arrive home place the tree in a bucket of water. Should the sap on
the butt of
the tree have become "crusty", cut a thin slice (about 1/2" thick) off the butt and place it in
water immediately. This is not necessary if you are using the new intravenous watering
system.</li></H4>
  <H4><li>Leave the netting on the tree until you install the stand and bring it indoors. The
netting
makes it much easier to get the tree through doors and halls.</li></H4>
  <H4><li>Locate the tree well away from sources of heat, such as fireplaces, heater vents,
space heaters
and stoves.</li></H4>
  <H4><li>An anti-transpirant is helpful in keeping your tree fresh. If the trees were not treated
in the
field, you may want to treat it yourself.</li></H4>
  <H4><li>Keep in mind that all trees can consume large amounts of water. But the Leylands
and
Sapphires are unbelievable. You should expect them to consume 2-3 gallons per day. Water
consumption decreases as time progresses. The extent to which you care for your tree will
determine it freshness during the Christmas season.</li></H4>
  <H4><li>Christmas tree safety is very important and its your responsibility. There has never
been a
case where a Christmas tree auto-ignited. Most fires originate from faulty wiring in the
lights.
Before you string the lights on the tree, test each string. If they are not working properly and
can not be readily repaired, discard them and purchase new ones. The risk of a fire is not
worth the cost of a string of lights. Always unplug the lights at bed time or when you are
going to be out of the house.</li></H4>

<h1>New Technology for Christmas Trees</h1>
<h3>Standtastic Adjustable Stand- </h3>
<i>(Harold Odom, inventor)</i><p>

<h4>This new tree stand can actually save marriages by making the setup of the annual
Christmas tree
so simple and easy that the customary family bickering and fighting is all but eliminated. The
two primary functions of a Christmas tree stand are; first, to hold the tree and; second, to
provide
a means of adjustment so that it can be plumbed vertically. The Standtastic stand has separate
and independent features to accomplish these two primary functions. The handle of the tree is
secured in the trough of the support bracket using two quick release bands (hose clamps).
The
bands are tightened using a screwdriver. Stand the tree up by tipping it over on the two long
legs.
Use your foot to extend the remaining short leg. With the tree standing, adjust the thumb
screws
to obtain the required vertical orientation. In the case of large heavy trees, it may be
necessary to
lift the weight off the leg being adjusted to make the thumb screw easier to turn. Keep in
mind
that, a small change in the leg angle will make large change in the tree position. So, the
thumb
screws should be adjusted in 1/4 turn or 1/2 turn increments.</h4>
<p>

<h4>Once the entire family is satisfied with the tree position, a separate water bowl can be
placed
under the butt of the tree, or the I-V can be installed. Because the water bowl is left behind
when
the tree is being taken down, the possibility of spilling the water is greatly reduced.</h4>

<h3>Christmas Tree I-V-</h3>
 <i>internal watering system</i><p>

<h4>This system replaces the conventional "butt in bowl" watering apparatus. It consists of
a syphon
tube, two expanding rubber sleeves, a pinch valve and a used gallon milk jug as a water
reservoir. Two 1/2" diameter holes are drilled in to the woody tissue of the tree trunk. The
syphon is started by covering the vent hole in the jug stopper and squeezing the jug. Once
the
syphon has been established, the flow is stopped using the pinch valve. The expanding rubber
sleeves are place into the drilled holes in the trunk. The pinch valve is opened and the flow
of
water to the tree begins. Capillary act carries the water up the trunk and out the branches to
the
tree foliage, keeping it fresh and pliable.</h4>
<p>

<h4>This watering system has a number of significant advantages. The water reservoir is
readily
visible. It is not covered by the tree skirt and Christmas packages. So, there is no question as
to
when it needs refilling. The reservoir is easily refilled. Simply close the pinch valve, remove
the
syphon tube and stopper, bring the jug to the faucet, fill it, return it to the tree, replace the
stopper and tube, and open the pinch valve. Since the entire system is closed, the water
never
becomes contaminated or stagnant. When it's time for the tree to come down, simply remove
the
jug, the syphon tube and expanding sleeves. The tree is now ready to be moved with no risk
of
spilling an attached water bowl. Allow the tubes to drain and dry; and store the system til
next
year.</h4>
<p>

<h4>While the tree is up, a drip pan should be placed on the floor under the butt of the
tree so that any
dripping sap, or water, will not stain the carpet.</h4>
