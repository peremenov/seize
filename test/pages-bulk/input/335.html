    <P><FONT SIZE=+2>E</FONT><B>arly Manhattan settlers obtained water for domestic</B> 
     purposes from shallow privately-owned wells. In 1677 the first public well 
     was dug in front of the old fort at Bowling Green. In 1776, when the population 
     reached approximately 22,000, a reservoir was constructed on the east side 
     of Broadway between Pearl and White Streets. Water pumped from wells sunk 
     near the Collect Pond, east of the reservoir, and from the pond itself, was 
     distributed through hollow logs laid in the principal streets. In 1800 the 
     Manhattan Company (now The Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A.) sank a well at Reade 
     and Centre Streets, pumped water into reservoir on Chambers Street and distributed 
     it through wooden mains to a portion of the community. In 1830 a tank for 
     fire protection was constructed by the City at 13th Street and Broadway as 
     was filled from a well. The water was distributed through 12-inch cast iron 
     pipes. As the population of the City increased, the well water became polluted 
     and supply was insufficient. The supply was supplemented by cisterns and 
     water drawn from a few springs in upper Manhattan.</P>
    <P>After exploring alternatives for increasing supply, the City decided to 
     impound water from the Croton River, in what is now Westchester County, and 
     to build an aqueduct to carry water from the Old Croton Reservoir to the 
     City. This aqueduct, known today as the Old Croton Aqueduct, had a capacity 
     of about 90 million gallons per day (mgd) and was placed in service in 1842. 
     The distribution reservoirs were located in Manhattan at 42nd Street (discontinued 
     in 1890) and in Central Park south of 86th Street (discontinued in 1925). 
     New reservoirs were constructed to increase supply: Boyds Corner in 1873 
     and Middle Branch in 1878. In 1883 a commission was formed to build a second 
     aqueduct from the Croton watershed as well as additional storage reservoirs. 
     This aqueduct, known as the New Croton Aqueduct, was under construction from 
     1885 to 1893 and was placed in service in 1890, while still under construction. 
     The present Water System was consolidated from the various water systems 
     in communities now consisting of the Boroughs of Manhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn, 
     Queens and Staten Island.</P>
    <P>Since 1842, there have been no significant interruptions of service other 
     than brief annual shutdowns for the purpose of routine inspections during 
     the period from 1842 to the Civil War.</P>
    <P>In 1905 the Board of Water Supply was created by the State Legislature. 
     After careful study, the City decided to develop the Catskill region as an 
     additional water source. The Board of Water Supply proceeded to plan and 
     construct facilities to impound the waters of the Esopus Creek, one of the 
     four watersheds in the Catskills, and to deliver the water throughout the 
     City. This project, to develop what is known as the Catskill System, included 
     the Ashokan Reservoir and Catskill Aqueduct and was completed in 1915. It 
     was subsequently turned over to the City's Department of Water Supply, Gas 
     and Electricity for operation and maintenance. The remaining development 
     of the Catskill System, involving the construction of the Schoharie Reservoir 
     and Shandaken Tunnel, was completed in 1928.</P>
    <P>In 1927 the Board of Water Supply submitted a plan to the Board of Estimate 
     and Apportionment for the development of the upper portion of the Rondout 
     watershed and tributaries of the Delaware River within the State of New York. 
     This project was approved in 1928. Work was subsequently delayed by an action 
     brought by the State of New Jersey in the Supreme Court of the United States 
     to enjoin the City and State of New York from using the waters of any Delaware 
     River tributary. In May 1931 the Supreme Court of the United States upheld 
     the right of the City to augment its water supply from the headwaters of 
     the Delaware River. Construction of the Delaware System was begun in March 
     1937. The Delaware System was placed in service in stages: The Delaware Aqueduct 
     was completed in 1944, Rondout Reservoir in 1950, Neversink Reservoir in 
     1954, Pepacton Reservoir in 1955 and Cannonsville Reservoir in 1964.</P>
    <P>Water for the system is impounded in three upstate reservoir systems which 
     include 19 reservoirs and three controlled lakes with a total storage capacity 
     of approximately 580 billion gallons. The three water collection systems 
     were designed and built with various interconnections to increase flexibility 
     by permitting exchange of water from one to another. This feature mitigates 
     localized droughts and takes advantage of excess water in any of the three 
     watersheds.</P>
    <P>In comparison to other public water systems, the Water System is both economical 
     and flexible. Approximately 95% of the total water supply is delivered to 
     the consumer by gravity. Only about 5% of the water is regularly pumped to 
     maintain the desired pressure. As a result, operating costs are relatively 
     insensitive to fluctuations in the cost of power. When drought conditions 
     exist, additional pumping is required.</P>
