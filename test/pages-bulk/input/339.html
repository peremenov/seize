<p align="left">Actually, the title is a little misleading; because you can't always win,
but if you have good reasons for your appeal this information should help you present your
case.</p>

<p align="left">The Board of Equalization was created by the Legislature to give citizens
an opportunity to contest the Assessor's valuation of their property.&nbsp; However, the
Legislature realized that counties get most of their revenue from property taxes, and if
it was easy to get the valuation reduced counties would soon run out of money.&nbsp; The
Legislature handled this by saying in effect &quot;Ok, you have the right to appeal your
valuation but we're going to make it an uphill battle for you to win.&quot;</p>

<p align="left">The Legislature accomplished this by saying, &quot;The Assessor's
valuation is assume to be correct.&nbsp; In order for the taxpayer to win his appeal he
must show by <strong>Clear, Cogent, and Convincing Reasoning</strong> that the Assessor
has made a mistake.&quot;&nbsp; Clear, cogent, and convincing evidence means a quantum of
proof which is less than beyond a reasonable doubt, but more than a mere preponderance of
the evidence.&nbsp; It is the quantum of evidence necessary to convince the trier of fact
that the ultimate fact in issue is &quot;highly probably.&quot;&nbsp; Most Boards of
Equalization take this to mean that the taxpayer's evidence must make it pretty obvious
that the Assessor made a mistake.&nbsp; The key word in the last sentence is the word
&quot;evidence&quot;.&nbsp; You must give good evidence to support your appeal.</p>

<p align="left">Let me give you an example.&nbsp; You and your next door neighbor get a
letter from the Assessor informing you that the value of each house has risen to $75,000.
&nbsp; Both houses are identical and both of you fill an appeal before the Board of
Equalization.&nbsp; Your neighbor comes before the Board and says, &quot;This assessment
is ridiculous; my house can't possibly be worth more than $55,000.&nbsp; I only paid
$35,000 for it seven years ago.&nbsp; I plan to live the rest of my life in this house.
&nbsp; I'm not going to sell it to make a fast buck!&quot;</p>

<p align="left">When it is your turn to go before the Board, you say, &quot;This
assessment is ridiculous; my house can't be worth more than $55,000.&quot;&nbsp; Then you
show the Board that three other houses in the area have been sold in the last year. &nbsp;
The house that was identical to yours sold for $54,000, another house that is similar to
yours sold for $56,000.&nbsp; The last house, which was better than yours, sold for
$66,000.&nbsp; You show the Board that no houses in the area have sold for more than
$66,000.&nbsp; Now this is a pretty simple example by 99 times out of 100 the Board of
Equalization will rule in the following manner:&nbsp; you win your appeal, but your
neighbor's appeal is denied.&nbsp; The reasoning behind these two rulings is this: &nbsp;
your neighbor did not present any evidence that supported his contention that the Assessor
made a mistake, on the other hand you gave some good hard evidence that supported your
appeal.</p>

<p align="left">Let me explain about the sort of evidence that Boards of Equalization like
and don't like to see.&nbsp; If you tell us that your roof leaks and that there is water
damage in the house, bring us some pictures that show the damage.&nbsp; Bring an estimate
from a contractor showing how must it will cost to fix the roof.&nbsp; If your foundation
is cracked and the floor is buckled, bring some estimates of the cost to repair
everything.&nbsp; Bring us pictures that backup your contentions.&nbsp; If the Assessor
says your house is worth $50,000 and you have tried for the last year to sell the house
for $45,000 and had no offers, bring a letter from your Realtor confirming it.&nbsp; Show
us that a house similar to yours, sold for a good deal less than the assessed value of
your house.&nbsp; The Board of Equalization is delighted to see good hard evidence.</p>

<p align="left">The Board is not impressed with appeals based on emotion.&nbsp; Don't jump
up and down about the percent of tax increase.&nbsp; It doesn't matter what the percentage
of increase is as long as the marketplace will support the value.&nbsp; Don't tell us that
your grandfather bought the property for $100 fifty years ago and that you have no
intentions of ever selling out just to make a buck.&nbsp; The Board could care less about
your intentions; the only thing we care about is the present market value.</p>

<p align="left">The best place to get sales information is the Assessor's office. &nbsp;
All recorded sales in the county are available there.&nbsp; It will take time and energy
but the information is available to you.&nbsp; The easiest way to get another appraisal is
to hire a fee appraiser.&nbsp; The fee appraiser can do all the work for you. &nbsp; The
downside to hiring a fee appraiser is the cost.&nbsp; In addition, the fee appraiser's
report may or may not support your appeal.</p>

<p align="left">There are three methods for determining the market value of a piece of
property:&nbsp; the Direct Sales Comparison method, the Cost Approach to Value, and the
Income Approach to Value.&nbsp; While each method has its strengths and weaknesses, the
direct sales comparison method generally carries the most weight.&nbsp; Almost anyone can
use the direct sales comparison method; all the information you need can be found in the
Assessor's office.&nbsp; If you are going to use the cost approach or the income approach
it might be wise to take to your accountant and an attorney.</p>

<p align="left">Bring us an argument based only on emotion and outrage and you won't have
a chance; bring us some good hard persuasive evidence and the Board may be able to grant
your appeal.</p>
