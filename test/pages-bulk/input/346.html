            <br />
            <p>At one point, reviews said,
			telecom giants AT&T, MCI and Sprint were the best choices for long distance
			service but this is no longer true, partly because call quality and service
			are uniformly good across all vendors. Meanwhile, the cheaper no-name companies
			buy their long distance service wholesale from the telecom giants, so the
			quality of service is generally the same no matter what. Fueling the competitive
			market are cell phone companies, most of which lure consumers away from traditional
			long-distance services with free evening and weekend minutes. </p>
	<p>Conventional long-distance
			providers are staying competitive with cell rates, offering single-rate 24/7
			plans, so calls to out-of-state relatives no longer need to be delayed in
			order to snag lower nighttime or weekend rates. In our research, we found
			long-distance rates as low as 2.5¢ per minute. And surprisingly, we discovered
			the big three are offering competitive rates in bundled packages. A bundled
			package is a flat rate fee for unlimited local, in-state and long-distance
			calls. This type of plan, however, is only beneficial if you make a high number
			of calls.</p>
	<h2 class="subtitle">Per-minute plans offer cheap long distance</h2>
	<p>If you make less than 12
			hours of long-distance calls per month, then a per-minute plan is probably
			your best bet. Of course, you'll need to do a little math and figure in your
			local service in order to decide whether you'd do better with an all-inclusive
			long-distance plan like AT&T's Unlimited Plus (*est. $29.95 per month).
			But if you don't make that many long distance calls, a per-minute plan will
			most likely be your cheapest option. Three companies came up repeatedly in
			our research: ECG, Pioneer and CogniState. Newcomer
			3U Telecom has the best international long-distance rates.</p>

<p>SaveOnPhone.com and Tollchaser.com
			say that right now, ECG (Enhanced Communications Group) has the best deal.
			Long-distance rates with ECG Easy 2.5 run 2.5¢ per minute state-to-state with
			a minimum 59¢ monthly charge. The minimum per-call charge is six seconds and
			after that, calls are charged in 18-second increments. While this isn't the
			absolute lowest billing increment we found (some companies bill in six-second
			increments; 3U bills in one-second intervals), competing companies such as
			OPEX and PNG charge by the minute. Customer service appears to be a factor
			in many of the reviews we read, and ECG excels in this respect as well. Editors
			at SaveOnPhone say customer-service response time
			was less than one minute. </p>
	<p>With ECG's Easy
			2.5¢ plan, you must pay your pay automatically with a credit or debit card.
			A paper bill or check payment isn't an option. ECG has another plan, the Basic
			3.5 plan, which charges 3.5¢ per minute with a $2.50 monthly minimum. The
			only advantage to this plan is that you get a monthly bill in the mail, which
			you can review before you pay.  Still, if you prefer receiving a monthly paper
			bill, ECG has one of the better deals. These plan won't be available to customers in about 15% of
			the U.S.,
			depending on your local service carrier. You can determine whether you are
			eligible for ECG by punching in your phone number on their Web site (https://dialecg.com).
			Note that calls to Hawaii and Alaska cost more (18.7¢ per minute for Alaska
			and 21.4¢ for Hawaii). Higher-cost calls to these states are typical of discount
			long-distance services.</p>
	<p>CogniState and CogniWorld are
			both listed in the top five in many of the reviews we read. CogniState, which boasts great in-state rates, also has a
			long distance plan which includes a competitive 3.45¢ per minute rate with
			no monthly minimum and no monthly service charge, along with six-second billing
			increments. Online billing is free, but if you prefer a paper bill, CogniState tacks on a $2 monthly fee if your bill is under
			$20. If your bill is over $20, the paper-bill charge is waived. In our research,
			we found this policy to be fairly typical of discount long-distance companies. </p>
	<p>William Van Hefner, editor
			of The Digest, reviews the CogniState 3.45¢ per
			minute plan and highly recommends it. He also points out the low rates only
			apply to those whose phone service is provided by a regional Bell company
			such as SBC, BellSouth, and most of Verizon. Customers outside of these service
			areas will pay a higher rate. But if your area is served by these companies,
			then you also qualify for the cheaper ECG plan. </p>
	<p>Known for their International
			rates, CogniWorld charges 3.9¢ per minute in the
			48 continental United States, and offers low international rates such as 4.3¢ per
			minute to Moscow and 5.5¢ to Italy. Like CogniState, CogniWorld charges
			by six-second increments and has a minimum six-second call time. There are
			no monthly fees, but there is the same $2 fee if your bill is under $20 and
			you want your bill by mail. Rates for calls to Hawaii (9¢ per minute), and
			to Alaska (12¢ per minute), are better than most, but not as great as 3U's
			4.8¢ per minute cost to either state.</p>
	<p>3U is a new company mentioned
			in two reviews we found, and it undercuts other providers when it comes to
			international calls and calls to Alaska and Hawaii, even though its 4.8¢ per
			minute domestic rate is higher than ECG and CogniState/CogniWorld.
			3U charges in one-second billing increments, an industry first. That means
			that if your call lasts three seconds, you pay for three seconds. With other
			plans, you'd pay for a six-second call or even a 60-second call. There is
			no monthly fee, and no minimum usage charge. Billing is online or by e-mail,
			and you must pay with an automatic credit or debit card deduction. You'll
			have about three days to review your bill before your card is charged. You
			may choose to receive a paper bill, but 3U charges $1 for paper.</p>
	<p>One of 3U's most unique
			features is its cheap international calling rates. Many countries (including
			Australia, Japan, Germany and the U.K.) cost the same 4.8¢ per minute as domestic
			calls (when calling a landline). 3U also gives you a special access number
			so you can get those same rates when calling from your cell phone (as long
			as your cell phone is registered in the 48 continental states). Your cell
			company will simply think you are making a domestic call. If you're calling
			an international cell phone, rates vary a lot, but are still lower than other
			companies. Complete rate info is easy to find on the 3U Web site (http://www.3Utelecom.com).
			3U is available to anyone; your local carrier does not have to be a Baby Bell
			(as it does with ECG), so 3U is a good choice for those who can't get ECG.</p>
	<p>Total Call International
			is not mentioned very often among the least expensive calling-plans, but this
			company has the advantage a wider availability than ECG or CogniState.
			Total Call has a 3.9¢ per minute, 24/7 rate plan with no minimums or monthly
			fees, and six-second billing increments. You get a regular paper bill in the
			mail. Total Call's customer service is unique in that you can request a Spanish-speaking
			representative, in addition to five other languages. Although it is more expensive
			than ECG, Total Call is available with most carriers, and is a good choice
			if you don't live in ECG's coverage area and don't
			make many international calls (3U is cheaper for international calls).</p>
	<p>Pioneer is another company
			we saw mentioned frequently in reviews of long-distance services. Pioneer's
			per-minute rate is cheaper than anyone else: 2.7¢ per minute for domestic
			calls (excluding Hawaii and Alaska). This company also has a good reputation
			for customer service. Billing, however, is in 60-second increments, so if
			you make a 10-second call, you are billed for 60 seconds. Like ECG, your current
			location must be served by a baby Bell company, so about 15% of the country
			won't be able to access Pioneer. Paper bills cost $1. There appears to be
			little difference between ECG and Pioneer, but we like ECG's shorter
			billing increments. If you make a lot of intrastate calls, it pays to check
			the rates of both carriers.</p>
	<p>We also saw several plans
			that offer some kind of incentive for luring your friends and relatives to
			join up. AmeriCom offers an incentive of 3.5¢ per
			minute for referring three friends plus a bonus of 1% of your friends' usage,
			but if you are always nagging your friends to switch phone providers, you
			might find yourself with fewer friends to call. Several providers offer incentive
			minutes. PNG (Power Net Global) entices new customers with 100 free minutes.
			The catch is that these minutes are distributed after four months, and you
			can only use 25 free minutes per month. If you fail to use up your free minutes,
			you lose them. </p>
	<p>Big Red Wire is also available
			in all but fifteen states (excluded states are AK, AZ, CO, IA, ID, ND, MN,
			OR, MT, NE, NM, SD, UT, WA and WY). There's no monthly charge, and rates are
			2.6¢ per minute. Big Red Wire offers only e-mail customer service and automatic
			credit/debit card billing. If you know anyone else using BRW, this company
			will give you $5 worth of free calls per month, but only to other users of
			Big Red Wire. </p>
	<h2 class="subtitle">Free Long Distance</h2>
	<p>Keep in mind that you can
			also make free Internet calls through software applications you can download
			for free. The catch is that you can only call people who also have the same
			installed application. One popular service is Skype (http://www.skype.com),
			which gets great reviews. You can call anyone else who has installed the software
			over your Internet connection at no charge. Skype also has add-on plans that
			let you call regular phones through your computer for about 2¢ per minute
			in the U.S., Canada, most of Europe and Australia.</p>
	<p>We have a separate report
			on <a href="http://www.consumersearch.com/www/internet/voip/index.html">VoIP</a>
, which includes software such as Skype that lets you make free long-distance calls through
			your computer.</p>
	<h2 class="subtitle">Important Features: Long-distance phone service</h2>
	<p>Here's what the experts
			say to look for when choosing a long distance carrier: </p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Check the fine print for a monthly fee or minimum usage charge.</b> For most
				callers, a monthly fee is a completely unnecessary expense. Since long distance
				rates decrease as competition grows, some companies add a monthly fee to offset
				these lower charges. Most companies call this charge a 'recovery fee.' The
				only federally mandated charge is federal tax. The USF (Universal Service
				Fund) charge is required of long-distance companies, but the company is under
				no obligation to pass the fee to consumers (most do anyway). Anything additional
				charges on your bill (other than calls) are assessed by the long-distance
				company, no matter what phrasing they use.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
   	<li><b>Time increments can have a big impact on your bill.</b> Some companies (like
						AT&T) bill
						in one-minute increments; if your call lasts one minute and one
						second, you're charged for two minutes. This unused time can add up, especially
						if you make many short long distance calls. Programs that bill
						at six-second increments more accurately reflect your actual calling time.
						Editors of Phonedog.com say the savings are 12% to 14% when using a six-second
					billing increment versus a full minute plan. </li>
  	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Inbound toll-free service is a nice option. </b>This can be a great way to
							avoid accepting charges for collect calls. Many long distance
					providers now offer residential 1-800 numbers, usually with the same rates
					as outbound long distance calling. There's usually a monthly charge of about
			$3 for this service and many services, such as ECG and 3U, offer it for free. </li>
	</ul>
	<p>The USF (Universal Service
			Fund) is a required fee from the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) used
			to help supplement phone service for low-income families, schools, roads,
			libraries and health care. Phone-service providers are under no obligation
			to pass the fee to consumers, but most do anyway. In the past, companies used
			this as a license to charge pretty much whatever fees they liked, attributing
			them to USF and pocketing the difference. That has changed. The FCC now mandates
			that all companies charge the same fixed amount, which is announced and changed
			quarterly, and pay the full amount to the FCC. The current USF fee can be
			found on the FCC Web site (www.fcc.gov). </p>
	<p>Bear in mind that this report
			has no relevance to intrastate calls. If a considerable amount of the charges
			on your monthly bill comes from long distance calls made within your state
			(i.e., from Los Angeles to San Francisco), you'll have to do some of your
			own research to find the best rates, since intrastate rates vary so greatly
			from state to state and between carriers it's impossible to make recommendations
			for the general consumer. SaveOnPhone.com is a good resource for checking
			the intrastate rates of various long distance providers.</p>

   <p><p>ECG, with eight recommendations,
			is included in our Fast Answers as the best domestic cent/minute provider.
			Total Call is also listed in our Fast Answers, even though it's more
		expensive than ECG, they serve most of the U.S. CogniState, CogniWorld,
			and Unitel aren't far behind ECG with their low
			rates and no monthly fees. But most of these companies cost more than ECG's 2.5¢ plan,
			and are not included in Fast Answers. Pioneer comes close,
			with a 2.7¢ plan, but Pioneer charges in 60-second increments. 3U is a new
			company with some terrific international, Hawaii and Alaska rates.</p></p>

         <div class="fssection">
            <h2 class="subtitle">10-10 Long Distance</h2>
	<p>Before the emergence of
			so many low-cost direct-dial plans, 10-10 long distance providers were the
			cheapest way to make a long distance phone call. These require you to first
			call an access number before placing your call.10-10-834's 3-cents/minute
			rate is low, but every call has a 39¢ connection fee. So, even
			if you get an answering machine, your call costs 39¢.</p>
	<p>10-15-335 has a 3.9¢ per-minute
			rate for the first ten minutes, and then the rate increases to 4.9¢ per minute.
			The catch is that there is a ten-minute minimum per call. 10-10 long distance
			plans are not the great deal they once were.</p>
	<h2 class="subtitle">Unlimited long distance  Flat-rate long distance</h2>
	<p>If you make more than fifteen
			hours or so of long-distance calls, a flat rate plan may be worth investigating.
			AT&Ts Unlimited Plus plan includes "all you can talk" local
			calls, plus in state and state-to-state long distance for $29.95. AT&T
			charges a monthly connection fee in 23 states to recoup charges from some
			local phone companies. The fee varies, but is generally between $1.25 and
			$1.75. You can find out if your state is included by consulting the AT&T
			Web site. AT&T's Unlimited Plus plan does not include local service, and
			you need to have AT&T local service to qualify for the plan. AT&T's
			all-inclusive local and long distance plans start at $58.</p>
	<p>SaveOnPhone.com recommends
			an MCI plan - The Neighborhood bundle plan - for users who spend over $60
			on local and long distance service. Prices for unlimited calling start at
			$49.99 (and as low as $39.99 in California).
			The Neighborhood supplies customers with caller ID, call
			waiting, speed dial, voicemail, three-way calling and DSL options. </p>
	<p>In comparison, a bundled
			package from Cognigen, $29.99 ZeroCents,
			for first time customers, has no setup fee, disconnection fee or regulatory
			assessment fee. Therefore, you'll save a couple dollars over AT&T, but
			only if you're a first time user. </p>
	<p>VoIP plans include both
			local and long distance calls, along with lots of extras like voicemail and
			call waiting. Starting at about $25 per month, most VoIP services are cheaper
			than traditional bundled local/long distance plans. See our report on <a href="http://www.consumersearch.com/www/internet/voip/index.html">VoIP</a>
 for more.</p>
