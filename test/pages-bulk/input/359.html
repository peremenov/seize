  influential &quot;friends&quot; may threaten the Church far more than
  its obvious enemies. One such dubious ally, the nice-sounding <a href="http://www.freedomforum.org">Freedom
  Forum</a>, has won the support of many Christian leaders by joining their quest for
  &quot;religious freedom&quot; in public schools. Few seem to realize that the cost of this
  questionable partnership is the purity of God's Word. Remember, the Bible's message ceases
  to be God's uncompromising Truth when slashed by inter-faith criticism, judged by group consensus, and
  molded to fit politically correct standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

	<font size="2" face="Arial">Yet,
  Christians across the country praise this revival. With their approval, a compromised
  view of the Bible blends with other sacred writings and religious messages in the classroom. By a
  strange consensus, these religions are being
  adapted to fit a new
  interpretation of the First Amendment -- one that twists its promised freedom into pretext and
  control. Thus, schoolchildren learn &quot;about the Bible&quot; through a pre-planned group
  process which twists God's truths into the evolving ideals of the planned global spirituality.

	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">For more than half a century, UNESCO has pursued the goal of its first

    The roots of exclusion and hatred have
    shown themselves even deeper and more tenacious than we had feared...

    	<font size="2" face="Arial">(emphasis and link added)</font></p>
  </blockquote>
 	<font size="2" face="Arial">To
  achieve solidarity, UNESCO must win public consent for mind-changing psycho-social strategies that
  would mold and monitor the way people think everywhere. To win this consent, it needs a public crisis --
  one that's either real, exaggerated or merely an illusion. Reality matters far less than
  public perception.&nbsp; </span>
	</font>
	<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The crisis summarized in the
  UNESCO mission fits the
  need. With help from the media, it has already persuaded people around the world that &quot;the resurgence of nationalism, the growth of
  fundamentalisms and of religious... intolerance&quot; is a &quot;global threat.&quot;&nbsp;This
  perception can now be used to conform, not only nations and &quot;fundamental&quot;
  Christians to the UN vision, but also the Bible itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p></p>
 	<font size="2" face="Arial">Christians
  who love God's Word know that </span>His family is made up of people from &quot;every
  tribe and nation.&quot; In Christ, people from every race and culture become one. Yet, Biblical Christianity is considered too narrow and divisive for the globalist leaders who have been
  planning the new solidarity since 1945. Notice the blatant intolerance toward Biblical
  truth and other &quot;certainties&quot; in this 1946 statement by Dr. Brock Chisholm,
  first head of the World Health Organization:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;We have swallowed all manner of poisonous
    certainties fed us by our parents.... The results are frustration, inferiority,
    neurosis and inability to... make the world fit to live in....</font></p>
	<p><font face="Arial"><font size="2">&quot;It has long been generally accepted that
    parents have a perfect right to impose any points of view, any lies or fears,
    superstitions, prejudices, hates, or faith on their defenseless children.... [People with] guilts, fears, inferiorities, are certain to project their hates
    on to others.... Such reaction now becomes a dangerous threat to the whole
    world....&quot;</font><a href="twistingtruth.html#6"><font size="1">[6]</font></a></font></p>
  </blockquote><font size="2" face="Arial">God's
  absolute, unchanging truth simply doesn't fit the new ideology. His absolute truth offends those who pursue contrary
  beliefs and lifestyles. It seems &quot;intolerant&quot; and &quot;hateful&quot; to
  those who seek public approval for their own ways. </span>Charles Haynes
  summarizes this view well: </font>
 
  	</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="text-indent: 0"><font size="2" face="Arial">“Bitter
    culture wars over abortion, homosexuality and other social issues are acerbating (sic)
    our

  it? That's not what I learned when I became an American citizen. These
  &quot;democratic first principles&quot; are part of Mr. Haynes' definition of the First
  Amendment. They represent a new way of looking at the Bill of Rights -- one that ties
  the right to express one's faith to a responsibility 
  to participate in a manipulative group dialogue. (See <a href="../text/articles/turfur12-98.html">Trading U.S. Rights for UN Rules</a>)
  This form of dialogue teaches each person to replace individual
  thinking with collective thinking under the noble banner of &quot;common good.&quot;&nbsp; But his definitions include
  other details.</font></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Finding Common Ground</i>  outlines the social contract for the
  global village. It also illustrates
  how its group of authors did &quot;redefine the words&quot; and introduce a new social
  contract. Quoting from the Williamsburg Charter, which laid the foundation for The First Liberty
  Institute headed by Dr. Haynes, it states,</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;The Compact Must be Mutual.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    ...that rights are universal and
    responsibilities mutual is both the premise and the promise of democratic
    pluralism….. From this axiom… derives guidelines for conducting public debates
    involving religion….&quot;</font></p>
   
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;First, those who claim the
    right to dissent should assume the responsibility to debate:
    Commitment to democratic pluralism assumes the coexistence with one political
    community of groups whose ultimate faith commitments may be incompatible, yet whose
    common commitment to social unity and diversity does justice to both the requirements
    of individual conscience and the wider community. A general consent to the obligations
    of citizenship is therefore inherent….&quot;&nbsp; </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Second, those who claim the
    right to criticize should assume the responsibility to comprehend….
    Genuine tolerance honestly weights honest differences and promotes both impartiality
    and pluralism. Debased tolerance results in indifference to the differences that
    vitalize a pluralistic democracy….&quot;

	that bridge the inter-faith and cross-cultural divisions. Naturally, it doesn't take long
    before the group's

	change the context. &quot;Rights&quot; include the politically correct &quot;right&quot; not to 
	be offended by contrary truth or arguments. &quot;Respect&quot; includes the &quot;right&quot; 
	to be appreciated and affirmed, no matter how irrational or unbiblical one's 
	beliefs. Responsibility, among other things, refers to the obligation to 
	follow the new social guidelines. Group members are held accountable, not to 
	personal convictions, but to ambiguous and open-ended &quot;rules&quot; such as these:</font></p>
	<blockquote>

	</blockquote>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0"><font size="2" face="Arial">Hidden in these 
	phrases is the understanding that absolute facts and uncompromising faith in
  God's Word are <i>not appropriate</i> in the consensus process. Words that imply that your beliefs
  might be more true than other beliefs could offend the group. Therefore, participants
  may freely share their
  thoughts and feelings, but not their uncompromising convictions.&nbsp;</font></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0"><font size="2" face="Arial">In this

	<font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;What

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0"><font size="2" face="Arial">Why is the
  imagination so important to the new way of thinking? Because, unlike fact and faith, the
  imagination can be manipulated through all kinds of stories, myths, and images. By
  putting &quot;teaching about the Bible&quot; into a context teeming with timeless myths
  and inter-faith idealism, God's Word becomes little more than just another myth, a
  collection of stories -- one that may seem far less noble than other, less honest,
  &quot;sacred&quot; books.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0"><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Finding Common Ground</i> echoes this aim: “If agreements and policies are to inspire broad support in the community, all
