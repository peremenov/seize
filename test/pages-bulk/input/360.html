        <p><i>I'm putting this last chapter of Crooked Cucumber on cuke.com
        because Ryuho Yamada plays a role in it and I'm putting stuff on the
        site about Ryuho. His parts herein are<span
        style="background-color: #FFFF00"> encased in yellow</span>. What I
        don't say in the book is that after Suzuki, with his wife present, had
        announced that he had cancer to his disciples, who were there in the
        city and who'd come from outside not knowing why, and to Ryuho, Ryuho
        was said to be the only one who cried. And he cried hard, sitting on the
        floor. He was devastated and he emoted without reservation though he'd
        only known Suzuki for two weeks at the time. - DC</i></p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Silas had given some lectures that summer at Suzuki's behest. In early
      September Suzuki asked Silas to come see him. As they talked, seated in
      the tatami room of Suzuki's apartment, Suzuki fingered his mala, a
      Buddhist rosary. It had large sandalwood beads, each carved into the shape
      of a skull. Silas looked at the skulls and at Suzuki, and he felt deeply
      apprehensive.</p>
      <p>Suzuki was very ill. His skin was yellow; the doctor said he had
      hepatitis. Okusan was taking care of him with assistance from Yvonne, who
      also kept him abreast of Zen Center matters. They were very careful to
      avoid infection and didn't share any food with him, as had been their
      habit. Aside from attending an occasional zazen, the last time he'd done
      anything in public was the lay ordination for fifty-five students at the
      end of August. He hadn't even been able to attend his own ordination of
      four new priests in September. Katagiri, now called Katagiri-roshi at
      Suzuki's request, performed it for him by proxy, having come up from
      Tassajara where he was leading the practice period. Ed Brown was first in
      line, then me, then Lew Richmond, who'd been studying with Suzuki since
      1967, and Angie Runyon.</p>
      <p>Suzuki's absence was conspicuous. It was a somber occasion. Afterward
      we all went to his apartment to greet him and stood at his bedside. He
      acted like it was the happiest day of his life. After leaving his room I
      went up on the roof of the building, walked amidst the potted plants,
      looked out over San Francisco, and cried.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">A young monk named Ryuho Yamada
      arrived from Japan in late September. Over tea, Okusan learned that he
      knew the healing arts of <i>shiatsu</i> (pressure-point massage) and
      acupuncture. She asked him to give her a treatment, and he passed the
      test. He was supposed to have gone straight down to Tassajara, but now he
      was needed in the city. Every afternoon he worked on Suzuki for a couple
      of hours.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Ryuho was a thick-spectacled,
      enthusiastic, naive young monk, and he immediately started gobbling up the
      strange experience of Zen in America. He knew quite a bit of English and
      spent a lot of time talking with students.</span></p>
      <p><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">&quot;Ryuho-san, if you
      continue to live in America, and you want to be a success in America, you
      have to be majime. If you are not majime you will not be
      appreciated.&quot; Suzuki was sitting up in bed, talking in Japanese to
      the new monk. Okusan had told him the same thing. &quot;Just be majime and
      you'll have nothing to worry about.&quot;</span></p>
      <p><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Majime is usually translated as
      &quot;serious,&quot; but it includes the qualities of sincerity and
      enthusiasm. In Japan, Ryuho knew he could easily get by as a priest with
      canned majime; there were centuries of tradition and the cloud of
      vagueness to hide in. But in America the students were straightforward,
      and everything was clear. He loved the communal aspects of Zen Center: the
      natural food, women and men living together on an equal basis. Even
      Suzuki's wife was willful and would tangle with him. The students saw in
      Ryuho, as in other Japanese monks, qualities that they admired. A perfect
      place for Japanese monks, he thought. They can learn from us, and we can
      learn from them.</span></p>
      <p><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Ryuho discovered Suzuki could
      be short-tempered. Once Ryuho commented on a Buddha statue, casually
      saying it was just a piece of wood. Suzuki barked at him not to speak so
      flippantly: until he knew the true meaning of the statue he should shut
      up. Then as quickly as the anger came, it was gone. Ah, thought Ryuho,
      he's innocent and honest, like a child.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&quot;So, you've come to see our yellow roshi,&quot; Yvonne said, and
      that's how Albert Stunkard learned Suzuki was ill.</p>
      <p>&quot;Yellow?&quot; he asked.</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes, he has hepatitis.&quot;</p>
      <p>Dr. Albert Stunkard was chairman of the department of psychiatry at the
      University of Pennsylvania. In September 1971 he had come out to work at
      Stanford Hospital for a year, largely because he wanted to be near Suzuki,
      whom he had studied with in the</p>
      <p>past. Stunkard, one of the senior Zen practitioners in the States, had
      started his study when he was a doctor to Japanese prisoners being tried
      for war crimes in Tokyo in 1946. One of them had told him about D. T.
      Suzuki. He met the great scholar and subsequently became his student and
      occasional doctor. Stunkard had studied with Nakagawa, Yasutani, and other
      teachers as well. He met Shunryu Suzuki for the first time at Sokoji in
      1967, and Suzuki embarrassed him by asking him to deliver the lecture for
      that evening.</p>
      <p>Entering Suzuki's bedroom, Stunkard saw that Suzuki was scratching. A
      chill went down Stunkard's spine. He knew there were two types of jaundice—one
      infectious (hepatitis), the other obstructive. An obstruction to the
      outflow of bile causes itching. The obstruction couldn’t be gallstones
      because Suzuki's gall bladder had been removed. Stunkard felt terrible but
      didn't say anything at the time. He just asked if he could confer with
      Suzuki's doctor.</p>

      <p>On October 10, 1971, Shunryu Suzuki called his Bay Area disciples
      together. They were asked to wear their robes. At ten o'clock they entered
      the apartment and gathered around his bed, joining his team of caregivers—<span
      style="background-color: #FFFF00">Ryuho sitting on the floor</span>,
      Okusan by the door, looking tired, and Yvonne at the bedside fussing with
      Suzuki over an office cassette recorder. Mel had driven in from Berkeley
      and Bill from Mill Valley. Also present were Silas, Reb, Lew, and Angie,
      all of whom lived in the building. Claude came from his home in San
      Francisco. Everyone was quiet. There was a feeling of tense anticipation.</p>
      <p>Suzuki sat up in bed, propped up by pillows. He was frail and thin, and
      his skin had become a darker yellow, but his spirits were good. He smiled
      warmly, glad to be with so many of his closest students. He hadn't seen
      them much in the past six weeks. They re-</p>
      <p>turned his smiles and stood in a semicircle around his bed. On Page
      Street cars passed, and birds chirped in the rubber tree outside the
      window.</p>
      <p>Suzuki cleared his throat and turned on the tape recorder. Then he
      softly told them what they feared to hear.</p>
      <i>
      <p>As you know, my doctor thought I had hepatitis, but my symptoms didn't
      change for such a long time, so he thought it might not be hepatitis,
      maybe cancer. So I went into Mt. Zion Hospital again three days ago and
      they checked me out—and the doctors discussed my illness. The day before
      yesterday my doctor came and told me, &quot;You have cancer.&quot; And he
      explained exactly what is happening. So now I am telling you.</p>
      </i>
      <p>Suzuki immediately set about putting people at ease and giving a
      positive spin to the news. He spoke as if it were no big deal, adding that
      it was a great relief to find out that he had cancer and not hepatitis,
      because now he could eat and drink whatever he wanted, and they could
      share food with him without worrying about contagion.</p>
      <i>
      <p>I myself selfishly feel good, but on the other hand, I am very sorry
      for you. But I think buddha will take care of everything, so I won't worry
      too much. How long I'll live I don't know. No one knows actually. I asked
      the doctor, &quot;Two years?&quot; &quot;At most,&quot; he said. I am not
      so sure about it. So I want you to be prepared. If I live longer, it is
      better, of course, for me and for you. I think I can live one more year
      for sure, I feel that way. I don't feel so discouraged or weak. So maybe I
      want you to allow me to be a lazy monk, that's all. I shall be a very bad
      example, but [laughing] instead, you should be a good example. Okay?
      That's all that I want you to do—to prepare. Most things you can decide
      among yourselves. If necessary, I can join your discussions. Physically, I
      get tired quite easily. Thank you very much.</p>
      </i>
      <p>Abruptly he turned to Claude, the oldest, whose counsel he had valued
      since they first met in 1963. &quot;Claude, I want you to stay here, even
      though I am no more. Okay? Please.&quot; Claude, cornered, affirmed that
      he would. &quot;Thank you,&quot; Suzuki said, going on to make</p>
      <p>a point about their roles as priests and about the priest's
      responsibility within the larger Buddhist community. &quot;You shouldn't
      feel you have to do exactly what I did, you know. You are free to develop
      our way as people want you to do. That is the bodhisattva idea.&quot;</p>
      <p>He leaned close to the mike when he said this. He was speaking to
      Richard Baker, for whom the tape was being made. Suzuki's tone of voice
      said, you should come back now and assume this responsibility. Richard and
      Suzuki had been corresponding with Yvonne's assistance throughout his stay
      in Japan. Since the spring there had been discussion of Richard's
      returning in the fall or winter to assume some of Suzuki's
      responsibilities. Richard had been resistant to the idea—he didn't feel
      ready for that. Now Suzuki was twisting his arm.</p>
      <p>After some joking with his disciples, Suzuki had the tape rewound and
      played. At the exchange with Claude he listened carefully, stopped the
      machine, and acted pleased that Claude was on tape saying he would stay,
      although his answer was fairly inaudible. Suzuki bowed to his crestfallen
      disciples and they bowed back, going out with tears in their eyes to share
      the tragic news with the community.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The day before, when Yvonne had gone to the hospital to pick up Suzuki,
      she'd found him sitting on the edge of his bed with legs dangling below
      his hospital gown. Okusan was in the hall saying goodbye to some visitors.
      The nurse had just brought his lunch, and he patted the bed and motioned
      to Yvonne to come over. She knew something was up. He slowly mouthed the
      words, &quot;I have cancer,&quot; with a big grin on his face. She was
      confused because the two things didn't go together—cancer and grinning.
      As she sat next to him, he pulled over the food tray. &quot;I have cancer.
      That means we can eat together again.&quot; He took a forkful from his
      plate and fed it to her. Yvonne threw her arms around him and cried.</p>
      <p>&quot;This cancer is my friend, and my practice will be to take care of
      this sickness,&quot; he told her.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Dr. Stunkard, who had first realized Suzuki had cancer, talked to him
      about going to the cutting-edge Stanford cancer unit, but Suzuki decided
      against it, saying, &quot;This doctor is my doctor, and I have to respect
      him. It wouldn't be appropriate to see another doctor.&quot; Stunkard
      tried to tell him things were different in America, but Suzuki stood firm.
      After talking further with his colleagues at Stanford, Stunkard decided
      that Suzuki had made the right decision. The type of cancer he had was not
      responsive to treatment, it had spread, and radiation and chemotherapy
      would just make him sicker.</p>
      <p>&quot;You know we often talked about teaching in the past,&quot; Suzuki
      said to Stunkard. &quot;So many of these young people are afraid of dying.
      I can show them that you don't need to be afraid of dying. It's a
      wonderful teaching opportunity.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I wish you were doing some other kind of teaching,&quot; Stunkard
      said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes, I don't want to die. I don't know what it's going to be like
      when I die. Nobody knows what that's going to be like. But when I die,
      I'll still be a buddha. I may be a buddha in agony, or I may be a buddha
      in bliss, but I'll die knowing that this is how it is.&quot;</p>

      <p><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Ryuho continued to do shiatsu
      on Suzuki every day. He concentrated on points in Suzuki's back that
      corresponded to the liver. He pressed his feet and legs and arms. Suzuki
      was weak but alert. If Ryuho's mind wandered while working, Suzuki would
      immediately tell him to concentrate.</span></p>
      <p><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Ryuho was intrigued by the
      people who came to see Suzuki: disciples, students, friends, scholars,
      artists, teachers, priests, members of the Japanese congregation at
      Sokoji, other Buddhist teach-</span></p>
      <p><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">ers.</span> There was Maezumi,
      the teacher of the L.A. Zen Center, who'd known Suzuki since 1959, and
      Bishop Sumi from Zenshuji in L.A. Eido Shimano, Nakagawa's disciple and
      the teacher at the Zen Studies Society in New York, dropped by to pay his
      respects one day.</p>
      <p>Bob Halpern visited. He had been studying with the Tibetan teacher,
      Trungpa, in Boulder. On Suzuki's bedside table was a large postcard Bob
      had sent. Instead of a note, he had drawn a picture of Trungpa's altar,
      which had a Buddha in the center, Trungpa's Tibetan guru on the left, and
      Suzuki-roshi on the right. Trungpa came a few days later. Suzuki spoke to
      him optimistically about the future of Buddhism in America. Trungpa sat by
      Suzuki's bed, holding his hand for over an hour.</p>
      <p>Almost every day some old-timer would enter Suzuki's room and stay for
      half an hour—Betty, Della, Jean, Mike Dixon, and others. Suzuki had
      asked Philip to come as much as possible, and he would drive in every few
      days from Santa Rosa. Okusan told Philip that Suzuki said to let him in
      any time he came. Philip said he'd break down the door if he couldn't get
      in.</p>
      <p>Grahame sent a letter from Tokyo expressing concern and saying that
      he'd come as soon as he could, in late December, when he would be visiting
      Pauline and the children in Mill Valley. He was fully involved with the
      English language school he had started and could not get away until then.</p>
      <p><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Ryuho stood by and listened as
      Alan Watts and Jano paid their respects. He couldn't understand what they
      were saying, but it was a lively meeting, considering Suzuki's condition.
      Watts was in fine form. Jano teased her husband, and Ryuho worried that
      Suzuki would die on the spot, he was laughing so hard.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Louise brought her newborn daughter to visit wearing a tiny rakusu, the
      last that Suzuki had inscribed. The little one's name was Johanna. Suzuki
      was sitting on a low table in the tatami room. In front of him was his
      well-worn pocket-sized dictionary, brought from Japan and often carried
      back and forth between Tassajara and the city. He picked it up and said,
      &quot;This will live longer than I will.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Suzuki expressed great regret over his cancer. &quot;Before my
      disciples are ready to come out of the oven, I will be going into
      it.&quot; Louise was surprised at his sadness, because she still had the
      idea that a Zen teacher wouldn't have that kind of feeling.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Suzuki told Bill Kwong the opposite, saying: &quot;I've put my cookies
      in the oven, they've come out fine, and now I'm going to crawl in.&quot;
      He'd say different things at different times, but clearly he was thinking
      about his disciples and what to do for them before he died.</p>
      <p>Richard Baker was coming back. There was going to be a ceremony to make
      him the new abbot. Page Street and Tassajara were abuzz with talk about
      it. How could this be? He'd received transmission, but still, how could he
      take on Suzuki's role? What about Katagiri? What about the other priests?
      What about Bill Kwong, who'd been with Suzuki almost from the first and
      who had a zendo in Mill Valley? What about Silas, who was giving lectures,
      Jean in Carmel Valley, Mel in Berkeley, and other disciples?</p>
      <p>Suzuki told Claude that he wanted to give transmission to a number of
      his disciples before he died. Especially, he emphasized, he must complete
      Bill Kwong's transmission ceremony. But there were others. He was thinking
      of giving transmission to six to twelve disciples. He wanted to ask
      Noiri-roshi to come over from Japan to work with these students for
      several months in preparation for the ceremony. Claude asked what would be
      the difference between Richard's transmission and these, and Suzuki said,
      &quot;They will be the same as Richard's—no difference.&quot;</p>
      <p>Claude conferred with a few people, and they all agreed that Suzuki was
      too ill to do this. Okusan was also opposed to her husband's plan. Noiri
      needed a special diet, and she'd have to take care of them both, which
      would be too much for her. Suzuki made it clear how much he wanted to do
      it, but Okusan told him to leave it to Richard, who was coming back and
      could carry out Suzuki's wishes. She and Claude agreed; and after they
      told Suzuki how they felt, he gave up and didn't mention it again—not
      even to Richard.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Suzuki asked Okusan to go back to Japan after he'd passed his authority
      to Richard in the Mountain Seat Ceremony. He said he wanted to do
      saitokudo, reordination. She knew that he wanted to spend the remaining
      time with his students and to let them take care of him, to be as close to
      them as possible. He'd read a book Katagiri had given him by Kodo Sawaki,
      with an introduction by Katagiri's second teacher, Eko Hashimoto. It
      stressed that priests should practice celibacy and not live with women. It
      didn't seem very practical to Okusan.</p>
      <p>She said, &quot;I'd comply with your wish if you were getting well, but
      I couldn't possibly leave you in this condition. Who would cook rice gruel
      and other Japanese food for you? You need someone who can understand your
      needs by a single wink.&quot;</p>
      <p>She wrote to Hoitsu immediately, and he wrote right back, urging her to
      stay with her husband by all means, or they'd just have to send someone
      else from the family to take care of him. Hoitsu sent a similar letter to
      his father. So Suzuki gave up on that idea too. One by one he had to let
      go of his wishes.</p>
      <p>When he had enough energy to walk down the stairs to the basement,
      Suzuki still went to zazen occasionally. Afterward he couldn't get back
      up. He wanted to make it on his own but couldn't. Sometimes Reb and Peter
      would make a chair out of their arms, and he'd sit and enjoy the ride. He
      made it fun. He was very sweet about such dependence. His life was not in
      his own hands anymore.</p>

      <p>Richard Baker returned with Virginia and Sally. As soon as they
      arrived, he went to see Suzuki. Soon Suzuki-roshi</p>
      <p>would pass to him the enormous responsibility of taking care of Zen
      Center and all the people who came there. He would be the chief priest.
      &quot;I'm so sorry for what I'm about to do to you,&quot; Suzuki said to
      him, tears filling his eyes.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&quot;How could someone with your intuition choose to marry someone as
      difficult as me?&quot; Okusan asked.</p>
      <p>&quot;Because you are ridiculously honest,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>&quot;What should I do when you die?&quot; she asked him.</p>
      <p>&quot;Stay here,&quot; he said. &quot;Don't go back at all.&quot; He
      said everyone would be happy if she stayed, that her ten years in America
      would make it hard for her to adjust to Rinso-in. But how could she be
      helpful at Zen Center? she wanted to know.</p>
      <p>&quot;You are fair in your dealings with people. It will work out
      naturally.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Should I become a nun?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, that would be best.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;I'm too old for that. Maybe I'll be a monk in my next life.&quot;</p>
      <p>That got him laughing, which started him coughing. Okusan helped him
      over onto all fours so she could pound his back. He stopped coughing.
      &quot;You're lucky you have someone to take care of you to the last
      moment,&quot; she said in a teasing voice.</p>
      <p>Suzuki raised a hand in a faint gassho. Then he farted loudly.
      &quot;That's for you,&quot; he said.</p>

      <p>Knowing that their father could pass away at any time, Suzuki's
      daughter Yasuko and son Hoitsu arrived for the first time in the States
      with godfather Amano, to say their farewells. They were shocked to see him
      so jaundiced and weak. They stood at his bed saying a few polite phrases,
      not knowing what to do. But Su-</p>
      <p>zuki was more open and easygoing than in the old days, and before long
      they were talking comfortably with him and among themselves. Okusan was
      making noodles in the cramped kitchen. Then Philip, a familiar face, came
      to visit.</p>
      <p>At Page Street, and later at Tassajara, his children witnessed with
      amazement what Suzuki had accomplished in his twelve years in the States.
      It was hard for Yasuko and Hoitsu to imagine that their father was a
      dharma teacher with many disciples, and that a book of his lectures was
      selling well. They were impressed that everyone called him Roshi and
      amazed to hear from Americans such enthusiastic praise for his lectures.
      &quot;Mother always said his problem was that he didn't know how to
      lecture about Buddhism, that he didn't express himself well enough,&quot;
      Hoitsu said. Their father had hardly ever said anything to them about
      Buddhism, so they didn't even think of him as someone with a particularly
      good understanding of it. But the evidence of his effort lay before their
      eyes.</p>
      <p>Yasuko, Hoitsu, and godfather Amano arrived at Tassajara in time to
      attend Bill Kwong's head monk ceremony, at which Katagiri officiated. One
      after another the American students put their hands in gassho and asked
      the head monk questions about dharma and life. Hoitsu couldn't believe
      what he was seeing and got teary—they were doing the ceremony sincerely,
      spontaneously, and in good form.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>I came up from Tassajara to pay a visit to my dying teacher. Richard
      answered the door. I'd already spent time with Richard at Tassajara, so we
      just greeted each other briefly. &quot;Right now is a good time to see
      Roshi,&quot; he told me. Knowing me well, Richard was quite firm about the
      time limit. &quot;Don't spend any longer than five minutes unless
      Suzuki-roshi absolutely insists that you stay longer.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Okay, I promise,&quot; I told him.</p>
      <p>After I'd put on my robes I went to his room. Okusan led me into the
      bedroom and directed me to a chair next to his bed. Suzuki looked up and
      smiled. We bowed. He looked terrible. With some difficulty he pulled
      himself up and sat on the edge of the bed, close</p>
      <p>to me. Then he slapped his thighs like he'd do to indicate pleasure. I
      just sat there moping. &quot;I feel fine,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't
      feel so serious.&quot; That was all I needed. &quot;Okay,&quot; I said
      snapping out of it.</p>
      <p>He asked me what I was doing at Tassajara, and I said I was the
      assistant director. He acted impressed. Then he gave me a little advice.
      He said that, as a priest, I should have two specialties, one primary and
      one secondary. My first one, he said, should be to take care of guests,
      something I'd done since Tassajara opened. And the second one could
      possibly be scholarship. His point wasn't to tell me what to do. He
      trusted that my seniors at Zen Center and I would work out the details on
      our own. It didn't matter to him so much what I did, I think, but he knew
      I needed some wholesome activity to be engaged in through the years that
      would both express my true nature and keep me out of trouble.</p>
      <p>I was touched by his concern. Here he was wasting away, and all his
      attention was on another, giving me a boost, conspiring with me to the end
      to have faith in myself.</p>
      <p>We talked a while longer and then I said I had to go. &quot;No, no,
      stay,&quot; he said. I remembered what Richard had said, and I also
      thought Suzuki should lie down and rest, so I stood up and bowed. Then he
      said, &quot;If you leave I will be unhappy. If you stay I will be
      happy.&quot; &quot;Okay,&quot; I said. He asked me if I'd met his family
      and I said yes, that I'd shown them around Tassajara. So he called them
      all in and we talked and visited for half an hour. It was lots of fun, and
      I completely forgot that Suzuki was dying and this was the last time we
      would meet. I don't even remember saying goodbye to him.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&quot;With these hands I have done many things in my life,&quot; Suzuki
      told Hoitsu. &quot;I never imagined all the things I would do with these
      hands in America. Now my work is almost finished. It would be good to go
      back to Japan and die there.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Would you like to go back to Japan with me?&quot; Hoitsu asked.</p>
      <p>&quot;I will crawl if necessary,&quot; his father answered.</p>
      <p>Hoitsu was surprised to hear his father say that. Since his third year
      in America it had seemed that he would never return. Seeing</p>
      <p>his two eldest children and Amano must have awakened a nostalgia for
      his homeland. The ceremony was a week off. They could bring Suzuki back
      with them right after that. Hoitsu talked to Okusan, Yasuko, and Amano;
      with help from Okusan, he talked to Suzuki's doctor, who said Suzuki could
      do it. Hoitsu went to tell his father.</p>
      <p>&quot;Master, the doctor said you can come back with us.&quot;</p>
      <p>Suzuki looked up at Hoitsu and laughed. &quot;Isn't it obvious there's
      no way I could leave here? Can't you people even take a joke?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;You were just telling us what we wanted to hear,&quot; Hoitsu
      said.</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes, of course. I will become American soil.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Yasuko saw her father in a new light in America. Putting a positive
      spin on his misfortune, he told her he'd lived longer than he'd expected,
      that his master So-on had died at the age of fifty-five, he was now
      sixty-seven. The twelve extra years were his time in America. (Suzuki's
      chronological accuracy was sometimes off—So-on actually died when he was
      fifty-seven.) He was thin, soft, and open to her. She'd never felt closer
      to him and was sorry she'd seen so little of him since he left Japan. She
      could finally forgive him for the death of her mother and saw his
      accomplishments in America not only as atonement for but as partially
      motivated by her death.</p>
      <p>She thought of the time in the fifth grade when he'd taken her to
      Shizuoka City and, embarrassed to be seen with him, she'd walked on the
      other side of the street. She didn't feel that gap now.</p>
      <p>&quot;The bond between children and parents is never lost,&quot; he
      told her.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Godfather Amano felt he had accomplished the purpose of his trip. He
      had seen Suzuki, his temples, his students. He could see that Suzuki was
      going to die. &quot;I'd better go back now,&quot; he said. He too had
      cancer and trouble with his bowels; and though he wasn't dying or sick
      like his old friend, it was difficult for him to stay. But Suzuki wanted
      him to witness Richard's Mountain Seat Ceremony.</p>
      <p>&quot;Father,&quot; Suzuki said to him, &quot;there is one more
      important job I</p>
      <p>need to do as a monk. Please see it and report it to the membership at
      Rinso-in. Tell them what I have done since I left them and came
      here.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Father, please fulfill Hojo's wishes,&quot; said Okusan.</p>
      <p>Finally Amano agreed to stay.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>It was more difficult every day for Suzuki to talk, but he could do it,
      especially with Okusan, with whom he could communicate with much less
      effort. &quot;I won't interfere with Zen Center at all once I have handed
      it over to Richard. It's entirely up to him whether it will be ruined or
      not,&quot; Suzuki said to his wife. He even told her and Richard that he
      didn't want any more Japanese priests to come to Zen Center as teachers.
      &quot;From now on, they should come as students.&quot;</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>On Sunday, November 21, at ten in the morning, the halls and courtyard
      of Zen Center were filled with people talking softly and waiting. They had
      come for the Mountain Seat Ceremony in which Richard Baker was to be
      installed as the chief priest of Zen Center. The foyer and hallway were
      lined with rows of chairs. The buddha hall, where the ceremony was to take
      place, was too small for the five hundred guests. Chinese, Tibetan, and
      Japanese priests of various sects attended with some of their disciples.
      Many of the key figures in Suzuki's life in America were there: Wako and
      Emi Kato, Reverend Ogui, George Hagiwara, and many from the Japanese
      congregation of Sokoji. Bill McNeil stood in a corner in a leather jacket;
      poets and artists from the old Beat days came in the front door. So many
      people who had become deeply</p>
      <p>connected in the past twelve years, so many stories like fibers running
      among them, so many for whom Suzuki had opened dharma gates or been there
      with a nudge when their lives turned.</p>
      <p>The bell downstairs was being struck every minute, informing the crowd
      that it was time to settle down. People patiently sat or stood where they
      were. They could hear a procession moving from Katagiri's apartment up the
      street, into the building, and to its various altars. The rumble of the
      deep buddha drum echoed in the halls—the high <i>chin-chun!</i> of
      handheld bells a half-tone apart and the <i>kachin! </i>of wooden
      clackers, the music of the moving rite. On the second floor the procession
      stopped outside Suzuki's room, where Richard offered incense and said:
      &quot;Although I don't know how I came, through your heart-teaching I am
      always here.&quot;</p>
      <p>Katagiri-roshi, Kobun-sensei, and a few of Suzuki's senior monks
      accompanied Richard down the stairs to the hushed buddha hall. Richard
      wore a blue and gold robe with bright-colored flying phoenixes, which
      Suzuki had given him for this day. He carried a ceremonial horsehair
      whisk.</p>
      <p>The assembled crowd was utterly hushed when the spine-chilling sound of
      intermittent thuds and jangling bells jolted everyone to attention. Suzuki
      was walking with the staff Alan Watts had given him. Affixed to the top
      was a bronze headpiece with rings. At his sides were Hoitsu and Okusan.
      They helped him down the stairs and past those seated and standing along
      the way, to the double doors of the buddha hall. With each step he struck
      the floor with his staff, as if continuing to plant the dharma in America.
      There he was, his reddish-brown okesa draping over a yellow koromo. All
      eyes were on him. Many people hadn't seen him in his illness, and even to
      those who had, his appearance was crushing. He was so dark, weak, and
      shrunken. Yet as he moved into the buddha hall toward the specially built
      Mountain Seat altar, his enormous effort and dignity shone through.</p>
      <p>Reaching the brocade-covered altar, still supported on both sides, he
      slowly pulled out from the sleeve of his robe a bowing cloth. Gathering
      his strength, he laid it out properly, bowed down to the</p>
      <p>floor, and rose, somehow, drawing strength from the depth of his will,
      calm and powerful, the way frail old Kitano-roshi had risen from his bows
      at Eiheiji, amazing and inspiring the young Suzuki. Hoitsu helped him to a
      cushioned ceremonial chair to the right of the altar. He sat and looked
      with eyes straight ahead yet downcast, as in zazen.</p>
      <p>People were just catching their breath when Richard Baker stepped
      forward. After the <i>Heart Sutra </i>was recited, Richard stood before
      the Mountain Seat altar and said in classical style: &quot;This Mountain
      Seat, climbed many times before, is the everywhere bodhimandala. With the
      help of my Master and everyone here, in the ten directions and the three
      times, I will climb this mind-seal altar. Do not wonder about it at
      all.&quot;</p>
      <p>He offered incense to buddhas, bodhisattvas, and ancestors, to Trudy
      Dixon, Katagiri-roshi, and &quot;to my own subtle and compassionate
      teacher, Suzuki Shunryu-daiosho,&quot; to whom he said, drawing from
      Suzuki's own Mountain Seat Ceremony at Sokoji in 1962:</p>
      <p>This piece of incense</p>
      <p>Which I have had for a long long time</p>
      <p>I offer with no-hand</p>
      <p>To my Master, to my friend, Suzuki Shunryu-daiosho,</p>
      <p>The founder of these temples.</p>
      <p>There is no measure of what you have done.</p>
      <p>Walking with you in Buddha's gentle rain</p>
      <p>Our robes are soaked through,</p>
      <p>But on the lotus leaves</p>
      <p>Not a drop remains.</p>
      <p>Richard sat on a red lacquered chair before the altar. Katagiri spoke
      for Suzuki loud and clear: &quot;Dragons and Elephants! Accept this holder
      of Buddha's First Seat!&quot;</p>
      <p>Then Richard Baker said, in what may be called the first lecture of his
      abbotship, &quot;There is nothing to be said.&quot;</p>
      <p>A <i>mondo</i> followed, ritualized yet impromptu questions, which</p>
      <p>Richard answered quickly and dramatically. Telegrams were read, formal
      congratulations were made, and the ceremony was over.</p>
      <p>Suzuki was helped to face the altar, where he made another slow,
      painful prostration from which he rose almost by himself. Then he started
      down the aisle to leave. Halfway to the opened doorway he stopped in the
      midst of his sangha, disciples, students, former students, admirers, old
      friends, visiting teachers, and guests. There was utter silence. He looked
      to the left, then decisively rolled the staff several times between his
      hands; the rings at the top burst out jangling. He looked to the right and
      rolled his staff again, and again the rings rang out. It was the sound of
      an ultimate effort. It was the sound of his love and his freedom.</p>
      <p>Tears and sobbing began on all sides. Hearts cracked open. Everything
      was suspended in his presence, in an immense shared feeling—a car
      honking on the street, pigeons cooing, the crying in the room, and a deep
      stillness. Time stopped. A moment that started the day he arrived in
      America continued as he was helped out of the room, striking his staff to
      the floor as he went. He left behind him a room full of palms pressed
      together saying thank you, saying goodbye, saying what could not be said.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>After the ceremony, Suzuki met with his disciples. Twenty or so sat on
      the tatami in his sitting room. It was done. He'd passed on Zen Center,
      Page Street, and Tassajara to Zentatsu Richard Baker, who sat next to him
      a head higher in his fancy robes, his eyes down, the weight of what he'd
      received all over him. Suzuki turned to him, nodded, and smiled. The room
      was hushed. In a faint voice Suzuki said thank you to everyone and to
      Richard and then, nodding toward Katagiri, another breathy thank you
      &quot;for all you've done, for which I am so grateful.&quot; All of a
      sudden a howl arose. It was Katagiri who crawled toward Suzuki crying out,
      &quot;Don't die!&quot; Sobbing, he hugged frail Suzuki, who said in a soft
      rasp, &quot;Daijobu. Daijobu&quot; (It's all right).</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Katagiri had said goodbye to Suzuki and was on his way back to
      Tassajara for the last few weeks of the practice period. He left in
      sadness and with some discomfort at his situation. Seven years he'd served
      Suzuki—hard work, low pay, no time off. Katagiri was dependable and had
      a seamless constant practice. He'd come to be seen as a coteacher by many.
      Suzuki and Katagiri had contained their feelings, speaking little through
      the years. Until the meeting with his disciples following Richard's
      Mountain Seat Ceremony, Suzuki had never verbally expressed his gratitude.</p>
      <p>Suzuki was still troubled by Katagiri's intention to leave. He wanted
      him to remain a senior dharma teacher for the whole community. &quot;Maybe
      Katagiri can still help,&quot; he said to Okusan as he went to sleep.</p>
      <p>Katagiri wasn't the only person he had troubled thoughts about.
      Unfinished business pressed at Suzuki. Bill. Silas. He wanted to take care
      of his disciples. Suzuki's style was to let things happen, nudging them,
      patiently waiting, acting skillfully by not acting rashly. He hadn't known
      how quickly his illness would overcome him. Some disciples were disturbed.
      A few had postponed or given up careers to devote themselves to studying
      with this dying man. Would he leave no final instructions?</p>
      <p>So far Suzuki's instructions were not about practical matters but about
      dying with dignity. It was tragic for his students to see the
      deteriorating physical condition of their dear teacher, yet at the same
      time it was marvelous to witness his composure and see how undiminished he
      was at heart.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In his last meeting with Hoitsu before his son returned to Japan,
      Suzuki implored, &quot;Take care of Bill Kwong for me. Make sure Bill gets
      transmission—you can do it for me.&quot;</p>
      <p>Suzuki wanted Hoitsu to be available to help his disciples in whatever
      way he could, but Hoitsu knew his father didn't want him to interfere with
      Richard. &quot;Leave Zen Center to Richard,&quot; he'd said several times.
      Hoitsu also knew that leaders need assistance, and his father knew it too.
      Richard would need help from his elders, like</p>
      <p>Katagiri and Claude, and from his peers, like Bill and Silas. Even if
      he disagreed with them, he should work with and respect them. Suzuki knew
      there was rivalry but hoped it could move toward cooperation. &quot;It is
      done,&quot; he said to his son. &quot;All I can do now is hope.&quot;</p>
      <p>With the trust he had in Richard and in others, and considering his
      patience and acceptance of problems, Suzuki's hope might have included
      more possibilities than were imagined by his students. If some disciples
      couldn't work together, maybe they could work separately. If there were
      sharp differences, maybe time would smooth the edges. Ultimately, if
      people were sincere, it would be okay. He might have looked at his
      students through his dying eyes and thought, as when Tatsugami landed,
      &quot;You have no idea how much you're going to suffer.&quot;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Amano came to his bedside to say goodbye. &quot;I've finished all my
      duties,&quot; Suzuki told him. &quot;Please report the details to the
      members.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Hai,&quot; Amano answered in the affirmative.</p>
      <p>Suzuki gave Amano his mala bracelet with the skull-shaped beads. He
      told Okusan to roll up a scroll for Yasuko and to give Hoitsu the staff
      with the bronze rings he'd carried in the ceremony. The clanger on top of
      the staff was the last item he wanted to return to Rinso-in, of those he
      had borrowed when he'd left in 1959.</p>
      <p>&quot;Well, we're leaving now,&quot; said Amano.</p>
      <p>&quot;Okay. Goodbye, Father. Have a good trip,&quot; Suzuki said
      softly.</p>
      <p>Hoitsu couldn't believe how casually the two said farewell, as if it
      were just another day.</p>
      <p>Sitting on the plane before takeoff, Yasuko was crying. She wanted to
      get off and stay with her father. Hoitsu told her they had to go back now
      to help Amano explain to people what their father had been doing in
      America these twelve years, what he had created and was leaving behind.
      Nobody had really understood why he left. Now Amano, Yasuko, and Hoitsu
      knew and could tell the others, who should feel some pride in this too.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>A hospital bed was put in a second-floor room overlooking the
      courtyard. There Suzuki could have a sense of the rhythm of the building
      and some time in the sunlight. The buddha hall was right below; during
      morning service he'd listen to the sounds of chanting, drums, and bells
      coming through the window and the open door. Okusan would wash his face,
      and he'd have a glass of orange juice—that was his service. He was too
      weak to get out of bed.</p>
      <p><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Ryuho would get lost looking at
      Suzuki's face as he gave him shiatsu treatments. It was spacy and
      changing, he said, and it didn't look Japanese. He could obviously die at
      any time—Okusan and the doctor said so, too. His skin was dark, almost
      the color of the brown okesa robe. But to Ryuho the light of his eyes was
      powerful.</span></p>
      <p>Yvonne was there every day, staying with him while Okusan cooked, did
      laundry, and cleaned. They took turns caring for him and massaging his
      back, legs, arms—wherever he'd indicate. Yvonne would be sitting by his
      bed and a skinny arm would come out from the covers and go into the air.
      She'd rub it for a while; then he'd pull it back under the covers. Later
      the other arm would appear. She and Okusan massaged and moved him enough
      so that he hadn't gotten any bedsores. He never complained and always
      appreciated the attention he received.</p>
      <p>There was a bottle of painkillers on the table. He refused them, as
      after the gallbladder operation. He had tried them once because his doctor
      told him to, but he didn't like the state of mind that resulted, so he
      asked Yvonne to take them away. Still, he told Richard that sometimes he
      felt like he was being tortured.</p>
      <p>One day Suzuki asked Yvonne to come close to him, and when</p>
      <p>she did he apologized for not having ordained her as a priest, saying
      again that he lacked confidence in training women. &quot;I didn't
      recognize your seriousness to practice,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Suzuki asked Yvonne about Silas and was pained to hear that he had
      already left to lead sesshins in Portland and Quadra Island near
      Vancouver. Silas had come to say goodbye, but Suzuki had been sleeping. He
      sat next to him for a while and then left. Silas did not see eye to eye
      with Richard and had argued that the membership should have had a chance
      to approve of Richard as the new abbot. But most people just wanted to do
      what Suzuki wanted. The board members were all students and couldn't
      accept Silas's democratic and legal approach. He hadn't seen much of
      Suzuki since Richard returned. Now Suzuki was thinking about Silas.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Within a week of the ceremony, Suzuki had almost completely stopped
      talking. Then he stopped eating. His body was soft and weak and thin, the
      size of an eight-year-old child. It had always had a childlike quality,
      but with great strength and energy, the power to move large stones. Now it
      was a dark, dying child's body. <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Okusan
      told Ryuho not to bother coming anymore. </span>Either Okusan or Yvonne
      stayed close by. They still massaged him gently, but to Yvonne it seemed
      that mainly they were just breathing together. She felt there was almost
      nothing they needed to do. Just leave him alone, be with him, and respond
      to his few requests. They wiped his face. When he stopped drinking, they
      kept his lips and mouth moist with a washcloth.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Richard came every day. Sometimes he would talk to Suzuki with Okusan's
      help. She said he could hardly hear now. &quot;Where will I meet
      you?&quot; Richard asked, standing in gassho at the foot of the bed.
      Suzuki's hands came out from under the covers in gassho. Then, with index
      finger extended, he drew a circle in the air, bowed into it, and returned
      his hands under the covers. Richard bowed in return.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>On the evening of December 3, Suzuki was moved from the hospital bed
      overlooking the courtyard to his own bed in his apartment.
      &quot;Tomorrow,&quot; he told Okusan in a hoarse whisper, &quot;I must
      talk to Richard about Silas.&quot;</p>
      <p>Okusan went into the tatami room and spread out the futon. For the
      first time she didn't put on her pajamas, but left her clothes on and lay
      down exhausted to sleep.</p>
      <p>Suzuki's son Otohiro had been there for a couple of days and said he
      would stay till the end, which he knew was near. He slept on Okusan's bed,
      up against his father's in the small room. At about two in the morning
      Otohiro shook Okusan awake. &quot;Mother! Mother! Father wants a
      bath.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;No no no.&quot; She went in and told her husband to go back to
      sleep. He repeated that he wanted a bath. The thought of it made Okusan
      anxious. He hadn't been in a tub for a long time.</p>
      <p>&quot;It's okay,&quot; he said.</p>
      <p>Otohiro wasn't going to argue. He knew the old man would be stubborn to
      the end. Okusan went into the bathroom and started to fill the tub.
      Otohiro carried him into the bathroom slowly and placed him in the tub.
      Suzuki started gasping for air, breathing fast. &quot;It's all over,&quot;
      he said between short breaths.</p>
      <p>&quot;Calm down, calm down,&quot; Otohiro spoke soothingly in his ear
      holding him. &quot;Breathe slowly, breathe slowly.&quot; Otohiro breathed
      loudly and slowly, and his father's breath slowed down till they were both
      breathing together at the same slow rate.</p>
      <p>Suzuki asked for the bar of scented soap that Della had given him. He
      never used anything scented, but he took it and slowly made a good lather,
      and they helped him to clean himself thoroughly. Then he took a long,
      relaxed bath.</p>
      <p>Afterward Suzuki lay on the bed and sighed. Slowly and faintly he
      spoke. &quot;Ahhhh, what a good feeling,&quot; he said, with a wisp of
      pleasure on his face. &quot;Don't wake me in the morning.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Maybe you're thirsty,&quot; said Okusan. &quot;Would you like
      some orange juice or ice cream?&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;Orange juice.&quot; He drank some orange juice, closed his eyes,
      and went to sleep.</p>
      <p>Okusan went back to her futon and Otohiro lay down next to his father
      in the bed. Before long it was four and he heard the wake-up bell—a
      handbell run through the halls to get people up for zazen. It was not just
      any day's zazen, but December 4, the first day of a five-day sesshin that
      would culminate on Buddha's Enlightenment Day, the eighth of December.
      Over a hundred people were participating. Otohiro could hear people
      opening and closing doors carefully, running water in the bathroom across
      the hall. Then came the sharp sound of the wooden han being hit,
      indicating that the new abbot, Zentatsu Baker-roshi (as Suzuki said to
      call him), was on his way to offer incense at various altars. The last
      altar was the one in the zendo, where he would open the sesshin and begin
      the first period of zazen.</p>
      <p>The sound of a bell could be heard faintly coming from the distant
      zendo. Otohiro felt his father move slightly. Suzuki's hand reached over
      and clutched his arm.</p>
      <p>&quot;Get Baker,&quot; came a thin whisper.</p>
      <p>Otohiro jumped out of bed and ran into the tatami room. &quot;Mother!
      Something's happening with father! He said to get Baker!&quot;</p>
      <p>Without a word Okusan leapt up and went quickly down to the zendo.</p>
      <p>Richard had just sat down on his cushion and straightened his robes
      when Okusan opened the side door. Lew was sitting in the space nearest
      her. &quot;Get Zentatsu!&quot; she whispered urgently.</p>
      <p>Richard took long strides to the zendo door and then dashed up the
      stairway to Suzuki's room. Okusan and Otohiro left Suzuki alone with
      Richard. He was still conscious, and with the last</p>
      <p>strength of his life he just barely reached his hand out to his beloved
      disciple. Half sitting, half kneeling by the bed, Richard held his hand
      and touched his forehead to Suzuki's. They rested that way for a few
      moments, then Richard felt the man most dear to him slip away, let go of
      his life. Slowly, Shunryu Suzuki-roshi faded away—so gently that Richard
      could not tell when he died; he just knew it had happened.</p>
      <p>Richard let go of Suzuki's hand. He waited a moment and felt for a
      pulse. Then he went outside to Okusan and Otohiro. Richard had his hand on
      his heart. He spoke in Japanese, his voice cracking, as he told them,
      &quot;Suzuki-roshi's life has ended.&quot;</p>
