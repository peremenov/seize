Well, it's been just over a week since MeatFest and I have a mid-week luncheon planned.  Maybe once a year or so I have some friends come over for a nice lungeon consisting mostly of ... well ... meat. It's good meat and this coming Thursday I plan on having several chickens roasting in a mesquite grill oven.<br />
I knew it was coming, and wasn't sure if I was up to the task.  So the first thing I did was buy a few racks of baby back ribs to hone my skills. They did just fine. I didn't get an after shot because they were so good I just stood over the cutting board and ate what I wanted.  Which was mostly all of them.  Oh well, what you gonna do?<br />

<p>So are you using briquettes, or hardwood charcoal?  If the latter, how the hell do you keep the stuff burning long enough to make ribs?  Do you just add more during the cooking?  </p>

<p>You did good, hon.  The ribs were very rich and yummy-licious.  It was like drinking pure, melted butter.</p>

<p>Hey Robert,</p>

<p>  I haven't used briquettes in years.  I'm a grilling snob. That being said, I use mesquite hardwood charcoal with water soaked hickory or raw hickory chunks when I can find it. I use one of those round tall charcoal stoves to lite the fire and I get about 1.5 hours out of one stove full. When the grill fire starts to get low, I preburn a load in the round cylinder stove and add full-on burning mesquite love. That way the cooking area doesn't take a temperature nose dive. Depending upon how hungry I am, I can get it done in 3 or 5 hours. Baby ribs take maybe 2 or so. If you can master making fires, you can master cooking with them. If you can't make a decent fire and control it to YOUR needs, you'll never get a consistent food. So get out there and master that fire !!!!!</p>
