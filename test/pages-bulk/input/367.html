              <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Henry 
                Wadsworth Longfellow was the most popular poet in American history. 
                His work commanded a readership that is almost unimaginable today 
                even for best-selling novels. In terms of their reach and influence, 
                Longfellow's poems resembled studio-era Hollywood films: they 
                were popular works of art enjoyed by huge, diverse audiences that 
                crossed all social classes and age groups. Writing in a period 
                before the electronic media usurped the serious literary artist's 
                role as society's story-teller, Longfellow did as much as any 
                author or politician of his time to shape the way nineteenth-century 
                Americans saw themselves, their nation, and their past. At a crucial 
                time in American history&#150;just as the Revolutionary War receded 
                from living memory and the disastrous Civil War inexorably approached&#150;Longfellow 
                created the national myths for which his new and still unstoried 
                country hungered. His poems gave his contemporaries the words, 
                images, myths, and heroes by which they explained America to one 
                another and themselves. There is no better example of Longfellow's 
                genius at creating meaningful and enduring national myth than 
                "Paul Revere's Ride."</font></p>
              <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">The 
                opening lines of &quot;Paul Revere's Ride&quot; are still so famous 
                that even people who have not read the entire poem often know 
                them by heart. They have become, in fact, so familiar that most 
                readers might easily take them for granted and miss the striking 
                and paradoxical rhetorical figures they contain. The poem's narrator, 
                for example, begins by saying, &quot;Listen, my children, and you shall 
                hear.&quot; He addresses the tale specifically to children, and yet 
                the work is not in any narrow sense a children's poem. &quot;Paul Revere's 
                Ride&quot; was published in <i>The Atlantic Monthly</i>, hardly a juvenile 
                journal, and was eventually collected in Longfellow's masterful 
                book of interwoven narrative poems, <i>Tales of a Wayside Inn 
                </i>(1863), where it is spoken by the Landlord to an audience 
                of adult men. Why then does the poem begin by addressing only 
                one part of its intended audience?</font></p>

                invoking children in the opening line of his patriotic poem, Longfellow 
                implicitly defines his narrative as a story the older generation 
                considers important enough to pass down to posterity. What will 
                follow, therefore, is not merely an interesting story but a legacy&#150;one 
                of the traditional tales that defines both the audience and the 
                speaker's identity. Perhaps for this reason, Longfellow placed 
                &quot;Paul Revere's Ride&quot; as the first story told in <i>Tales of a 
                Wayside Inn</i>. The characters in the book meet and tell their 
                tales at a tavern in Sudbury, Massachusetts, not far from Boston. 
                Revere's historical exploits would have been a proud part of their 
                shared local lore.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Longfellow's 
                inclusion of the date in the third line serves a similar rhetorical 
                function. (Once again the familiarity of the opening lines makes 
                us forget how odd it is to present a complete date&#150;day, month, 
                and year&#150;in a poem. Longfellow never did so elsewhere in 
                his poetry.) The implicit message of the line is clear: Paul Revere's 
                achievements were of such singular importance that we must learn 
                the date by heart and teach it to posterity. Everyone in Longfellow's 
                original audience would have understood the significance of the 
                date. April 18, 1775 was the day before the American Revolution 
                began. The next morning at Lexington and Concord, the American 
                colonists would fire their &quot;shot heard round the world&quot; and initiate 
                their successful armed resistance against the British Empire. 
                The narrator also explains the necessity of passing this piece 
                of heritage on by reminding the listeners that &quot;hardly a man is 
                now alive / who remembers that famous day and year.&quot; The original 
                witnesses are now mostly dead. It has become the audience's responsibility 
                to preserve the memory of Revere's heroic deeds.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Longfellow 
                was an immensely versatile poet who excelled at virtually every 
                form and genre from the epic to the sonnet. No form, however, 
                better displayed his distinctive gifts than the short narrative 
                poem. Nineteenth century readers greatly esteemed the form, which 
                combines the narrative pleasures of fiction with the verbal music 
                of verse. Modern critics, however, have generally downgraded narrative 
                poetry in favor of lyric verse. Longfellow's reputation has been 
                especially hard hit by the change in critical consensus, and once 
                popular poems like &quot;Paul Revere's Ride&quot; have consequently disappeared 
                from academic anthologies. The special qualities of these poems 
                seem antithetical to the lyric traditions of modern poetry, which 
                prize verbal compression, intellectual complexity, elliptical 
                style, and self-referential movement. Longfellow's greatest gifts 
                were best suited to more public poetry&#150;forceful clarity, 
                evocative simplicity, emotional directness, and a genius for memorable 
                (indeed often unforgettable) phrasing.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">William 
                Butler Yeats once commented that Longfellow's popularity came 
                because &quot;he tells his story or idea so that one needs nothing 
                but his verses to understand it.&quot; That observation particularly 
                applies to &quot;Paul Revere's Ride,&quot; which takes a complicated historical 
                incident embedded in the politics of Revolutionary America and 
                retells it with narrative clarity, emotional power, and masterful 
                pacing. From the poem's first publication, historians have complained 
                that Longfellow distorted the actual incident and put far too 
                much emphasis on Revere's individual role. But Longfellow was 
                not interested in scholarly precision; he wanted to create a stirring 
                patriotic myth. In the process he took Paul Revere, a regional 
                folk hero hardly known outside Massachusetts, and turned him into 
                a national icon. To accomplish this feat, Longfellow mythologized 
                both the incident and the man. The new Revere became the symbolic 
                figure who awakens America to fight for freedom. The actual incident, 
                a literal call to arms for the Revolution, required less mythologization. 
                After all, revolutions are already the stuff of myth. Longfellow 
                had only to streamline the historical narrative so that the poem 
                could focus on a central heroic figure. The resulting story&#150;despite 
                the scholarly complaints&#150;is actually not too far from fact. 
                (Longfellow took considerably fewer liberties than Shakespeare 
                did with British history.) The final poem does not merely recount 
                an historical incident; it dramatizes unconquerable Yankee individuality 
                against the old order of European despotism.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Longfellow 
                was a master of narrative pacing. His description of Revere's 
                friend climbing the Old North Church tower displays the poet's 
                ability to make each narrative moment matter. By slowing down 
                the plot at this crucial moment, Longfellow not only builds suspense; 
                he also adds evocative physical details that heightens the moods. 
                (Decades later Hollywood would discover the same procedures.) 
                Reaching the belfry, the friend startles &quot;the pigeons from their 
                perch.&quot; Fluttering around in they make &quot;masses and moving shapes 
                of shade.&quot; The man now pauses to look down at the graves that 
                surrounded an eighteenth century church&#150;an image that perhaps, 
                prefigures the deadly battle to be fought the next day. This lyric 
                moment of reflection provides a false sense of calm before the 
                explosive action that will follow. The man now remembers the task 
                at hand. There is a crucial deed to do.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">The 
                scene now shifts suddenly&#150;with a decisive cinematic cut&#150;to 
                the opposite shore where the solitary Revere waits for the signal. 
                (What other nineteenth-century American poet would have handled 
                this transition so boldly?) The historical Revere was one of many 
                riders, but Longfellow understood the powerful appeal of the single 
                heroic individual who fights oppression and makes a decisive impact 
                &#150;another narrative lesson not lost on Hollywood. Longfellow's 
                Revere is not a revolutionary organizer; he is a man of action. 
                As soon as he sees the first lantern, he springs into the saddle, 
                though he is smart enough to wait for the second light before 
                he rides off.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">The 
                rest of the poem is pure action&#150;mostly one long tableau of 
                Revere's ride from village to town to village. Once again the 
                effect, to a modern reader, is quintissentially cinematic. Longfellow's 
                galloping triple meters create a thrilling sense of speed, and 
                the rhetorical device of stating the time of night when Revere 
                enters each village adds a cumulative feeling of the rider's urgency. 
                Few poets could sustain a single, linear action for nearly forty 
                lines as Longfellow manages so compellingly in the poem's extended 
                climax. The last two stanzas also demonstrate Longfellow's narrative 
                authority. As the poet makes the sudden but clear transition from 
                Revere's arrival in the town of Concord to the following day's 
                conflict, Longfellow masterfully summarizes the Battle of Concord 
                in only eight lines. Once again, however, he rhetorically conscripts 
                the listener to collaborate in completing the story. &quot;You know 
                the rest,&quot; says the narrator, &quot;In the books you have read.&quot; Ingeniously, 
                Longfellow acknowledges the importance of the next day's battle 
                without accepting the artistic necessity to describe it in detail.</font></p>
              <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">The 
                final stanza returns to the image of Revere riding through the 
                night. Now presented outside of the strictly linear chronology 
                that has hitherto characterized the poem, the galloping Revere 
                acquires an overtly symbolic quality. He is no longer the historical 
                figure awakening the Middlesex villages and farms. He has become 
                a timeless emblem of American courage and independence. Significantly, 
                the verb tenses in the final stanza shift from the past (<i>rode</i>) 
                in the opening five lines to the future tense (<i>shall echo</i>, 
                <i>will waken</i>) in the closing lines. The relevance of Longfellow's 
                patriotic symbol would not have been lost on the poet's original 
                audience&#150;the mostly New England Yankee readers of the Boston-based 
                <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>. Although Longfellow ostensibly mythologizes 
                the Revolutionary War, his poem addresses a more immediate crisis&#150;the 
                impending break-up of the Union. Published a few months before 
                the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter initiated America's bloodiest 
                war, &quot;Paul Revere's Ride&quot; was Longfellow's reminder to New Englanders 
                of the courage their ancestors demonstrated in forming the Union. 
                Another &quot;hour of darkness and peril and need,&quot; the poem's closing 
                lines implicitly warn, now draws near. The author's intentions 
                were overtly political&#150;to build public resolve to fight slavery 
                and protect the Union&#150;but he embodied his message in a poem 
                compellingly told in purely narrative terms. Longfellow's &quot;Paul 
                Revere's Ride&quot; was so successful that modern readers no longer 
                remember it as a poem but as a national legend. Underneath the 
                myth, however, a fine poem waits to be rediscovered.</font></p>
