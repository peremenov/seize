<h3><a name="sealing">Pelt Sealing</a></h3>

<p>Beaver, otter, bobcat, fisher and marten must have a plastic seal attached to the pelt or unskinned animal before:</p> 

<ul>
<li>It is sold or ownership is transferred to another person, or</li>

<li>It is mounted or tanned, or</li>

<li>It leaves New York State, or</li>

<li>10 days have passed since the close of the season where the fur was taken.<br>
<br>
The plastic pelt seals can be removed when the pelt is processed for taxidermy, tanning or manufacturing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is how you get your pelts sealed. It is a 2 step process. </p>

<div class="indent">
<p><strong>Step 1&#8212;</strong> Filling out your furbearer possession tag <a href="pelttag.html">Click for printable tag.</a></p>

<ul>
<li>A possession tag must be filled out for each animal you take.</li>

<li>Possession tags must be filled out immediately after you reach your motor vehicle, camp or home, whichever comes first.</li>

<li>Possession tags must stay with the animal or pelt at all times but they do not need to be attached to the pelt.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 2&#8212;</strong> Getting your pelt sealed All Species</p>

<ul>
<li>A completed furbearer possession tag must be submitted to obtain a plastic pelt seal.</li>

<li>You can give your pelts to another person (other than a taxidermist) so he or she can get the pelts sealed or get them skinned. You must give that person your trapping license or a copy of your license and your completed possession tags while he or she has your pelts.</li>
</ul>


<p>Beaver</p>

<ul>
<li>Furbearer possession tags for beaver can be submitted by mail, FAX (518) 402-8925 or in person.</li>

<li>You also may report a beaver using the <a href="../../license/rptharvest.html"> DECALS</a> call-in system. Call 1-866-GAME-RPT.</li>

<li>Once you have submitted your possession tag(s) for beaver you will be sent or given the plastic pelt seal(s) and instructions.</li>

<li>Immediately upon receipt of seal(s), you must attach the seal(s) to the pelt(s).</li>
</ul>


<p>Otter, Bobcat, Fisher and Marten </p>

<ul>
<li>Only authorized Department representatives can attach the plastic pelt seals to otter, bobcat, fisher or marten.</li>

<li>Call the regional <a href="/website/dfwmr/xoa1e.htm">wildlife office</a> to make arrangements to get your otter, bobcat, fisher, or marten sealed.</li>

<li>Prior to having a marten sealed, you must submit the entire carcass.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3><a name="coyote">Coyote Reporting</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>Report your coyote by calling the DECALS call-in system.  Call 1-866-GAMERPT (1-866-426-3778).</li>

<li>You may use the furbearer Possession Tag to write down the information before you call.</li>

</ul>





<h3><a name="selling">Buying and Selling Fur</a></h3>

<ul>
<li>Species requiring a pelt seal cannot be bought or sold or given to another person unless it has the plastic pelt seal on it. All other species may be bought, sold, and transported without restriction.</li>

<li>Furbearers may be bought or sold either skinned or unskinned.</li>

<li>People who buy fur do not need a fur buyer&#39;s license in New York.</li>
</ul>
