Q.<i> </i></a></span></b><i><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;"><a name="one">I
have read statements attributed to some Buddhist teachers suggesting that
various contemporary and historical</a> examples of human suffering are the
result of the Karma of those who endure that suffering. Does this mean that
people who endure great suffering were deeply unskilful in previous lives and
that those who lead otherwise pleasant lives were skilful people, and if so how
is Karma different from the ideas that underpin Caste structures?</span></i><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;">
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;">A</span></b><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;">.
It is believed as the general rule of the law of karma that we are bearing the
fruit of our <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">actions, whether the result of actions that bring fruit instantly, or
actions at any time in the past, or actions in past lives. But always bear in
mind that karmic law is not the simplistic two-dimensional principle that we
often think it is. Karmic law is more often than not the expression</span> of
multi-dimensional forces that mysteriously interpenetrate and is way beyond the
mind's ability to comprehend.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;">Caste systems are man
made, whilst the law of karma is an innate law of nature.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;"><a name="two">Q. </a></span></b><i><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;"><a name="two">I
attempt to sincerely practice the Dharma but have never been able to accept the
idea of re-birth either in principle or</a> as a matter of faith. I accept that
the nature of reality is not limited by my capacity to comprehend, but I cannot
make sense of the idea that we are reborn or experience re-becoming. Do you
think this is likely to undermine my efforts to practice and my spiritual
progress? Should I just ‘sit with it and see'?<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></i></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;">A. </span></b><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;">I
don't think you have to make a problem out of it and feel that you are not <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">practising
properly. Practice </span>is about dealing with where your feet are at this very
moment, and therefore you could say that is all that is necessary. From my own
experience of getting to know myself over the years of practice, it became <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">obvious
that, with all goes that to make me up, with my strong habits and powerful
attachments, it would be quite absurd to imagine that they just materialised out
of nothing at birth. </span>You could argue these days that genetics may be an
answer, but there is a lot in me that <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">cannot
be applied</span> to that simple idea. <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">And
besides,</span> what creates the genetic map in the first place?<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;">In my own personal
practice the idea of being born over and over again in the lottery of rebirth
and suffering has always been a prime motivation to practice <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">because of the consequences of my actions taught by Buddhism if I chose to
ignore them.</span> To believe that life is a one off seems to me to negate the
whole motivation <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">for</span> Dharma
cultivation. Yes, we could be motivated to do good for others and humanise our
own conduct, but if it all comes to nothing in the end why should we put the
extra effort into changing ourselves that Dharma practice demands?<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;">Definitely 'sit with it ',
and if you are still enough you may well get to see the principle of becoming
being created and acted out inside your own mind and body,<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>and the continuous accumulation of karma which demands
becoming sooner or later. In the time that you have to wait for this
understanding to show, take the leap and make room within yourself for the
indispensable act of faith. Faith in the Buddha, the teachings, and all the
great sages that have arisen throughout the ages, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">who
have</span> continually reaffirmed this law.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Allow this</span> to support you
in your practice.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;"><a name="three">Q.</a></span></b><i><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;"><a name="three">
How important is meditation in the spiritual life? The ground of my practice is
to be found in ethics, and, given the</a> emphasis on meditation, this sometimes
has the effect of making me feel like a second-class Buddhist.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></i></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;">A. </span></b><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;">People
who have this idea that practice is all about sitting merely <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">display</span>
their lack of understanding of the complete process that needs to be put in
place for the changes that practice brings about. Yes, you can say that of all
the parts that go <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">toward</span> make a
complete practice, sitting meditation would be the most important part, but
sitting will not reach its full potential without the support of the rest of the
eightfold path. <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">So it is wrong to think</span>
that if you can't sit you can't practice. There are many people dedicated to
Dharma practice who have difficulty with sitting meditation.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">So
rather</span><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;"> than get
disheartened learn to focus on the rest of the path. Ethical practice is the
obvious one to focus on, for it is the gateway into the Dharma. <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Come</span>
to realise that while you are refining this aspect of the path you are
cultivating the mind in the same way as sitting practice.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;">Restraining and containing
actions, whether they are your thoughts, words or deeds, is possible only by
self-awareness. Putting new thoughts, words and deeds into action is only
possible with that <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">same self-awareness.</span>
To do this you need application born of concentration and the understanding that
your unskilfulness needs to change. Is this not working with the eightfold path
of sila, samadhi, and prajna? What meditation practice will bring to this is a
deepening of what you are already doing, but fundamentally there is no
difference.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;">If you wish to come to
meditation sometime in the future, then adding a devotional practice to an
ethical one will help bring you more speedily to that <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">roundedness.</span> Devotional practice helps to soften the heart and
introduces us to the side of ourselves that we need to learn to get in contact
with in order for the deeper Dharma to arise. Devotional practice usually starts
by projecting outwards to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, but you should soon realise
your relationship with this form of external practice is very much conditioned
by the inner relationship you have with yourself, and therefore should make you
reflect more and more internally.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;">Change that takes place in
practice does not come from the head but rather from a part of us that we are
for the most part cut off from, that deep emotional seat buried within our body.
It is <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">this</span> that we need to become
familiar with, and make friends with all that is contained there. There is
little ‘logic’ here. <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">It takes faith
and trust, becoming familiar with the reality of Dharma practice – which is
the willingness to surrender our profound attachment to the self that imprisons
us in our head and creates the restlessness that prevents quiet meditation being
possible. </span>Devotional practice allows us to start that process of becoming
whole. By combining this with your developing ethical stability and skilful
means born of self-awareness, you will be transforming the emotional and mental
restlessness that prevents you from sitting now. <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">You will be laying the</span> foundation for a fruitful sitting practice
in the near future.<o:p>

Would you agree with the view that buying meat and fish are the same as eating</span></i><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;">
<i>something that has been killed for</i></span></a><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;"><i>
you – meat and fish are made available for consumers. If you buy it and eat it
then all that you have done is avoided the messy business of killing by paying
an anonymous person to do the work for you. So, doesn't buying meat and fish
amount in practice to the killing?</i><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;">A</span></b><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;">.
The Buddha wasn't a vegetarian, nor were his vast sangha, including countless
arhants who, like the Buddha, had finished their training and gone beyond the
creation of karma, reaching the pureness of thought, word and action. The
numerous traditions that sprang up <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in
the East </span>over more than two thousand years since the Buddha have never
been vegetarian, and I don't recall any of the prominent saints and sages of
Buddhism saying that <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">to follow the
Dharma you must be vegetarian. </span>To suggest, as many do, in the West that
the first precept is violated by eating meat is to suggest that all those who
have <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">practised traditional Buddhism, including the Buddha and the arhants, have
been in violation of the first precept. I can best suggest you read the recent </span>post
concerning vegetarianism for my general view on<b> </b>the subject.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;">If you wish to create a
'moral' view for vegetarianism (or anything else), then it should be based first
on the cultural background, and always be a personal view for you alone. Do
remember, there will be <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">many sincere
spiritual people,</span><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"> </b>and many
fine human beings that don't have a spiritual path, who will disagree with
whatever new ideas you come up with. That's why if you really seek guidance as
to what is right and wrong it is best to stay with ‘rules’ that are part of
the natural laws that govern nature, which are always conditioned by the laws of
karma.&nbsp; <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:&quot;Arial Narrow&quot;">If we decide to set up new
ideas and propagate them in the name of <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Buddhist
morality,</span> we will be setting up a duality, which will always create
problems. <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">This will</span> inevitably
bring conflict with those who disagree, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">thus
violating</span> the basic spirit of Buddhism, which is to accept things the way
they are. Remember, never has there been a conflict in the name of Buddhism in
2500 years; do you think that fine record is <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">in place through</span> mere luck?<o:p>
