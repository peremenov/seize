A police architect will also be consulted over security measures.<br>																The secure unit will serve four health boards: Argyll and Clyde, Ayrshire and Arran, Dumfries and Galloway and Lanarkshire.<br>																The sites shortlisted are Kirklands Hospital, Bothwell; Dykebar Hospital, Paisley and The Medical Rehabilitation Unit, Uddingston, and the preferred site will be announced at the end of the year.<br>																NHS Argyll and Clyde say that they are unable to build and sustain a secure unit specifically for this area because only a very small number of patients would require to be treated at any one time.<br>																However, the centre will house a maximum of 36 patients, and the four health boards have stated that the resources of the centre will help to get these patients back into a normal life.<br>																They have also stated that the new specialised building will serve not only those who require more care and security than they are given in local or state hospitals, but criminals who are in prison and have a mental illness.<br>																A spokesperson from NHS Argyll and Clyde said: &#147;We need to localise mental health services and a secure unit in the West of Scotland for people with mental health problems will ensure that we provide this service.&#148;<br>								<br>								<br>							</span><span class="headline">ALL ABOARD</span><span class="para"><br>																SEA Cadet Training Ship T.S. Royalist visited Cowal last Wednesday, docking at Holy Loch Marina for one night before sailing on to Ardrossan where she changed her crew.<br>																The 32 year old ship was designed by Colin Mudie and specialises in offering sea cadets the adventure and challenge of life at sea, combined with the skills and essential teamwork required to sail a square rigged vessel. Nearly 1,000 youngsters, most of whom are aged between 14 and 16, sail aboard the brig every year.<br>																The ship, which takes kids on trips around the British Isles, started her journey at Inverness before making stopovers at Ardrossan and then on to her home port of Gosport. <br>																Alan Burt, Secretary of the Square Rigger Club - which is a charity that helps provide bursaries for sea cadets participating on the voyage - commented on the scheme: &#147;The chance to set sail aboard this magnificent ship is a fantastic experience for sea cadets from all over Britain. <br>																&#147;We provide finance and help supplement the permanent crew by providing volunteers to help out on the ship. Last year alone we invested &pound;14,000 to help towards the cost of travel.&#148;<br>																Anyone looking to make donations to the charity, or who wish to become a volunteer, can contact Alan Burt on 01875 852300 or write to him at 64 Douglas Road, Longniddry, East Lothian, EN32 0LJ<br>								<br>								<br>							</span><span class="headline">LOCH FYNE OYSTERS SERVED AT HARRODS</span><span class="para"><br>																LOCH Fyne Oysters will be a name rolling off the tongue of the rich and famous next Tuesday, as the company&#146;s produce will be showcased at London&#146;s most famous department store for the &#145;Clearly Caledonian&#146; promotion.<br>																The 10 day event will involve 51 of Scotland&#146;s finest food and drink producers being chosen to take part in the high profile showpiece at Harrods.

Early signs include red blotches, flu-like symptoms and aching joints. <br>																A spokesperson for the Scottish Tourist Board said: &#147;In every tourist information centre in Scotland we supply anti-midge spray and cream for bugs such as ticks. <br>																&#147;We also advise all walkers who intend to walk in the countryside to use these products, as we are aware of the problems that have been associated with ticks.&#148;<br>								<br>								<br>							</span><span class="headline">EURO FESTIVAL</span><span class="para"><br>																ON July 19 almost 1,000 participants converged in Schifflange, Luxembourg to take part in the week long annual European People&#146;s Festival.  Dunoon and Cowal, who represented the UK, sent a delegation of 56 participants to take part in sporting competitions, business exhibitions, culinary and culture presentations.<br>																The Festival celebrations began on Sunday, July 20 with an Ecumenical Church Service, followed by a parade of all 14 participating nations through the streets of Schifflange.  The Parade was a colourful event with each nation displaying their country&#146;s flag and presenting impromptu cultural displays of dance and music. <br>																Following speeches by Roland Hoferlin, President of the Luxembourg Team and Roland Schriener, Mayor of Schifflange, the EU Flag was raised to signify the opening of the Festival and mark the unity of the &#145;People of Europe.&#146;<br>																Sporting events began on Monday with handball and petanque.  The Scottish delegation participated well in the handball competition with Allan Davidson (captain) directing a team who had no previous experience of this fast and exciting game.  As expected, the Luxembourg team dominated this event taking first place with Scotland finishing a healthy 11th place.<br>																The petanque team of Tony Black (captain) and Ricky and Nicky Reynolds fought hard in the petanque competition, playing against experienced European teams and much to their credit finished in a satisfying fifth place.<br>																Tuesday&#146;s sporting competitions were duathlon, football and badminton.  Local badminton stars Gordon McKinven (captain), Paul Turner, Kirsty Turner and Christina English played superbly throughout the day&#146;s competition winning all their games comfortably.  However, when faced with old rivals Luxembourg in a fast and exhausting final they were edged out in a thrilling contest and took second place.  The duathlon team of Adam MacKellar (captain), Elaine and Marie Caldwell and Anthony Andrews gave an excellent performance on a circuit which was tricky for both cyclists and runners.  Luxembourg again dominated this event with the Cowal Europe team taking 13th place.<br>																The football team managed by John Caldwell played some excellent games under very hot temperatures.  Their games were vehemently fought and the team finished an encouraging eighth place.<br>																On Tuesday evening the Scottish delegation presented to a packed hall their much acclaimed cultural presentation overseen by Cultural Convenor Allan Davidson.  The show included performances by Dunoon&#146;s local ceilidh band, &#145;Canned Haggis,&#146; country and Highland dancers, pipers and drummers.  The finale included an alternative Sword Dance to music from the Scottish band the &#145;Proclaimers,&#146; which received a standing ovation by the European audience.<br>																Thursday marked the end of the sporting competitions with tennis, basketball and shooting.  The tennis team of Robert McGregor (captain), Lynn MacFarlane, Paul Turner and Christina English played in a series of singles and mixed doubles competitions.  Their aim was to gain as many points as possible in a 20 minute tie-break.  Again Luxembourg dominated this competition and Scotland finished in ninth place.<br>																The basketball competition met with some unexpected complications, play being postponed due to some of the players being taller than the basket height, and new baskets having to be delivered and fitted!  The Cowal Europe team, captained by Derek Henderson played well under very stiff competition and managed to gain a respectable tenth place.<br>																The shooting competition proved to be an interesting experience, described by the Eurofestival reporters as a &#145;meeting between friends in a loose atmosphere.&#146;  The team of Alan Montgomery (captain), David Marshall and Kirsten Gibb displayed a high level of concentration in this new event and finished a reasonable 12th place in another Luxembourg dominated event.<br>																From Sunday to Friday the business stands were open in the Town Hall Square.  The Scottish stand managed by Pev McChlery, Ricky and Nicky Reynolds promoted Dunoon, Cowal and Argyll and Bute to enthralled Luxembourg inhabitants and festival participants.  Home-made shortbread generously donated by the &#145;Royal Marine Hotel&#146; was available for tasting along with a number of selected whiskies.  Face painting by Karen Gibb, with an emphasis on Scottish culture, attracted many youngsters and parents to the stand.  Amongst the distinguished guests who visited the Scottish Business Stand were the Swedish and Irish Ambassadors who came to support the European People&#146;s Festival and experience the unity and the cultural diversity of the EU.  RTL News covered the business stand arena and televised interviews with participants, organisers and guests.<br>																Each day different countries presented culinary demonstrations in the business stand arena.  On Thursday our cooks Margaret Montgomery and Margaret Caldwell, using Schifflange produce, prepared both trifle and cranachan desserts, eagerly devoured by a fascinated audience.<br>																Friday brought to close a wonderful week with our European friends.  Many friendships had been made and renewed.  Fun events on this day included in-line skating, table tennis, wheelchair basketball demonstrations and chess (on giant chess boards).  One thousand people attended the final dinner and presentations, and the European People&#146;s Festival ended with a fantastic firework display.<br>																The committee of Cowal Europe would like to thank Gordon Higgins; Canned Haggis Ceilidh Band; The Royal Marine Hotel; Dunoon Argyll Pipe Band; Ardentinny Hotel; Bob&#146;s football programmes and Buchanan&#146;s sweets.<br>																In 2004 the European People&#146;s Festival will be held in Upplands Vasby, Sweden.  Adverts will be placed in the Dunoon Observer in December, and anyone interested in participating is encouraged to apply to the committee.</span></p>					</td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td width="42"><img src="../home/spacer.gif" width="32" height="20" border="0"></td>					<td width="500"></td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td width="42"></td>					<td></td>				</tr>				<tr>					<td colspan="2"><csobj w="617" h="56" t="Component" csref="../../Dunoon%20Observer%20Site.data/Components/footer.html" occur="29">							<div align="left">								<div align="left">									<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="2" width="617">										<tr>											<td width="7"><br>											</td>											<td align="center" valign="middle">												<div align="center">													<p class="footer">Contact the Dunoon Observer at <a href="mailto:info@dunoon-observer.co.uk">info@dunoon-observer.co.uk</a><a href="mailto:info@dunoon-observer.co.uk"><br>														</a></p>												</div>											</td>										</tr>										<tr>											<td width="7"><br>											</td>											<td>												<div align="center">													<p class="footer"><a href="../index.html" target="_top">Home</a> :: <a href="../news/thisb.html" target="body">This week;s News</a> :: <a href="../news/lastb.html" target="body">Last week's News</a> :: <a href="archiveb.html" target="body">News Archive</a> :: <a href="../advertising/advertisingb.html" target="body">Advertising</a> :: <a href="../property/propertyb1.html" target="body">Property Guide</a><br>														::<a href="../subs/subsb.html" target="body">Subscriptions</a> :: <a href="../printing/printingb.html" target="body">Newspaper Printing</a> :: <a href="../technical/technicalb.html" target="body">Technical Services</a> :: <a href="../history/brief/brhistoryb.html" target="body">History</a> :: <a href="../technical/technicalb.html" target="body">Contact us</a></p>												</div>											</td>										</tr>									</table>								</div>							</div>						</csobj></td>				</tr>			</table>		</div>	</body></html>
