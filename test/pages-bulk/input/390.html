<p>
Describe the difficulties of Luria's Z (The man with a shattered world)
<br>
and how (to what extent) he overcame them.
<br>
<p>Luria's Z or Zazetsky was once a very clever student studying at a
<br>
Polytechnic Institute in Russia; he was in his fourth year of study.
<br>
&nbsp;However, unfortunately he suffered severe brain damage which destroyed
<br>
his chance of a normal life. His brain damage was the cause of a
<br>
bullet fragment shot into his brain during war. From then on Z
<br>
suffered impairment of vision, loss of memory and ability to speak,
<br>
read and write. The book `The man with the shattered world' describes
<br>
how this courageous man relearns to identify, recall and understand the
<br>
way to speak, read and write.
<br>
<p>Firstly, Z's ability to see was almost completely ruined. His vision
<br>
worked in very mysterious ways. He could no longer see a whole single
<br>
object. Instead, his eyes saw the left side of objects; the right side
<br>
of things didn't seem to exist. For instance when he picked up a spoon
<br>
he could only see part of it. His vision was not the same as yours or
<br>
mine; it was completely different. To him the things others would see
<br>
would just be a swarm of fuzziness. A picture appeared to be upside
<br>
down, inside out, lop sided and any other way it could be distorted.
<br>
If things did seem to be fuzzy, what he did see was only half as much
<br>
as someone else would see; he had a small span of vision.
<br>
<p>Not only were real situations muffled by his vision but so were
<br>
imaginary situations. Z suffered hallucinations because the damaged
<br>
area of the brain stimulated the nerve cells that retain visual
<br>
memories. It was as though the right side of his body didn't exist.
<br>
&nbsp;He couldn't see it so every time he walked along he bumped into walls
<br>
as a result. Vision was just one of the many difficulties Z suffered.
<br>
<p>Due to the brain damage his `sense of body' changed as well as his
<br>
reactions. In fact, he had no sense of his body including other objects
<br>
around him. He loses the sight of his right side because he forgets he
<br>
can't see that side; this is because of t At other times Z was unaware
<br>
of the positioning of his body's parts.
<br>
&nbsp;If he closed his eyes he wasn't quite sure where his right leg was.
<br>
&nbsp;He had to search for parts of his body like separate pieces.
<br>
Surprisingly it was very difficult to show his doctor where his back
<br>
was. In addition he'd forgotten a lot of the names for parts of his
<br>
body; it would take him literally hours to remember. It was impossible
<br>
for Z to point out something quickly because he got all confused. For
<br>
example if the doctor said `Hands on your hips', he would be left all
<br>
bewildered.
<br>
<p>Another misfortune was forgetting how his body functioned like going to
<br>
the toilet and forgetting how to get someone's attention. The time
<br>
when he needed the toilet in hospital was frustrating for Z because
<br>
he'd forgotten how to get the nurse's attention. The physical strains
<br>
were just too much for him as he got tired very easily and quickly.
<br>
<p>Sense of space was another difficulty Z faced. Generally, he had no
<br>
sense of it and couldn't judge relationships between things. He
<br>
perceived the world as broken into thousands of separate parts.
<br>
Misjudging the position of objects was one of his faults. For example
<br>
if he wanted to sit down he would misjudge whereabouts the chair was
<br>
and where he was. The same difficulty occurred with clasping hands;
<br>
he couldn't use his right hand because he couldn't see it. This seemed
<br>
to be a situation of `out of sight out of mind'.
<br>
<p>Difficulties such as these ran into those using objects. Z forgot how
<br>
to use simple things. If he was given a needle and thread in hospital
<br>
workshops he would just sit there for ages to workout how to use them.
<br>
They looked familiar but he just forgot how to use them. More
<br>
misjudgments of the position of objects lead to problems. For example
<br>
when he went to axe a stump of wood he would just hit the floor or his
<br>
foot instead. Things seemed so peculiar to him that he was afraid to
<br>
reach out and touch things in his room.
<br>
&nbsp;He lived in a world that seemed to have disintegrated; the simplest
<br>
things became so complex. Z had to search for everything as Luria
<br>
describes,'he mentally probed each object as though he were a blindfolded
<br>
man groping his way through space'. It was just one big maze for him
<br>
because because he couldn't orient himself in space, tell from left or
<br>
right or gauge distance and relationship between 2 objects. Z couldn't
<br>
even workout where a sound was coming from because he'd lost spatial
<br>
orientation.
<br>
<p>His ability to read also suffered great problems. It would take him
<br>
hours to read something let alone understand it. Once, his family
<br>
bought a new stove; he spent weeks trying to read and understand the
<br>
instruction booklet that eventually he was convinced the stove was
<br>
faulty. His concentration to read was too hard so he avoided it when
<br>
he could. Generally, he couldn't read; he was illiterate and couldn't
<br>
remember the alphabet. However, he attempted to relearn this skill.
<br>
By the third lesson he could remember the letters m and a but not
<br>
immediately; he progressed very slowly. He especially found it very
<br>
difficult to remember the letters s, k and m. So, he tried to
<br>
associate words with them but he could only remember these for a couple
<br>
of minutes. For him to remember words, he found it good to recite the
<br>
out loud. b Reading was very difficult for Z. It wasn't until a few
<br>
months that he knew the whole alphabet; even still he couldn't recall
<br>
it immediately. His visual span was limited so his reading suffered
<br>
subsequently. Z couldn't see an entire word, he had to read each
<br>
letter. In order to read he would have to focus a little to the right
<br>
and above a letter to see it. He could only read three letters at
<br>
a time. Reading was so slow for him ; when he got to the third word of
<br>
a sentence he had forgotten the words before so he'd start again. As a
<br>
result, he read really slowly and became very irritated plus the fact
<br>
that he couldn't read out of his right eye.
<br>
<p>Reading was just part of Z's problem with letters and words. To find
<br>
out he could no longer write was also devastating seeing as he used
<br>
this all the time in his studies. For one the simple task of actually
<br>
holding a pencil was almost impossible. He literally forgotten how to
<br>
do this and write letters. Even if he did manage to write something he
<br>
wasn't in any fit state to read what he'd written.
<br>
&nbsp;The progress of his writing was the same as his progress to read, that
<br>
being slow. It took him six months to read and write with intensive
<br>
practice. Z missed out a lot of the important details out when he
<br>
wrote. Punctuation wasn't present in his writing as he'd forgotten any
<br>
kin of rule. Grammar was another impossible obstacle to get over. The
<br>
injury his brain was left with was couldn't allow him to operate with
<br>
language. Too complex syntactical patterns are far too difficult for a
<br>
patient to grasp who can't even grasp the interrelationships of words
<br>
and workout what they imply. For instance, Z may understand what
<br>
`brother' and `father' mean but wouldn't be able to know what
<br>
`brother's father' meant. He was only able to understand very short
<br>
sentences.
<br>
<p>Writing was such a long painful process. He spent twenty five years
<br>
writing his journal. It would literally take one day to write half or
<br>
one full page. This was because he didn't know how to write. He
<br>
didn't know how to link one sentence with another and so consequently
<br>
wrote disjointed phrases and clauses. His lack of memory affected his
<br>
ability to write. It would take him ages to to remember words; every
<br>
word was on the tip of his tongue. The subject he was actually writing
<br>
about also slipped from his memory. As a result he often repeated what
<br>
he'd written because he'd forgotten he'd already written it. Soon, he
<br>
no longer had the strength, memory, thoughts or ideas to carry on
<br>
writing his life story. In fact, writing took longer and longer towards
<br>
the end of his journal.
<br>
<p>All of these difficulties Z suffered from were due to major loss of
<br>
memory. In the beginning, just after being wounded, he couldn't even
<br>
remember his own name and the village that he lived in. Names would be
<br>
lingering in his mind ready to be spoken, on the tip of his tongue.
<br>
If he actually tried to to remember things he would find it extremely
<br>
difficult to find the right words. But when he didn't happen to be
<br>
thinking of it he suddenly found words coming to him. For example,
<br>
familiar tunes would suddenly appear in his head. Even so, his memory
<br>
was still very bad. It was also shattered into small pieces like the
<br>
rest of his world.
<br>
<p>As Z's memory was so bad, this prevented him from ever studying
<br>
anything he'd once learnt as a student. His memory even affected him
<br>
in every day situations. It was a constant strain for him to think and
<br>
remember the words people spoke and answer back at the same time. He
<br>
was constantly forgetting. Every day simple chores would be delayed as
<br>
a result of his memory. For instance, he would go to the barn for some
<br>
coal and forget the key; but as soon as he went back for it he'd forget
<br>
why he was there. His main trouble was amnesia and forgetfulness.
<br>
<p>Even though his memory was seriously impaired there were some things he
<br>
could remember more than others. He found it far easier to remember
<br>
things from far back in the past like his Kindergarten building. The
<br>
funny thing was he had trouble remembering the recent past. As he
<br>
stated ,'my memories came back from the wrong end'. Instead of recent
<br>
situations being easily remember Z could recollect childhood memories
<br>
with a vivid imagination. Whereas simple common memories such as
<br>
remembering what a cat or dog looked like was very hard for Z. He
<br>
couldn't even visualise faces from his own family but he immediately
<br>
recognised them.
<br>
<p>Generally, Z's previous effort to acquire useful knowledge had been
<br>
pointless. Everything he'd learnt at school had gone. Languages he'd
<br>
learnt at school like German and English had been forgotten. As well
<br>
as using foreign languages his use of arithmetic had also gone.
<br>
Unfortunately, Z had forgotten how to count. He was unable to count
<br>
back change given to him in a shop. All those everyday things that you
<br>
or I find simple, he finds complex. He has to look life very simply in
<br>
a way that a young child would.
<br>
<p>Even though Z has tried for years to improve himself, in reality his
<br>
wound has caused major brain damage. Damaged areas of the cerebral
<br>
cortex could not be restored. Improvements haven't really been made
<br>
although he has adjusted to his body peculiarities but they still annoy
<br>
him if he's suffering an attack. However, problems with `space'
<br>
continued for years. He was unable to orient himself in his own home
<br>
settlement.
<br>
<p>When it came to reading and writing, he did actually teach himself how
<br>
to do these skills again. However, it took a very long time. As you
<br>
know it took him 25 years to write his journal at one page a day at the
<br>
most. The content of his writing didn't really improve as his effort
<br>
to express himself became no simpler. Although, his speaking improved.
<br>
But his world continued to be alien and fragmented. Nothing altered
<br>
his tragic state of memory. So to a certain extent Z never really
<br>
overcame his trouble of memory. Instead he just constantly tried to
<br>
improve things. In reality he was faced with a vicious circle of life
<br>
which had no real end.
