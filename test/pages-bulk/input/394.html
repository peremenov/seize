 a way of meeting the Nation&#146;s energy requirements while also contributing
 to carbon emissions reductions, promoting fossil fuel conservation, and
 reducing other harmful pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide.
 However, renewables can also be more expensive, and by their nature some
 are not always available to meet baseload electricity demands. This paper
 describes the methodology used in the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS)
 for representing electricity generation from wind power, one of the more
 mature and lower cost renewable energy technologies, and one that has been

Existing wind power capacity in the United States today is approximately
 2,000 megawatts&#151;about 0.2 percent of all U.S. grid-connected electricity
 generating capacity&#151;and accounts for about 0.1 percent of generation.</font><a HREF="notes_sources3.html#1"><sup><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF" size="1">1</font></sup></a>
<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
 As a carbon-free technology, however, wind power is increasingly discussed
 for its potential in meeting U.S. and global carbon reduction targets,
 such as those proposed in the 1998 Kyoto accords. Wind technology does
 not have fuel requirements as do coal, gas, and petroleum generating technologies;
 however, both the equipment costs and the costs of accommodating special
 characteristics such as intermittence, resource variability, competing
 demands for land use, and transmission and distribution availability can
 add to the costs of generating electricity from wind.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
The purpose of this paper is to describe how the Energy Information Administration
(EIA) addresses in the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) the natural
 resource, transmission and distribution, and market factors that affect
 the cost of U.S. electricity generation from wind resources. This introduction
 summarizes general electricity modeling in NEMS. The second section, &#147;Representing
 Wind Generating Technology,&#148; outlines the overall NEMS representation of
 wind, including identification of the cost adjustment factors. The third
 and fourth sections, &#147;Basis for Wind Cost Adjustment Factors&#148; and &#147;Cost
 Adjustment Factors for U.S. Wind Supply, &#148;provide EIA&#146;s justification for
 and derivation of the cost adjustment factors. The sections show applications
 of the factors in recent EIA forecasts for wind power, identify key issues
 for further examination, and conclude by summarizing the importance of
 the issue of cost.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
NEMS is an integrated computer model of the U.S. energy economy. It includes
 modules representing all the major supply and demand sectors that produce
 and consume energy. Within NEMS, the selection of new generating capacity,
 including wind, is based on the relative costs of competing technologies.
 Electricity generating technologies compete based on capital, fuel, and
 operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs for providing U.S. regional baseload,
 intermediate, and peaking electric power supply. Intermittent technologies
 such as wind also compete on their ability to meet electricity demand at
 the time winds are available.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
Capital costs for all generating technologies are affected by a number
 of characteristics. Using information from the Department of Energy, the
 Electric Power Research Institute, published reports, meetings with industry
 and technology representatives, and others, EIA estimates the initial capital
 cost for each technology.</font><a HREF="notes_sources3.html#2"><sup><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF" size="1">2</font></sup></a> <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0"> Capital costs decrease as experience with the
 technology increases (learning-by-doing effects), and as domestic and international
 capacity penetrate electric power markets.</font><a HREF="notes_sources3.html#3"><sup><font face="Arial" color="#0000FF" size="1">3</a></font></sup>
</a>
<font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">At high rates of growth, however,
 capital costs may temporarily increase in response to short-term bottlenecks.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
Fuel costs also affect technology competition. For fossil fuels, fuel costs
 are projected separately in NEMS in the individual fuel supply modules,
 providing inputs for subsequent choices among generating technologies.
 In contrast, the availability and cost of wind energy&#151; essentially its
 &#147;fuel&#148; cost&#151;are represented in two ways. First, wind turbine capacity factors
 used in NEMS vary by geographic region, time of day and season, and by
 the estimated energy content of available winds (wind class). Second, experience
 indicates that the energy availability of wind turbines is also affected
 by other factors in addition to region, time, and wind class. EIA expresses
 these additional factors along with others by adjusting wind technology
 capital costs. The derivation of the adjustments is the primary focus of
 this paper.</font></P>

      </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
The methodology for projecting electricity generation from wind power consists
 of a series of data inputs, capacity and dispatch algorithms, and specific
 components for characterizing wind energy supply. Each is discussed below.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<B><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0"><a name="input">Data Inputs</a></font></B></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
The primary data inputs are existing wind generating capacity, future capacity
 planned by electricity producers, wind technology cost and performance
 characteristics, wind capacity factors, and cost adjustment factors. EIA
 collects information on existing capacity and that planned for the future
 from electric utilities and nonutilities, including independent power producers
 and small power producers. Planned capacity commitments include capacity
 under construction, under contract, mandated by law or regulation, or under
 commitment by an electricity producer.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
Mandated new wind capacity in Minnesota and Iowa, as well as estimates
 of new wind capacity to be installed under State renewable portfolio standards,
 are included as planned capacity. In 1999, for example, more than 600 megawatts
 of new wind generating capacity are planned, scheduled to take advantage
 of the Federal renewable energy production incentive before its expiration
 on July 1, 1999. Proposals or goals for new capacity that have not yet
 resulted in firm commitments are not included as &#147;planned.&#148;</font></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
Capital costs for new generating technologies are assumed to decline as
 more units enter service and experience increases. EIA derives estimates
 for the key cost and performance values for wind power from a variety of
 sources, including the Electric Power Research Institute, the Department
 of Energy, other industry participants, and current market data.<a HREF="notes_sources3.html#4"><SUP>4</SUP></a></font></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
In order to meet projected growth in the demand for electricity and to
 replace retiring generating units, new capacity is added over and above
 existing and known plans for new capacity. The essential steps in the methodology
 are to determine future capacity needs based on peak demands, subtract
 current (net of retirements) capacity from those needs, and project the
 types of capacity that must be built to reach the target. The technology
 choice is based primarily on total costs over a 30-year horizon, including
 capital, O&amp;M, and fuel costs. Technology choice is also affected by subsidies
 and taxes, such as those associated with meeting environmental requirements.
 Intermittent technologies&#151; mainly wind and solar&#151;are special cases, because
 they are not always available and thus have a reduced ability to meet demands.
 This problem is resolved by segmenting annual electricity demand into a
 number of &#147;slices,&#148; defined by season and time of day. Wind and solar compete
 directly for new capacity to serve those parts of the load for which they
 are most suited, and they are not penalized by considering overall annual
 demands only, for which they would be too expensive. However, because they
 are not always available, their credited contribution to meet the peak
 demand is reduced, because their inclusion reduces the overall reliability
 of the system. The impact of this reduction is that more fossil-fuel-fired
 capacity may be built to meet the reliability requirements when wind is
 chosen as the most economical technology.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
Unlike fossil fuel technologies that can be dispatched at varying capacity
 factors depending on demand and marginal cost, wind power is dispatched
 in NEMS at specified capacity factors derived by EIA and differing by hour
 of the day, season, region, and wind class. Wind capacity factors are based
 in part on the performance of actual units and in part on the maximum performance
 suggested by research on characteristics of new technologies. In addition,
 some improvement in wind capacity factors over time is assumed as new capacity
 is used and electricity producers learn how to operate their units more
 efficiently.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">

      </P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
Wind energy is the &#147;fuel&#148; for wind technologies. Because wind&#146;s fuel value
 is partly incorporated in capital costs and is not separately priced, EIA
 modifies capital costs for wind projects on the basis of three key characteristics:
 wind class, costs of building new transmission interconnection with the
 existing transmission and distribution network, and cost adjustment factors.
 The cost adjustment factors account for variations in natural resource
 quality, costs of upgrading the existing network, and effects of alternative
 uses for lands with wind resources. For wind resources to be useful for
 electricity generation, the site must (1) have sufficiently powerful winds,
 (2) be located near existing transmission networks, and (3) be economically
 accessible considering additional natural resource, transmission network,
 and market factors.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
Wind technology opportunities are first identified by regional estimates
 of available wind energy. The foundation of EIA&#146;s wind supply characterizations
 is the adaptation of standard wind supply maps provided by the Pacific
 Northwest Laboratory (PNL).</font><font color="#0000FF"><a HREF="notes_sources3.html#5"><sup><font face="Arial" size="1">5</font></sup></a><font face="Arial" size="2">
 </font></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
 The PNL wind data are first expressed in square
 kilometers of land, shown by electricity market region and by wind energy
 class. Wind energy values are grouped among seven wind-speed classes, with
 higher numbers indicating greater energy resources (Table 1). The few class
 7 wind resources are included with class 6 (designated in Table 1 as &#147;6+&#148;),
 and winds below class 4 are generally regarded as not economically useful.
 Recognizing that some lands will not be made available for wind power use,
 EIA has adopted PNL&#146;s &#147;moderate&#148; wind resource exclusion scenario (Table
 2).</font><a HREF="notes_sources3.html#6"><sup><font face="Arial" size="1" color="#0000FF">6</font></sup></a><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
 Applying these criteria, EIA determines U.S. wind resources by region
 (Table 3).</font></P>

As shown in Table 3, the United States has ample wind resources. Figure
 1 shows the potential U.S. wind supply for wind power stations at different
 capital costs (excluding learning effects, improving capacity factors,
 and cost adjustment factors).</font><a HREF="notes_sources3.html#7"><sup><font face="Arial" size="1" color="#0000FF">7</font></sup></a><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
 Although wind technologies are not comparable
 to baseload or other generating capacity, total U.S. wind resources equal
 about three times total U.S. generating capacity and could produce roughly
 twice the nation&#146;s current electric power generation, if costs were not
 an issue.</font><a HREF="notes_sources3.html#8"><sup><font face="Arial" size="1" color="#0000FF">8</font></sup></a><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
 However, U.S. wind resources are heavily concentrated in a few
 regions (the NEMS electricity regions are shown in Figure 2). Nearly 60
 percent of all U.S. wind resources are in the MAPP region, and no economically
 useful wind resources are recorded in FL and MAIN. Further, nearly 90 percent
 of U.S. wind resources are in the least valuable class, class 4. Thus,
 while plentiful overall, the best U.S. wind resources are not necessarily
 near either population concentrations or electricity demand centers.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#0000A0"><a href="images/figws1.jpg">Figure

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
The second step in the characterization limits usable wind energy resources
 to those sufficiently close to existing 115- to 230-kilovolt transmission
 lines. They fall within three distance zones (Table 4). All new generating
 capacity, regardless of technology type, has an associated standard transmission
 interconnection fee, which varies by region but averages about $225 per
 kilowatt. This fee represents the average cost of building a new line interconnecting
 the new generating plant with the existing network. In addition, extra
 costs averaging $5 per kilowatt per additional mile are added to account
 for the greater distance of wind sites from existing transmission networks
 (Table 4).</font></P>

      Lines</a></font></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
Finally, composite cost adjustment factors (Table 5) account for expected
 additional costs confronting actual U.S. wind development. All new wind
 generating capacity in every region is subject to one of five capital cost
 adjustment factors (steps). Capacity in the least-cost steps (steps 1 and
 2) corresponds to the definition of economically accessible energy reserves.
 Capacity in steps 1 through 4 encompasses technically accessible resources
 (at current prices). All capacity (steps 1 through 5) encompasses the total
 wind resource base.</font><a HREF="notes_sources3.html#9"><sup><font face="Arial" size="1" color="#0000FF">9</font></sup></a></P>

      5. U.S. Wind Resources by Region and Cost Adjustment Factor</a></font></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
The cost adjustment factors reapportion each region&#146;s total wind resources
 shown in Table 3. They allow an</font> <font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
initial portion of regional wind resources to be built at no increase in
 capital costs, with increasing proportions constructed at capital cost
 increases of 20, 50, 100, and 200 percent above the base cost.</font><a HREF="notes_sources3.html#10"><font face="Arial" color="#0000A0" size="1"><sup>10</sup></font></a><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
 In the
 NWP region, for example, 7.7 gigawatts of wind resources are available
 at the base cost (itself affected by overall learning, capacity factor
 change, etc.), an additional 13.2 gigawatts are available at 20 percent
 above base cost, 8.6 gigawatts at 50 percent above, and 1.5 gigawatts at
 double the base cost. All remaining resources of the PNL allocation for
 NWP (275.2 gigawatts) are relegated to the most expensive step, step 5,
 with a 200-percent cost increase.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
Learning-by-doing also affects wind technology capital costs. A region&#146;s
 resulting wind technology capital cost depends both on the overall nationwide
 increase in wind capacity, which lowers capital costs through learning-by-doing
 effects, and on the proportion of the region&#146;s wind resources already used,
 which increases costs of further penetration.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
Cost adjustment factors are superimposed on the existing regional totals
 shown in Table 3. As a result, the cost-increasing effects of the cost
 adjustment factors are not evenly distributed within wind classes, but
 first apply to class 6 wind resources until either the resource or the
 weighted proportion is exhausted. Extending the NWP example, the subtotal
 of all 31 gigawatts of wind resources for the region, shown in steps 1-4
 of Table 5, are obtained from the 70.3 gigawatts of class 6+ resources
 shown in Table 3.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
The effect of the cost adjustment factors is to redistribute available
 U.S. wind supplies. Figure 3 shows the redistribution at the National level.

 Clearly the effect of reallocation is to markedly reduce the quantities
 of wind available at all but the highest costs. Whereas wind supplies under
 class 6 designation alone (Table 3) offer nearly 102 gigawatts of least-cost
 wind supply, the effect of imposing cost adjustment factors is that only
 28 gigawatts are in the least-cost step and 41 gigawatts in the next, together
 equaling only two-thirds of the best wind resources in the PNL-based allocation.</font></P>

Separate from issues of turbine manufacturing cost, the supposition of
 plentiful U.S. wind supplies suggests relatively trouble-free siting of
 wind plants in the early years of commercial wind power development. However,
 actual U.S. plants proposed or entering service in the 1990s are confronting
 significant additional project costs, suggesting that unencumbered U.S.
 wind
resources are not necessarily as plentiful as characterized in general
 cost estimates.</font><a HREF="notes_sources3.html#12"><sup><font face="Arial" size="1" color="#0000FF">12</font></sup></a>&nbsp;</P>

First, natural phenomena can impose additional costs on new wind sites.
 Too strong or off-peak winds, storms, freezing, lightning, hail, vegetation,
 erosion, bird and animal habitat requirements, or other natural characteristics
 raise costs, reduce output, or reduce wind&#146;s market value. New wind plants
 in Minnesota, Iowa, Vermont, and Wyoming require reinforcement to cope
 with winter storms and heating equipment to remove ice, which degrades
 performance and forces occasional shutdowns. Texas wind plants confront
 additional costs&#151; both in original installation and in unanticipated replacements
 and repairs&#151;from violent wind storms, tornadoes, hail, and lightning. In
 the West and Midwest, late winter and spring peak winds miss the summer
 electricity peaking demands. In the Northwest, winds tend to be unpredictable.
 Terrain slope and variation also raise costs and preclude developing large
 portions of otherwise attractive new wind sites in Minnesota and Wyoming.
 Steep, heavily vegetated, and difficult terrain eliminate many parts of
 New England and Northwest lands because of both higher installation costs
 for turbines, lines, roads, etc., and higher maintenance costs. Finally,
 coping with insects, birds, and local animals can raise costs or preclude
 current use of otherwise attractive wind areas. Insects coat Midwestern
 wind turbine blades, degrading performance and necessitating more frequent
 blade cleaning, thereby reducing output while increasing costs. Lessons
 learned from bird kills in 1980s California projects has accelerated 1990s
 avoidance of less expensive lattice towers, addition of special coatings
 and markings on turbines, measures to discourage nesting, and in some cases,
 avoidance of attractive windy areas used by migrating birds.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
Second, although EIA accounts for costs of interconnecting new wind plants
 to the existing transmission network, the already loaded network is often
 unable to accommodate additional wind resources in important wind areas,
 thereby raising costs and reducing least-cost wind development opportunities.
 Northern States Power, ostensibly awash in wind resources relatively near
 transmission lines (Table 3), finds the existing in-state transmission
 network loaded and unable to accommodate more than 425 megawatts of wind
 capacity from the supposedly ample Buffalo Ridge wind area.</font><a HREF="notes_sources3.html#13"><sup><font face="Arial" size="1" color="#0000FF">13</font></sup></a><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
 New wind
 projects in Wyoming and in Oregon faced significant cost hurdles in upgrades
 and power transmission charges. Major expansion of western wind power requires
 significant upgrades over a very long transmission corridor, and plentiful
 West Texas and panhandle winds face additional costs for wheeling power
 to major electric power markets in central Texas.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
Finally, additional market preferences for alternative land use increase
 wind project costs and preclude otherwise excellent wind power projects,
 such as in Columbia Hills and Rattlesnake Hills (Washington), Burlington
 (Vermont), and Cape Cod (Massachusetts). In the West and Northwest, environmental,
 scenic, cultural, and religious values effectively restrict or preclude
 wind power development. Protection of birds, of Native American cultural
 and religious values, and of scenic vistas plays prominently in the elimination
 of seemingly excellent wind sites.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
Lack of detailed information precludes separate representation of each
 additional cost in NEMS. However, observation of their effects on new U.S.
 wind plants&#151; along with noticeably higher than expected capital costs&#151;leads
 EIA to conclude that the additional factors need to be represented in the
 wind cost methodology. Literature reviews and contacts with industry professionals
 show that every large wind facility installed in the United States in the
 1990s has been subject to at least some of the forces underlying the factors.
 Moreover, whereas EPRI-DOE estimates indicate that actual installed costs
 for new wind plants should average below $900 per kilowatt by 1999, costs
 for recent large installations appear to exceed $1,200 per kilowatt. For
 example, the 34-megawatt Big Spring project in Texas, reported at $40 million,
 averages $1,176 per kilowatt; a reported $235 million for the 193-megawatt
 wind facility at Alta, Iowa, yields an average cost of $1,220 per kilowatt;
 two new Northern Alternative Energy projects at Buffalo Ridge in Minnesota
 totaling 23.1 megawatts and $32 million average $1,380 per kilowatt; and
 the $60 million 41.4-megawatt Foote Creek Project in Wyoming yields a cost
 of $1,450 per kilowatt.</font><a HREF="notes_sources3.html#14"><sup><font face="Arial" size="1" color="#0000FF">14</font></sup></a><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">

 The NWPPC
 study covers only the states of Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington.
 Nevertheless, it provides a useful exposition of the general shape of a
 likely wind supply function. Figure 4 includes a representation of the
 NWPPC values (converted by EIA to capital costs), with NWPPC wind generating
 capacities doubled to account for the larger NWP region represented in NEMS.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
The NWPPC wind supply function identifies 10,700 megawatts of potential
 wind power available in the four States at a range of costs below 20 cents
 per kilowatthour. Further, the report acknowledges that private developers
 have likely identified other cost-effective sites, and that still other
 sites probably exist, though they are likely small and best suited for
 local loads.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
The NWPPC supply also illustrates limits to accessibility for wind power.
 Of the total 10,700 megawatts, NWPPC estimates that less than 2,000 megawatts
 could be developed at 6 cents per kilowatthour or less (1995 dollars) in
 the absence of a new transmission intertie to Montana. Moreover, the low
 costs would be achieved only if enough wind development occurred to distribute
 the high fixed costs of the necessary transmission upgrades. (Because of
 typically low capacity factors for wind projects, the cost of amortizing
 an increment of new transmission capacity is assigned to far fewer kilowatthours
 for a wind project than for typical fossil-fueled projects, again raising
 costs for wind-generated power.) Finally, although transmission remains
 the most important limiting factor, site viability is also limited by wind
 characteristics, topography, weather, environmental and habitat concerns,
 and land use conflicts.</font></P>

The Minnesota, CEC, and NWPPC studies provide useful information for U.S.
 wind supply estimation. First, they begin to recognize economic constraints
 on some of the most important wind resources in the Nation. Second, they
 both quantify opportunities and identify general reasons for limitations
 in accessing wind resources. As such, they form a valuable base for EIA&#146;s
 representation of U.S. wind power. The three assessments have limitations,
 however, for wider application. The NWPPC study characterizes only part
 of the NEMS NWP region. Moreover, California and the Northwest&#151;featuring
 great distances, large mountains, forests, and significant scenic, cultural,
 and environmental challenges&#151;may not be representative of important Midwestern

The five cost adjustment factors are broad applications of rates of cost
 increase and proportions of wind supplies derived from the Minnesota, CEC,

 assumptions:</font></P>
<UL>
<LI><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
Regional estimates developed by EIA will not exceed estimates made by authoritative
 studies prepared by individual regions. Therefore, the CEC and NWPPC results
 set upper bounds on quantities and costs of economically accessible wind
 resources for those regions. EIA relaxes this assumption somewhat in the
 Northwest, to accommodate both NWPPC acknowledgment of additional &#147;undiscovered&#148;
 resources and adjustments for the larger NEMS region.</font></LI></ul>
<ul> 
<LI><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
There are fewer economically accessible winds (reserves) than technically
 accessible ones. The U.S. Department of Energy indicates that less than
 1 percent of all technically accessible wind resources are economically
 accessible reserves, although technologies have improved since those estimates
 were made.</font><a HREF="notes_sources3.html#20"><sup><font face="Arial" size="1" color="#0000FF">20</font></sup></a><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">

 already exclude some land for economic reasons and assumes a much less
 severe reduction.</font></LI></ul>
<UL>
<LI><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
Least-cost wind resources in every region are assumed to be sufficient
 to meet future wind capacity requirements in the EIA reference case.</font></LI></ul>
<ul>
<LI><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
Wind resource distributions for small regions (those with fewer wind resources)
 are assumed to resemble the CEC distribution; wind distributions in large
 regions are assumed to resemble the distribution of the NWPPC study.</font></LI></UL>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
Examining Table 3 or Table 5 shows two broad regional groups, &#147;small&#148; wind
 regions with relatively few wind resources (less than 25,000 megawatts)
 and &#147;large&#148; wind regions with extensive wind resources (more than 175,000
 megawatts). Given that CNV falls in the &#147;small&#148; category and NWP in the
 &#147;large,&#148; EIA first established distributions for CNV and NWP and then broadly
 applied those distributions to other regions. As a result, ECAR, MAAC,
 NY, NE, and STV follow the CNV example, while MAPP, SPP, and RA follow
 the NWP distribution. Because its winds are considered generally accessible,
 ERCOT is treated as a special case of a small wind region, with higher
 proportions of its winds in lower cost categories.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
EIA employs five discrete cost steps. Steps 1 and 2 represent two cost
 levels for wind reserves, either economically accessible now or in the
 very near future. Reserves plus higher cost steps 3 and 4 yield technically
 accessible resources, those which could reasonably become reserves by 2020.
 Step 5 represents that part of wind resources which EIA does not consider
 economically accessible by 2020 under any normal circumstances. The technical
 potential of 4,460 megawatts set by CEC, for example, becomes the control
 total for steps 1 through 4 in the EIA distribution.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
EIA derives steps 2, 3, and 4 from two sources. First, to be useful, each
 of the cost steps needs to show meaningful cost increases; therefore, EIA
 chose each step to clearly differentiate major cost classes. Second, particularly
 for the initial steps, EIA very broadly applied cost breaks exhibited in
 the NWPPC supply. Finally, EIA chose the 200-percent increase (step 5)
 to separate resources determined extraordinarily unlikely to be economically
 accessible. All PNL wind resources in California and the Northwest in excess
 of the NWPPC and CEC estimates (as adjusted by EIA) are assigned the 200-percent
 increase; similar proportions are then applied to the PNL estimates for
 other regions.</font></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
Using the CEC total as an approximate upper bound for California&#146;s technically
 accessible resources, EIA assigns 4,522 megawatts as the total of steps
 1-4 and the remaining 15,585 megawatts to step 5. Of the 4, 522 megawatts,
 1,710 megawatts representing already installed wind generating capacity
 are assigned to step 1 (reserves). In order to provide opportunities for
 least-cost growth and expansion in the other cost categories&#151;but with no
 information available for the distribution&#151;EIA allocates the remaining
 2,812 megawatts equally across the 4 technically accessible resource steps.
 In effect, the CEC allocation places about 10 percent of wind resources
 in the lowest cost step and about 80 percent in step 5.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
Other &#147;small&#148; wind resource regions are similar but not identical to
CNV.
 The CNV allocation is unusual because of the large already-built component
 and the independently determined CEC bound. Therefore, for other small
 regions, a slightly lower proportion of total wind resources is assigned
 to step 1 and higher proportions are assigned to steps 2-4. Further, recognizing
 that U.S. Department of Energy and other energy resource characterizations
 show increasing resource proportions at higher costs, EIA generally increases
 the wind resource proportions for small regions as costs increase.</font><a HREF="notes_sources3.html#21"><sup><font face="Arial" size="1" color="#0000FF">21</font></sup></a><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
 Finally,
 for all small regions except CNV, EIA increases the four lower cost step
 shares to offset the use of average rather than marginal costs (see below).</font></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
Before applying the NWPPC results to other regions, EIA first adapts them
 to the larger NWP geographic region and then adjusts them to reflect the
 use of average cost steps rather than a continuous cost function. First,
 EIA doubled the NWPPC wind supply estimate for each supply step. The NWP
 region in NEMS is roughly twice the geographic size of the NWPPC region
 (Figure 2). Although the additional States in NWP (Nevada, Utah, and the
 western half of Wyoming) are less well endowed with wind resources than
 the NWPPC region, nevertheless, the NWPPC believes its region also contains
 additional undiscovered wind resources not included in its published wind
 supply. Therefore, to avoid underestimating total wind resources in the
 NWP region, EIA doubled the NWPPC wind supply estimates&#151;from over 10,000
 megawatts to nearly 21,000 megawatts&#151;as an estimate of all economically
 accessible wind in NWP steps 1-4.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
Second, for both small and large wind resource regions, EIA increases the
 lower cost supplies to offset consequences of employing average costs in
 the defined steps. A drawback of step functions employing <I>average</I> costs
 is to overstate the <I>marginal</I> costs of the first units within each range.
 Overstating marginal costs for new technologies could have the effect of
 preventing initial purchases and thereby precluding the entire path of
 investment, learning, lower costs, and additional investment. To compensate
 for such overpricing, EIA reallocates portions of capacity from higher
 cost steps to lower cost ones, including some supply from step 5 into step
 4, and thereby increases total wind supply in steps 1-4 to nearly 31,000
 megawatts.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
The effect of both EIA adjustments to NWPPC wind resources is to greatly
 increase lower cost wind supplies in NWP relative to the NWPPC estimates.
 Whereas NWPPC has less than 2,000 megawatts of least-cost wind supplies
 (including some winds in the Blackfoot Wind Resource area), EIA assigns
 7,653 megawatts to step 1 for the NWP region. Whereas the NWPPC estimates
 yield less than 11,000 megawatts for <I>all</I> NWPPC wind resources, EIA includes
 nearly 21,000 megawatts for NWP reserves and nearly 31,000 megawatts for
 all NWP technically accessible resources in steps 1-4.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
The NWPPC allocation is applied to the wind-rich MAPP, SPP, and RA regions,
 although steps 2-4 are assigned increasing quantities at higher costs to
 reflect the normal shape of supply functions. Step 1 is also reduced to
 reflect the scale of limitations on transmission access demonstrated by
 the Northern States Power experience at Buffalo Ridge. In effect, the NWPPC
 allocation places less than 3 percent of wind resources in the lowest cost
 step and more than 80 percent in step 5.</font></P>

 the other hand, both ERCOT terrain and market conditions appear excellent

 of the case show that the cost adjustment factors can have important effects
 in cases of high demand for renewables, both limiting wind power development
 and also contributing to higher electricity prices. Results suggest that
 very large increases in demand for wind power could exhaust economically
 accessible wind resources in some regions. Despite the technology cost
 reductions from expansion of wind power nationwide, resource constraints
 in some regions (ECAR, MAAC, and STV) result in installed wind costs approaching
 $1,800 per kilowatt by 2020. In California, all technically accessible
 resources (steps 1-4) are used and some step 5 resources are selected.
 In most regions, all least-cost reserves are exhausted. Nevertheless, even
 in this very demanding case, regions with large wind resources appear capable

Given the limited information available, EIA&#146;s wind capital cost adjustment
 factors appear to yield plausible portrayals of increased costs with very
 large increases in wind power demand. However, they also have important
 limitations, particularly when analyses involve major growth of wind power.
 Although EIA is confident that installed costs increase as wind resources

 increases, the <I>extent</I> of cost increases, and <I>interregional differences</I>
 in wind technology costs. The most serious issue affecting the wind capital
 cost adjustment factors is the lack of basic data about the magnitude of
 wind technology cost change as wind resources are used. Lack of basic cost

 both reference case projections with relatively small capacity increases
 and cases of high renewable energy demand. Much more information is needed

Wind resource estimates for ERCOT and California are particularly problematic,
 especially because these regions are significant participants in wind energy
 markets. The challenge with ERCOT is in determining whether its vast wind
 supplies are really available in large quantities at constant costs, or
 whether and at what points limiting factors&#151;such as transmission and distribution&#151;exist.
 The challenge in California is in reconciling CEC resource estimates with
 amounts of already developed capacity, while retaining opportunities for
 additional wind power growth. EIA is working with analysts in both regions
 to determine improved factors.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
EIA&#146;s current approach superimposes the cost adjustment factors onto the
 existing wind class and distance methodology in NEMS. In effect, EIA assumes
 that the best and closest winds are also those exempt from or least affected
 by natural resource, transmission access, and market forces. The higher
 costs are assigned to lower class, more distant, and less likely selected
 wind regimes. For example, in California, all 4.5 gigawatts in steps 1-4
 (Table 5) are from the State&#146;s class 6 wind resource base (Table 3). In
 reality, the factors undoubtedly affect all wind classes at all distances.
 The result of this practice is to understate the costs of developing some
 portions of U.S. wind resources. EIA is considering measures to ameliorate
 these effects.</font></P>

<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
The issue of wind power opportunity is likely to become increasingly important
 in determining future U.S. electricity supply. Understanding wind prospects
 is important in expected &#147;normal&#148; energy futures as well as for possible
 exceptional ones. As wind turbine costs decline and their performance improves,
 the extent to which wind resources, transmission and distribution networks,
 and market forces complement or offset these improvements becomes all the
 more pertinent for near and mid-term electricity supply. If these additional
 factors have little influence, then improved wind technologies may enjoy
 fairly rapid penetration in normal U.S. electricity markets. To the extent
 that economically accessible wind resources are soon exhausted, networks
 are full, or markets are resistant, however, wind power may find itself
 still a marginal source of electric power supply.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
Understanding actual wind prospects becomes all the more important in assessing
 proposed changes in national policy that could dramatically increase the
 demand for wind power. Relatively generous wind resource supplies could
 make policy choices that favor renewable energy technologies more attractive
 and less costly. Restricted wind resource supplies, in contrast, could
 portend much higher electricity prices, greater demands and impacts on
 consumers, and greater impacts on overall U.S. economic growth.</font></P>
<P ALIGN="LEFT"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000A0">
EIA&#146;s use of wind cost adjustment factors formally recognizes the existence
 and importance of additional forces specific to wind technology in assessing
 U.S. wind energy supplies. Moreover, they appear to account in rough fashion
 for the scale of effects of such factors on U.S. wind power cost. Nevertheless,
 the importance of wind resource effects on overall U.S. electricity supply
 highlights the need for improved information about them.</font>&nbsp;</P>
