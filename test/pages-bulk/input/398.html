The pubis bone (part of the structure of the hip) points downwards and to the front in the Saurischians and points downwards and toward the tail in Ornithischians.  The Ornithischian pelvis is wider than the Saurischian pelvis. This may have made Ornithischians more stable while moving.     Ornithischian skulls also had small, reduced openings (antorbital fenestrae) between the eye socket and the nares (nostrils), unlike saurischians.<P>For more infromation on <A HREF="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/diapsids/ornithischia/ornithischia.html" >Ornithischian dinosaurs, click here.</A><BR clear=all><BR><HR><BR><FONT Color="#FF0000"><B>Q: </B></FONT><B>have they ever founddinasaur fossils in Jacksonville, Florida or anywhere inFlorida?</B><BR>from shane h, jacksonville, fl, usa; August 29, 2000<p><FONT Color="#FF0000"><B>A: </B></FONT>No, because Florida was underwater during the time of the dinosaurs.

It is created when crude oil seeps up from deep inside the Earth through a crack, called a fissure.  The less dense elements of the crude oil evaporate, leaving asphalt (a very sticky mess).   Water pooled on the tar, attracting thirsty animals.  As an animal gets stuck in the tar, it probably attract predators.   The animals' bones, teeth, and other hard parts are well-preserved in this environment (but they turn brown from the asphalt).<P>Tar pits are located around the world.  A famous tar pit is the Rancho La Brea Tar Pit (in southern California, USA).  The oldest organism (a wood fragment) found in the La Brea Tar Pit is from 40,000 years ago.<BR clear=all><BR><HR><BR><FONT Color="#FF0000"><B>Q: </B></FONT><B>Where have thefossilized remains of water-dwelling 'dinosaurs' such asplesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs been located ?</B><BR>from KarenS., Gowrie Junction, Queensland, Australia; August 2, 2000<p><FONT Color="#FF0000"><B>A: </B></FONT><A HREF="/subjects/dinosaurs/dinos/Plesiosaur.shtml">Plesiosaurs</A> have been found in England, Germany, France, Japan, Kansas (USA), Queensland (Australia), parts of the former USSR, and other localities that were covered by a shallow sea during the MesozoicEra.  <A HREF="/subjects/dinosaurs/dinos/Ichthyosaur.shtml">Ichthyosaurs</A> have been found in Nevada, Alaska, (USA), Alberta (Canada), the Canadian Arctic, China, Timor, the Alps, Spitsbergen, Greenland, Argentina, England, Germany, and other ancient sea bed areas.<BR clear=all><BR><HR><BR><FONT Color="#FF0000"><B>Q: </B></FONT><B>My four year olddaughter wants to know what was alive before there weredinasaurs.  i thought maybe birds and fish, but i reallydon't know.  she would be tickled to see her answer here.thanks a lot</B><BR>from natalie t, riverview, mi, usa; August 2, 2000<p><FONT Color="#FF0000"><B>A: </B></FONT>There were lots of animals that lived before the dinosaurs, including many reptiles, fish (including sharks), amphibians (like frogs), corals, sponges, insects (like cockroaches and beetles), shell fish, and many others.
