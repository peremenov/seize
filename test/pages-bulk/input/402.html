			<p> Bellow recalls: &quot;Somebody behind me on line yelled, &#145;Oh 
				my God, look at that plane!' We all turned. It was going so fast, 
				we turned and it had gone behind the buildings. The plane itself 
				was blocked by the Woolworth Building, so we couldn't actually 
				see it, but within a few seconds we heard the explosion and the 
				ground shook. It's a moment that will, I think, be forever stopped 
				in time. It was a moment that felt like total silence.&quot;<br clear="all<br>

			<p> Seconds after the first explosion, Kathy Callahan, then acting 
				director of the region's Emergency and Remedial Response Division, 
				telephoned Bruce Sprague, head of the Response and Prevention 
				Branch in Edison, to set in motion the region's emergency response. 
				In those first moments, Callahan believed it was a horrendous 
				accident that might require EPA's involvement because of the smoke, 
				fire, and airplane fuel.</p>

			<p>Many employees witnessed the second plane's impact from their office 
				windows at 290 Broadway, just a few blocks from the World Trade 
				Center. One of them was Deputy Regional Administrator William 
				J. Muszynski, who was acting Regional Administrator for the first 
				three months of the response. &quot;When the second plane hit,&quot; 
				Muszynski says, &quot;there was no question that this was not 
				an accident. You could tell from the way the plane approached 
				that it was no accident. That's when people in the building began 
				to be concerned that perhaps these (federal) buildings were also 
				targeted, and people began to leave the building.&quot;</p>
			<p>While the Manhattan office evacuated, EPA's Edison office geared 
				up.</p>
			<p> Neil Norrell was one of many Edison employees watching the events 
				unfold on TV. &quot;When the second plane hit,&quot; Norrell says, 
				&quot;we just started getting stuff ready. We weren't sure what 
				we were going to do, but we figured we'd be doing something.&quot;</p>

			<p>Within minutes, Sprague dispatched the first crew of Agency on-scene 
				coordinators (OSCs) from Edison to New York City to monitor ambient 
				environmental conditions. OSCs Mike Solecki, Mike Ferriola, Gad 
				Tawadros, and Bob Montgomery were a few blocks away when the first 
				tower began to collapse.</p>
			<p> &quot;Someone yelled, &#145;I smell gas, I smell gas' and everyone 
				began running,&quot; Solecki says. &quot;The dust there was so 
				thick, I couldn't see the hand in front of my face.&quot;</p>
			<p> The OSCs had to scramble just to find where New York City had 
				set up its temporary command center. The city's state-of-the-art 
				Emergency Operations Center had been located in the World Trade 
				Center complex and was destroyed in the collapse, sending the 
				mayor and other top officials scurrying for safety. All radio 
				communications were lost, and the dust was so bad, not even EPA's 
				satellite phones worked.</p>
			<p> Overcoming such obstacles, the OSCs took the first dust samples 
				within an hour or two of the collapse. &quot;We didn't really 
				have a lot of sampling equipment,&quot; Solecki says, &quot;So 
				we went to a local store and bought ziploc bags. We had to do 
				things like that,&quot; he says.</p>
			<p> Muszynski, who returned to his office after sending 290 Broadway 
				employees home and coordinated the Region 2 response through computer 
				contact with Sprague and phone contact with EPA headquarters, 
				points out, &quot;While most people were going away from the site, 
				our emergency crews were coming toward the site. That's part of 
				the initial reaction, and I think it's predominantly because of 
				the training they have about how to respond to a disaster.&quot;</p>
			<p> &quot;It wasn't until weeks later,&quot; Sprague recalls, &quot;that 
				I realized, when I finally had some time to really think, I wonder 
				whether these guys thought about the danger that they were going 
				into. They were going to go through the Holland Tunnel. Well, 
				was the Holland Tunnel going to be blown up? Was there something 
				else that was going to happen? I didn't even think about that. 
				There were so many other things racing through my mind at that 
				time.&quot;</p>

			<p>Later that day, after the buildings collapsed, EPA sent crews from 
				its Environmental Response Team (ERT), also located in Edison, 
				to Brooklyn and Liberty State Park, just across from lower Manhattan. 
				The Brooklyn crew gathered dust and air samples, the New Jersey 
				team only air samples, &quot;because the wind wasn't blowing there,&quot; 
				Muszynski remembers.</p>
			<p> Three Region 2 employees lost family members in the attacks that 
				day. Many others, including OSC Steve Touw, lost dear friends.</p>
			<p> &quot;Father Mychal Judge (the New York City Fire Department chaplain 
				listed as the first casualty of the World Trade Center attacks) 
				actually married my wife and I,&quot; Touw explains. &quot;He 
				had been the parish priest at our church when my wife was in high 
				school and was very actively involved in the parish. So when we 
				got engaged, we immediately called Father Mychal and asked him 
				to come back and do the wedding. When I was driving home on the 
				night of the 11th, I got hold of my wife on the phone and she 
				told me she had heard on the news that Father Mychal was killed. 
				So I took this response very personally.&quot;</p>

			<h3> <b><a name="weekone"></a></b>Week One: Directing the Response 
				from Edison</h3>
			<p> With its lower Manhattan headquarters off-limits for nearly two 
				weeks, Region 2 began 24-hour operations in Edison. By the morning 
				of September 12, the analysis of the bulk dust samples taken on 
				the day of the attacks was completed, showing asbestos levels 
				ranging from non-detects to 4.5 percent (1 percent is the level 
				at which dust is considered to be asbestos-containing). That day, 
				EPA on-scene coordinators established nine monitoring stations 
				in the World Trade Center area.</p>
			<p> Although EPA eventually monitored for hundreds of contaminants, 
				OSC Chris Jimenez, who arrived at Ground Zero on September 12, 
				explains how they first approached the disaster. &quot;The way 
				we started was, OK, we know asbestos is an issue. We know VOCs 
				(volatile organic compounds) are going to be an issue because 
				of the burning. We also knew there are other chemicals that you'll 
				find as a result of fires &#150; acid gases as an example. We 
				knew we were going to want to sample those immediately.&quot;<br>

			<p>Jimenez says that one of the first difficulties was in establishing 
				air monitoring locations. &quot;We couldn't really get very close 
				because the police and fire departments were trying to keep everyone 
				back. It was incredibly smoky. We ended up having to run because 
				there were alarms going off from buildings possibly coming down.&quot;</p>
			<p> From Edison, the Region 2 leadership worked with EPA headquarters, 
				the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and New York city and 
				state agencies to coordinate a multi-faceted response, acting 
				on FEMA mission assignments under the Federal Response Plan triggered 
				by the disaster declaration issued by President Bush the night 
				of the attacks. </p>
			<p> In addition to the monitoring already under way, EPA assumed lead 
				responsibility for hazardous waste collection and disposal, street 
				vacuuming and power washing, and the operation of wash stations 
				for workers and trucks at Ground Zero and the landfill. (Strike 
				Teams from the U.S. Coast Guard's National Strike Force provided 
				enormous support &#150; both manpower and technical assistance 
				&#150; as EPA carried out its mission assignments.)</p>

			<p>Along with its critical role in protecting public health and safety, 
				EPA took part in helping Wall Street get up and running. On September 
				12, EPA began vacuuming the streets, using specially equipped 
				trucks to remove dust and debris from lower Manhattan's financial 
				district. Over the next few days, with help from the Coast Guard, 
				EPA also escorted financial district executives back to their 
				offices to retrieve backup computer system files.</p>
			<p> OSC Andy Confortini explains: &quot;The Bond Market Association 
				would fax over a list of the firms that needed to get into their 
				buildings. We would set up a schedule to meet up with them outside 
				the Ground Zero perimeter, get them onto our vehicles, take them 
				down to their buildings, give them a mask and take them where 
				they had to be to get their backup systems and files. The Coast 
				Guard would go there the day before to evaluate the building for 
				&#145;immediately dangerous to life and health' conditions &#150; 
				combustible gas, low oxygen, high CO2, any kind of volatile organics. 
				They would do that recon and report back to me. There were a lot 
				of natural gas leaks, but there was only one building that we 
				never got into (the Deutsche Bank building adjacent to the WTC

			<p>EPA Administrator Whitman toured Ground Zero on September 13, accompanied 
				by Muszynski. &quot;There was a concern that one or two of the 
				buildings had the danger of collapsing,&quot; Muszynski recalls. 
				&quot;As we were walking down there they had one or two alarms. 
				Can you imagine evacuating and saying, no, it's OK to go back 
				to work, and you go back to work and the alarm goes off and you 
				have to evacuate again? To think about the courage people had 
				to go back in those conditions and still search for survivors, 
				it was incredible.&quot; </p>
			<p> Over the first week of the response, as police, fire fighters, 
				and rescue workers searched for victims amid the rubble and battled 
				the fires that would burn for months within the pile, EPA expanded 
				its ambient environmental monitoring activities, increasing both 
				the number of fixed stations and the contaminants to be probed. 
				On-scene coordinators were also assigned to monitor conditions 
				at the Fresh Kills landfill, where debris from the World Trade 
				Center was transported for sifting by federal crime investigators, 
				including members of EPA's Criminal Investigation Division.</p>

			<p>The chief purpose of EPA's monitoring was to assess health risks 
				for the workers at Ground Zero and for those who would soon return 
				to work and live in lower Manhattan. EPA labs and private labs 
				under contract to the Agency analyzed air and dust samples for 
				asbestos and a host of other contaminants, then turned the data 
				over to an interagency team of scientists. The team included Dore 
				LaPosta, then acting director of the region's Division of Environmental 
				Science and Assessment (DESA). </p>
			<p> The challenge was to determine at which level each contaminant 
				posed a health concern, so that the data could be reported meaningfully. 
				Health-based benchmarks had never been established for many contaminants 
				being monitored. </p>
			<p> For example, no outdoor standards existed for airborne asbestos 
				exposure, which more commonly occurs indoors. Asbestos, a heat-resistant 
				material used as fire-proofing in part of the World Trade Center, 
				is known to cause lung cancer and asbestosis. EPA turned to a 
				nationally accepted standard for asbestos that is based on long-term 
				indoor exposure: the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA) 
				standard of 70 structures per square millimeter, which is used 
				to determine whether children may re-enter a school building after 
				asbestos removal or abatement.</p>
			<p> &quot;Once we got the data,&quot; says LaPosta, &quot;we had to 
				start judging and evaluating it against whatever we came up with 
				as the best parameters. We had to work with the risk assessment 
				people and other people in the field to figure out, for instance, 
				whether the AHERA standard is the right standard and what does 
				that mean from a risk perspective? And what do we do about dioxin 
				&#150; do we use a 30-year removal number, do we use a one-year 
				number, or do we use an OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) 
				number? These criteria issues became a data management and assessment 
				problem we had to work through.&quot;</p>
			<p> Sampling quickly extended from air and dust to water. After a 
				heavy rain prompted concerns that hazardous material from the 
				collapsed buildings was seeping into water supplies, EPA sampled 
				drinking water at 13 distribution points in New York City as well 
				as water pumped out of the Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) 
				train tunnels that flooded after the collapse. Drinking water 
				sampling results showed no contamination and, in fact, the only 
				impact on water detected by EPA was a small amount of temporarily 
				elevated levels of asbestos and other compounds in storm-drain 
				runoff in the Hudson River.</p>

			<h3> <a name="return"></a>Return to 290 Broadway</h3>
			<p> As the financial district returned to operation, EPA continued 
				its vacuuming activities. Bulk dust sampling in and around Ground 
				Zero had indicated an uneven spread of asbestos-containing dust 
				in the area; the Agency decided to vacuum all public spaces throughout 
				lower Manhattan. Coordinated by OSC Dan Harkay, 10 vacuum trucks 
				removed dust from streets and sidewalks, open areas such as parks 
				and sandboxes, and federal building lobbies (including 290 Broadway) 
				into which response workers had carried dust on their shoes.</p>
			<p> With the lower Manhattan cleanup progressing quickly, EPA set 
				a return date of September 24 for employees working at 290 Broadway. 
				In the interim, Muszynski and Assistant Regional Administrator 
				Herb Barrack worked with EPA headquarters to restore the facility's 
				communications capabilities, which were lost when a major telephone 
				switching station was inundated with water following the World 
				Trade Center collapse. They also arranged through EPA headquarters 
				to provide trauma counseling for Region 2 employees, enlisting 
				a Massachusetts-based group with broad experience in counseling 
				disaster victims. </p>
			<p> &quot;The question was,&quot; Barrack says, &quot;should we bring 
				employees right to the regional office or transition by another 
				location first, where they wouldn't be immediately confronted 
				with going back to the horrors that they experienced? We reached 
				consensus that it was better to do it offsite.&quot;</p>
			<p> The voluntary session, held at the Grand Hyatt in mid-town Manhattan, 
				drew more than 600 employees &#150; about three-quarters of the 
				region's workforce. The trauma group also provided counselors 
				for EPA employees re-entering their lower Manhattan offices on 
				September 24.</p>

			<h3> <a name="zero"></a>Work at Ground Zero</h3>
			<p> &quot;The first day you came in,&quot; Norrell says about his 
				on-scene coordinator experience at Ground Zero, &quot;you didn't 
				have any idea what to expect. For the first hour or so you found 
				yourself from time to time just staring at it, seeing and not 
				believing. It was enormous.&quot;</p>
			<p> OSCs assigned to Ground Zero carried out several functions: removing 
				hazardous materials; monitoring environmental conditions in and 
				around the site; establishing on-site wash stations to decontaminate 
				workers and trucks involved in the rescue and recovery; contributing 
				personal protection equipment to the rescue effort; and communicating 
				with recovery workers and other agencies about monitoring results 
				and their implications for health and safety.</p>
			<p> Solecki recalls climbing through gaps in and below the pile at 
				Ground Zero alongside search-and-rescue personnel, beginning the 
				third night. &quot;I went through the hole every night. I worked 
				a lot with the USAR (Urban Search and Rescue) people, and I actually 
				went through with them looking for bodies. That wasn't my purpose 
				&#150; my purpose was looking for hazmats ... I didn't really 
				find anything at first because there was so much rubble.&quot;</p>

			<p>EPA on-scene coordinators pumped approximately 600,000 gallons 
				of oil from the World Trade Center sub-basements and removed a 
				host of other hazardous materials, such as dry cleaning fluids, 
				fire extinguishers, and underground fuel tanks. They also monitored 
				for Freon R-22 leaks from the trade center's enormous refrigeration 
				system, especially when city officials posed the possibility (later 
				disproved) that this particular form of Freon, when combusted, 
				would form the poison gas phosgene.</p>
			<p> Throughout EPA's response, asbestos monitoring remained a top 
				priority. Twice each day, OSCs collected samples from more than 
				20 different fixed continuous air monitoring locations in and 
				around Ground Zero. Of the more than 9,500 samples eventually 
				collected, only 21 measured above the 70-structures-per-square-millimeter 
				level of concern. Even those 21 samples did not reflect a significant 
				long-term health risk. Asbestos exposure generally becomes a health 
				concern when high concentrations of asbestos fibers are inhaled 
				over a long period. Illness is very unlikely to result from a 
				single, high-level exposure, or from a short period of exposure 
				to lower levels.</p>

			<p>Along with asbestos monitoring, EPA sampled the ambient air for 
				volatile organic compounds such as benzene, metals such as lead, 
				and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), dioxin, particulates, 
				silica, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). </p>
			<p> Of particular concern were substances associated with the fires 
				that burned at Ground Zero. Monitoring took place in the smoke 
				plumes each day as the fires burned, and later in the recovery 
				pits and at a number of stations ringing the Ground Zero site. 
				Early on, EPA found elevated levels of some substances in the 
				smoke itself, but these levels tailed off dramatically even a 
				few feet from the source of the smoke. Once the fires ceased, 
				the pollutants fell to either extremely low levels &#150; well 
				below EPA's benchmarks &#150; or to undetectable levels.</p>
			<p> Although the risks were considered short-term, many people, including 
				EPA employees at 290 Broadway, had teary eyes, scratchy throats, 
				and other respiratory problems in the early months while the fires 
				were raging. Members of the public were instructed by EPA and 
				the health agencies to consult their doctors if they were experiencing 
				symptoms related to the dust and smoke from the fires.</p>
			<p> &quot;We were getting relatively high levels of some pretty hazardous 
				chemicals, benzene being the most prominent of them,&quot; Jimenez 
				says. &quot;Right from the vents we were getting relatively high 
				levels, but if you would take a sample just stepping away even 
				a couple of feet, the levels would drop off dramatically. Plus,

				of thousands of respirators and other equipment, using the Agency's 
				own stock and new orders from vendors. Nevertheless, many rescue 
				workers opted not to use the safety equipment.</p>

				you should be putting your respirator on. We put out press releases 
				(advising that Ground Zero workers wear respirators). Having said

				plastics and fuel oils, it doesn't take a bit of common sense

			<p>EPA faced a similar challenge as OSCs worked to install personal

				seven wash stations were in operation at Ground Zero, and five 
				more would be added in the next few days. But without the authority 
				to enforce compliance (the City of New York controlled the site),

			<p> &quot;Many, many conflicts were always going on,&quot; recalls 
				Jim Daloia, Emergency Response Team leader. &quot;The contractors 
				on the site would say, we will build our own wash station, and 
				besides, the site you selected was too far from our equipment.&quot;</p>
			<p> As work continued in October and November, EPA worked to erect 
				a 260-foot by 120-foot central wash station &#150; heated in anticipation 
				of winter &#150; for all Ground Zero workers. The temporary structure 
				provided boot and mask washes, high-efficiency particulate air

			<p>EPA was one of many federal, local, state, and nonprofit agencies 
				supporting the police work at Fresh Kills. The landfill, officially 
				closed to garbage disposal just a few months earlier, became a 
				sifting area for investigators hunting for evidence from the World 
				Trade Center rubble. Mountains of debris were hauled by barge 
				from Manhattan to the landfill during the cleanup at Ground Zero; 
				a separate area at the landfill was dedicated to evidence from 
				Building Seven, which housed FBI files, weapons, and other highly 
				sensitive federal government items.</p>
			<p> Just as at Ground Zero, EPA provided wash stations for workers 
				and vehicles, monitored air and dust for asbestos and other contaminants, 
				and removed hazardous materials. At the landfill EPA also inspected 
				the washing and vacuuming of cars crushed in the collapse and 
				the washing of New York City Department of Sanitation barges. 
				Most of the cars were decontaminated and eventually sent off-site 
				for recycling.</p>
			<p> EPA on-scene coordinators initially set up 10 air sampling locations 
				at the landfill &#150; eight around the perimeter and two within 
				the sifting areas. They later added three off-site locations to 
				make sure the winds weren't carrying contaminants into the surrounding 
				communities. During the course of the landfill operations, EPA 
				took more than 5,200 air samples, finding asbestos above the AHERA 
				standard in less than 1 percent of the samples. </p>
			<p> &quot;We never hit the OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit,&quot; 
				DeAngelis points out, referring to the federal standard for asbestos 
				exposure under OSHA (.1 fiber per cubic centimeter averaged over 
				an eight-hour day), designed to protect workers on the job. The 
				discrepancy between the AHERA and OSHA standards caused confusion 
				among some workers, according to DeAngelis. &quot;When we would 
				come up with a hit on (the AHERA) standard, but the OSHA standards 
				wasn't coming up with a hit because it was less than their level 
				of concern, in the workers' minds somebody was lying to them.&quot;</p>

			<p> &quot;The monitoring system was something EPA can be really proud 
				of,&quot; says Callahan, whom Regional Administrator Jane M. Kenny 
				placed in charge of the response's day-to-day operations. Callahan 
				worked on the monitoring data system with LaPosta and EPA staffers 
				including Joe Cosentino, Nick Magriples, and Mark Gallo, along 
				with city, state, and federal agencies. &quot;It was collaborative 
				and forthright,&quot; Callahan says. &quot;Everyone just kept 
				talking and working together.&quot;</p>
			<p> In addition to responding to the flood of press inquiries &#150; 
				Mears estimates that Region 2 handled upwards of 100 press calls 
				a day in the first week of the response &#150; EPA also reported 
				on its monitoring results at numerous public meetings around the 
				city and in testimony before city, state, and federal committees.</p>

			<h3> <a name="phase"></a>A New Phase Begins</h3>
			<p> As recovery efforts at Ground Zero and Fresh Kills landfill came 
				to an end, EPA halted its activities at these sites as well. Outdoor 
				environmental monitoring ended at Ground Zero in late May and 
				at the landfill several weeks later, and the wash tents came down 
				soon afterward.</p>
			<p> EPA's role in the response has now entered a new phase: providing 
				local residents the assurance that their homes have been cleaned 
				properly. </p>
			<p> In the first several months of the response, EPA urged people 
				who returned to dusty homes and workplaces to have these indoor 
				spaces professionally cleaned. With concerns about indoor air 
				quality lingering into the new year, EPA Administrator Whitman 
				established the Task Force on Indoor Air in Lower Manhattan to 
				address the problem.</p>

			<p>In May, responding to the Task Force's recommendations, Regional 
				Administrator Kenny announced a cleanup plan for residences in 
				lower Manhattan in conjunction with the city, FEMA, OSHA, and 
				New York State. She said in announcing the program, &quot;While 
				the scientific data about any immediate health risks from indoor 
				air is reassuring, people should not have to live with uncertainty 
				about their futures.&quot;</p>
			<p> The voluntary program gives lower Manhattan residents the option 
				of either having their units tested for asbestos or cleaned and 
				then tested by professional cleaners on contract with the government. 
				Residents can also request free HEPA vacuum cleaners through the 
				program.</p>
			<p> During the summer, EPA tested various cleanup techniques in a 
				still-unoccupied building near the World Trade Center site. Testing 
				began on a limited number of the more than 800 units at which 
				residents requested testing only, and EPA anticipates that cleaning 
				of the more than 3,000 units requesting cleaning and testing will 
				begin in the next few weeks.</p>

			<h3> <a name="final"></a>Final Impressions</h3>
			<p> On the day of the attacks, Acting Regional Administrator Muszynski 
				was preparing for a 9 a.m. meeting with officials from Puerto 
				Rico on drinking water issues. For obvious reasons, that meeting 
				never happened on September 11. It was finally held in the summer 
				of 2002 &#150; a sign that life at EPA's Region 2 is beginning 
				to return to normal.</p>
			<p> &quot;Everybody understands how impossible it probably is for 
				us to get back to do the usual things,&quot; Muszynski says. &quot;The 
				Trade Centers are no longer there, so it's a constant reminder. 
				So as the Administrator has said, we will go back to doing the 
				usual things, we just won't always do them as we usually did them.&quot;</p>
			<p> As many Region 2 staffers look back on an unforgettable year, 
				they do so with pride.</p>

			<p>&quot;Are there things we could have done better along the way? 
				Yes, as anyone would expect,&quot; says Barbara Finazzo, who was 
				Acting Deputy Regional Administrator last September. &quot;But 
				I firmly believe we responded in the best way that we knew how. 
				I will always stand by the fact that I'm very proud of what we 
				all did.&quot;</p>
			<p> &quot;There was a lot of dedication, a lot of serious consideration 
				of science issues, a lot of reaching out to people beyond our 
				agency who could provide information about the issues we were 
				dealing with, and a tireless effort,&quot; says LaPosta.</p>
			<p> &quot;I'm proud of the fact,&quot; Mears says, &quot;that a whole 
				group of people from this agency pulled together in a hurry despite 
				being traumatized on all different levels and turned our attention 
				to whether the people in and around lower Manhattan were safe. 
				(And) I'm really proudest of the people who actually went out 
				there day after day after day, on that pile, taking samples, not 
				because they were worried about their own health but because they 
				wanted to make sure we were protecting the health of the people 
				of New York.&quot;</p>
			<p> Norrell may have summed it up best for his fellow OSCs &#150; 
				and, indeed, all EPA staff involved &#150; when he explained the 
				privilege he felt at taking part in the response. &quot;Everybody 
				in the world wanted to do something, and I was getting the chance 
				to do something.&quot;</p>
			<p align="center">****</p>
			<p> True to its mission to safeguard public health and protect the 
				environment, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has 
				been playing a key role in the nation's response to the September 
				11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. With much 
				help from EPA headquarters and other regions, more than 200 employees 
				from EPA's Region 2 offices in lower Manhattan and Edison, New 
				Jersey, have engaged in the response at Ground Zero and the Staten 
				Island landfill where debris was brought for evidence-gathering. 
				Their major activities have included: </p>
			<p>&#149; monitoring air, water, and dust for potential environmental 
				hazards<br>
				&#149; vacuuming dust and debris from streets and other outdoor 
				spaces in lower Manhattan<br>
				&#149; removing and disposing of hazardous wastes from the sites 
				<br>
				&#149; creating an online database to report monitoring results 
				to the press and the public<br>
				&#149; setting up wash stations and providing protective equipment 
				for recovery workers<br>
				&#149; developing a cleaning and testing program for indoor residences 
				in lower Manhattan</p>
			<p> &quot;We were just doing our part,&quot; says Deputy Regional 
				Administrator Muszynski. &quot;We were doing our part, just as 
				the Red Cross was doing its part, the way so many support groups 
				were, the way the Corps of Engineers was doing its part, the way 
				truck drivers were moving material out and doing their part.&quot;</p>
			<p> &quot;Beyond the science and the regulation, beyond the standards 
				and the benchmarks, EPA is at heart about helping people,&quot; 
				says Regional Administrator Kenny. &quot;Our employees proved 
				that every day of this response.&quot;</p>
