<center><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+3>I was born September 30,
1955 at</font></font></b>
<br><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+3>11:07 P.M. weighing 6 lbs 1
1/4 oz.</font></font></b>
<br><b><i><font color="#000000"><font size=+3>I've gained weight since
then....</font></font></i></b></center>

<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>This is a collection--in no particular
order--of my weight at different ages. As you'll see, my body weight was
a defining and persistently pervasive part of my life from a very early
age.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>I am the fat daughter of a fat
woman who desperately wanted to save me from the pain she'd suffered as
a child, including the taunts and hateful messages of inadequacy and undesirability
that came from <i>her</i> mother.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>These words are written to document
<i>my
life experience</i> as a chubby child, fat teenager, and super-sized adult.
There is no blame, and I am not angry at my Mother...This is <i>My</i>
story, and I think it <i>needs</i> to be told. For those of you who are
not, and/or never have been fat, the numbers alone may not provide enough
information or insight. Wherever possible, I am including childhood pictures
which can be viewed by clicking on my age at the beginning of the paragraph.
I will add pictures over time as I find and scan them.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Please keep my story in mind
when judging yourself, or someone you love (which actually, should be one
and the same;-) Teach yourself, and the fat people in your life that their
value should not be determined by their body shape, size or any of a hundred
other variables. Learn to be beautiful, smart and strong on the inside
<i>first</i>.
This will radiate from your center regardless of your physical size, and
<i>everyone</i>
will know how beautiful you are!</font></font></b>

out, <a href="http://www.eskimo.com/~leiba/fatbabyNOT.html">click here</a>
and I will share a few pictures of myself as an infant and toddler.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Age 5: We lived in garden apartments,
and an older boy of 7 named Kevin called me <i>fat</i>. Someone told me
that he drew a picture of me in chalk on the front of the brick building.
It was a crude stick figure with a circle for the head and a larger bubble
for the body. That's the first time I remember being called <i>fat.</i></font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Age 7: During a trip to the doctor
for my usual earache problems, it is decided that I should be <i>put </i>on
a diet. I don't recall my exact weight, but what I <i>do</i> remember is
going home with a piece of paper which inspired my Mom to give me a bowl
of Wheaties with skim milk and <i>no sugar</i> for dinner. The rest of
the family had steak, or hamburgers. I was <i>markedly different</i> from
this moment on.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1><a href="http://www.eskimo.com/~leiba/susan8.htm">Age
8</a>: 88 lbs, I think. I have a clear, but distant memory of being at
my cousin Selma's country home, and she gives me a pair of shorts to try
on. They don't fit, and she tells me that a little girl my age shouldn't
weigh this much, and that if I lose 40 lbs she will buy me all the new
shorts I want...I <i>adore</i> Selma, so I promise to do it--because even
though I'm sure she loves me, I'm somehow certain that she'll love me <i>more</i>
if I'm not chubby. During this same year, I also had diet pills for the
<i>first</i>
time.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1><a href="http://www.eskimo.com/~leiba/susan9.htm">Age
9</a>: 121 lbs. Mrs Wise's fourth grade class is lined up outside the nurse's
office at Ridge Ranch School in Paramus, NJ. We are being weighed, and
when it's my turn, I am logged at 121 lbs. The nurse points out that I
weigh more than even the biggest and strongest boys in the school. I hear
some of the boys in my class laughing and exclaiming "Wow, what a tub of
lard--Mason weighs over a hundred pounds!" This fact is mentioned much
more often than the fact that I learned a monologue <i>in Norwegian--</i>as
well as designing and creating the scenery for the class play--a feat I
personally found much more impressive.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Age 10: 131 lbs. My Mother takes
me to Dr Di Donato because I have an earache. Of course, I am weighed (ear
infections are directly linked to fatness, right?) and when the doctor
comes into the examination room, he shakes his head in disgust and exclaims,
"131 pounds! My nurses don't weigh that much!!!" I am humiliated, looking
to my Mother for comfort--who in turn looks at the doctor and says, "Doctor,
didn't you know? Susan is going to be wearing <i>my </i>clothes to school
this fall!" The doctor seemed to ignore my Mother's remark, but says "We've
got to do something about her," as though I were not even present. I was
given diet pills <i>again</i>, and I remember later that year telling my
teacher that I wasn't taking them, but flushing them down the toilet. I
was proud of that, having read that diet pills can be dangerous...but I
don't think she saw it that way, and though I'm not certain, I think she
might have called my parents and told them. Was I clairvoyant, or simply
"too smart for my own good?"</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Age 11: 156 lbs. My sixth grade
teacher was Miss Fowler, who was a bastion of strictness. She kept me after
school one day to talk to me about the Girl Scouts--from which I'd just
resigned. Miss Fowler told me that I was bright and talented, and oh, yeah--I
had "such a pretty face," but I had to lose weight...</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1><a href="http://www.eskimo.com/~leiba/susan12.htm">Age
12</a>: 166 lbs. Before school started, my Mom took me shopping for back-to-school
clothes. She held up a dress for my approval. I gasped and said "I'm not
really <i>that </i>wide!" My Mother replied, "Yes, you are. We rarely see
ourselves as we really are...the way <i>everyone else</i> sees us.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>It's my first year in Junior
High School. Mr. Cirinelli is my homeroom teacher, and he takes it upon
himself to mentor me in <i>"You'd better lose that weight now, 101."
</i>He
has just lost 66 lbs on Weight Watchers, and encourages me to join. So,
I join the teen group of Weight Watchers that meets in the lunchroom of
Alexander's Department Store on Friday nights. That first night, they weigh
me and give me a report card which logs my weight and progress and also
displays my goal weight, which is 88 lbs. The woman who weighs me in says
"You have to lose a whole person!" I was very gung-ho for a while, but
slipped up--no, I <i>cheated!</i> Mr. Cirinelli warned that I was going
to ruin my life if I didn't lose weight, and my Mother told me that it
was more important for me to stick to the diet than for her...my whole
life was ahead of me, but hers was already settled. She was 42.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1><a href="http://www.eskimo.com/~leiba/susan13.htm">Age
13</a>: I'd just survived the most <i>interesting</i> summer of my young
life. My parents sent me to diet camp in upstate New York. I was almost
200 lbs, but can't recall the exact number. I'd never been to sleep-away
camp before, but I willingly went so that I could transform my life and
guarantee my future happiness through weight loss.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>The short version of this story
is that the camp was a broken down hell-hole, and I responded appropriately
to this situation with Civil Disobedience, a cornerstone of 60's politics
for change! The result? I was expelled from diet camp. The camp director
called my Mother and said "You've got to come and get her...she's got her
whole bunk on strike...girls are refusing to come to meals or go to activities.
Susan has turned this place upside down and disrupted the entire camp!"</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>I was <i>thrilled </i>to be leaving.
I swore I'd stick to my diet and make my parents proud. It had been the
longest four weeks of my life, and it wasn't until we were a few hours
away from the camp that my Mother turned to me in anger and said "We didn't
come to get you because we love you so much. We came because the camp director,
Selma Ettenberg said you'd disrupted the entire camp, and they could not
get things under control until you were gone!"</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>On the surface, I was devastated
and embarrassed...but underneath, I was smiling. It was my first taste
of power, and I knew that I had been <i>right!</i></font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Age 14: 257 lbs. My freshman
year in high school, and the school nurse weighs me in at 257 lbs. I'd
been admitted to Bergen County Vocational &amp; Technical High School in
Hackensack, NJ. My entrance exam scored in the top 10%.&nbsp; My plan was
to study commercial art...but my memories of diets and fat-bashing are
much more vivid than anything I accomplished in my academic career--including
ribbons won in a national Teen Arts Festival, and a very successful performance
in a one-act play competition.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>After the sudden death of a beloved
second cousin from cancer, I was determined to lose the weight "<i>so Marty
would be proud of me." </i>That was my first go-round with Dr. Stillman.
Hamburgers, hot dogs, hard-boiled eggs and cottage cheese, plus 8 glasses
of water a day. I lost about 30 lbs or so before I faltered.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Age16: 311 lbs. In an obesity
clinic at Hackensack Hospital, I weigh in at 311 lbs. The nurse in charge
of my case is very nice. I like her a lot, and she convinces me that I
can do this--maybe even lose enough weight for someone to ask me to the
prom next year. How sad...after all, I didn't know that self-esteem would
have gone a long way in making me desirable. As usual, I lose <i>some </i>weight,
but it's never enough.&nbsp; This is also the year that I auditioned for
the part of Mama Rose in Bergen Tech's production of "Gypsy."&nbsp; Despite
a standing ovation for my audition, I didn't get the part--because of my
weight.&nbsp; I was told that I just didn't fit the image of Mama Rose
because of my size.&nbsp; Oy.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Age 17: 321 lbs. Our family belonged
to a camping club, and one of the people from the <i>Jersey Skeeters </i>was
a woman named Carol. She was well over 300 lbs, with a husband and children
who adored her. Suddenly during the last year or so, she got thin. On Weight
Watchers, of course...so now that I had my drivers license, I joined the
class that Carol lectured. She told me how much everyone in the class adored
me, and how much the rest of the world would, too--once I'd lost the weight.
She wanted to make a giant poster of my "report card" to motivate me and
help the class monitor my progress. Duh. Can you say <i>"Make an example
of me, and humiliate me any way you can?" </i>A couple of months, and I
was gone!</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Age 17 3/4: 356 lbs. My Mother
worked at Castro Convertibles in Paramus, NJ. She was their first female
salesperson, and she was fat.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>One day, I'm in the store to
see her, and I notice this man watching me. I didn't like the way he was
looking at me, but I ignored him because I was in my Mom's place of business.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>That night, she tells me the
strange man was Bob, and he'd taken an interest in me because he'd lost
over a hundred and fifty pounds on Weight Watchers. So...a few days after
high school graduation, I join yet another Weight Watchers group and weigh
in at 356 lbs. Bob assures me that if I do the right thing, I'll lose weight
and someday, maybe even have a boyfriend. If I don't, I'll never be happy.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Age 19: 375 1/2 lbs. I am accepted
for participation in an obesity research program at The New York State
Psychiatric Institute at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York City.
Behavior modification, incarceration and the fear of being integrated with,
or mistaken for a member of the general psychiatric population--<i>These
were a few of my favorite things.</i></font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>I stayed for the better part
of six months and lost 88 1/2 lbs. I was under 300 lbs for the first time
since the age of 16...</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Age 20?: 375ish...again. Following
an automobile accident and serious back injury, I land in a drug rehab
in Miami, FL on May 20, 1976 because my Mother has convinced them that
my compulsive eating is comparable to chemical abuse. <i>I'm admitted because
the paperwork goes through, and the program gets the bucks.</i></font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>This place makes the diet camp
look like paradise. The food is horrendous, the facility (an old motel
just a block off of Biscayne Bay) is roach infested, and worse...and a
self-imposed regimen of arbitrary fasting is <i>easy. </i>Yeah, I lost
weight. And then I regained it...</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Age 22/23: Still in Miami, now
<i>working</i>
in the program. One of the directors decides that I have to lose weight
to set an example for our clients, so under the threat of "lose weight,
or lose your job," I go to Mount Sinai Hospital on Miami Beach and enroll
in the Optifast Program.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>David Kudzma, my doctor is very
cool. He's searing, sarcastic and taunts me, telling me I'll never succeed.
I did though...I lost 67 1/2 lbs, and he admitted that he <i>might </i>have
been wrong. In the long run, he wasn't. And I already had the seeds of
anorexic and bulimic behaviors planted within me. I wasn't drinking my
5 packets a day, thinking that somehow if I cut the 350 calories a day
in half, I'd lose more weight...faster. I ended up in the hospital after
nearly passing out--repeatedly over a period of a week or so. I was too
weak to drive to the hospital, so a friend brought me. I keeled over in
Dr. Kudzma's office. I remember "spiraling" toward the floor, and the next
thing I remembered was wondering how, if I was on the floor, the ceiling
seemed so close...(I was actually being wheeled to the emergency room on
a gurney. I never asked, and don't think I want to know how they got me
up off of the floor.)</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Once I'd recovered from what
was referred to as an "unknown viral thing," I am determined to resume
my diet. I beg for an appointment with a staff surgeon who will perform
a gastro-intestinal bypass on me.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>The surgeon tells me about all
of the risks, presumably to scare me, but I am not afraid. "I am going
to die anyway," I tell him. "Just do it." He refused. I'll bet that's a
record, huh? His name was Dr. Ackroyd and he was at Mount Sinai, too. I
hated him that day...but if I could thank him now, I would.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Age 24: 433 lbs. I couldn't believe
I'd broken the 400 pound mark, and with the blessing of the doctor by whom
I was employed, I embarked on a high protein, low carbohydrate diet. When
that didn't yield long lasting results, I had my jaws wired shut. I lost
about 22 lbs in 8 weeks. Every morning, I beat a raw egg into a glass of
orange juice. I don't know how I survived--physically, or emotionally.
One of the things one must do when their jaws are wired is keep a pair
of wire cutters handy in case the victim--er, dieter, that is, begins to
vomit. The wires must be cut to avoid choking on ones own vomit. (If this
frightens or makes you uncomfortable, good. It ought to. I wish I'd been
frightened instead of desperate.)</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>I had to have the wires cut to
have emergency dental surgery, and chose not to get them re-wired. A year
or so later, I asked a dentist to remove the braces because I had no intention
of being re-wired, and he refused at first. He wanted me to reconsider--and
he wasn't even the one who'd put them in!</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Age 25: 450-500 lbs (approximately)
I couldn't weigh myself, but this is a fair estimation.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Age 26: 425 lbs on the morning
of my Gastroplasty surgery.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Age 27: 321 lbs, and I am now
anorexic and bulimic. Yes, really! I know, because I watched all the talk
shows and read the books. The symptoms said that someone suffering from
these eating disorders is often emaciated, (but not always) The real key
was, and is <i>behaviors! </i>I'm not talking here about "behavior modification,"
or discipline. I'm talking about the self-destructive, self-loathing behaviors
that destroy our bodies and our souls. Self-Esteem is the Penicillin that
keeps these destructive obsessions with dieting and airbrushed physical
perfection at bay.</font></font></b>
