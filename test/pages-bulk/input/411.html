        Awards and Recognitions page of Andrea Michaels&#146; bio
        sheet reads like that of any legendary athlete or
        thespian. To say she has left an indelible mark on the
        event industry would be an understatement. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Entering her
        third decade as an event planner and producer, Michaels
        has climbed to the top of her profession armed with a
        clear sense of purpose and an unwavering event philosophy
        that says if you take the time to truly understand the
        client&#146;s intent, then you hold the key to creating a
        successful and memorable event. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I&#146;m
        famous for saying, &#145;Sell the client what they want
        to buy and not what you want to sell them,&#146;&quot;
        she says. &quot;Every event has a purpose, even if
        it&#146;s not an obvious one. And delivering that purpose
        successfully is the one and only true key.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Michaels&#146;
        ability to conceptualize an event and then exceed
        customer expectations has been her hallmark and a primary
        reason why she has produced events around the world and
        coveted accounts, such as 20th Century Fox, NASA, Pepsi,
        Eastman Kodak, Mercedes-Benz and Microsoft, continue to
        contract her services.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Besides her
        proven track record, Michaels has a background in
        entertainment and holds a master&#146;s degree in
        psychology&#151;both of which play important roles when
        dealing with customers and planning events.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Michaels has
        said that she approaches each function as if it were a
        play, complete with an overture, acts and a finale. Like
        a theatrical production, a Michaels-produced event is
        designed to provide its audience with a sense of
        anticipation, building in excitement and enjoyment before
        finally ending with a distinct and satisfying conclusion.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;I want
        each and every element of any project I&#146;m involved
        in to have content and meaning and a personal experience
        for everyone in the audience,&quot; comments Michaels.
        &quot;In Vancouver (for the opening of GM Place), when
        the owners and managers of the arena said, &#145;I want
        the audience to cry,&#146; I remembered that in each and
        every element. The orchestration of what we did was so
        emotional and impactful that you could watch 22,000
        people weeping as they stood and applauded. It was about
        how the entire event was constructed, flowing and
        building continuously until you could almost see hearts
        pounding with energy, excitement and, best of all,
        emotional investment. Just thinking about it still gives
        me chills.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although she
        is admittedly her own worst critic, which is enough of a
        barometer to judge the relative success of any event with
        which she is involved, Michaels does have a simple
        formula for measuring achievement. &quot;Success is when
        the audience smiles, applauds and, best of all, years
        later&#133;remembers.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The same can
        be applied to an extraordinary Hall of Fame career.</font></p>

                money and flexibility. I answered an ad that
                read, &quot;West Side Entertainment Agency Needs
                Part Time Help,&quot; with this image in mind
                that I would be applying with William Morris and
                casting Sean Connery in his next role. Surprise!
                It was a band leader working out of his

                featured four major events in four days, with the
                largest being for 100,000 people. The most
                innovative was the 3 1/2-hour show, which was
                broadcast live on BCTV and featured more than 750
                entertainers.</font></p>

                company providing sound for a major show just
                didn&#146;t deliver. We had a major comic
                perform, and the audience booed. The entertainer
                walked off the stage. We salvaged it, but it was
                not a pretty moment in my career. </font></p>

        size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">here's
        something about a live audience. Street performers,
        stand-up comedians and stage actors are all drawn to the
        immediacy and intimacy a captive audience provides. They
        thrive on crowd-generated electricity and will sink or
        swim depending on people's instantaneous reactions. The
        same can be said for those involved in event planning and
        production. The hint of danger that every live event
        carries provides an adrenaline rush that would be the
        envy of Evel Knievel or any death-defying X-Gamer. Once
        they taste it, many can't shake it. They're inexplicably
        hooked. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jack Morton
        caught the bug at an early age and, 80 years later, still
        hasn't got it out of his system. Born the son of a
        sharecropper in North Carolina, Morton quickly developed
        a love for theater and stepped into show business as a
        12-year-old, working as an usher, ticket taker, bill
        poster and sometime janitor in a small-town, silent-movie
        house. At 18, he was managing an 850-seat theater and
        helped usher in talking pictures for his loyal clientele.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
        Depression years took Morton to Washington, D.C., where
        he worked his way through George Washington University.
        Before long, he was organizing and booking dance bands
        for school dances, society affairs and even presidents.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">His
        experience in theater and music allowed him to begin
        producing shows for the burgeoning convention industry,
        and in 1939, Morton founded Jack Morton Productions as
        primarily an entertainment production company. Today,
        known as Jack Morton Worldwide, the company has grown
        into a 25-office, worldwide agency, boasting 800
        employees working on four continents.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The company
        has been a rousing success, in part, because it has never
        lost sight of the original ideals Morton instilled back
        in 1939. Then and now, the live experience is the very
        essence of any work the company performs for its clients.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&quot;In
        whatever form it comes-be it theater, a meeting, Webcast,
        or one-on-one conversation-a live experience creates the
        best learning environment,&quot; says Morton, who also
        credits his company's longevity and growth to its ability
        to continually adapt and expand capabilities to meet
        customer needs. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jack Morton
        Worldwide has grown to be a leader in experiential brand
        communications and continues to evolve by utilizing new
        areas such as mobile marketing and Webcasts. Regardless
        of the medium, whether coordinating broadcasts via the
        Internet or selecting music rolls for a player piano, the
        keys to creating a memorable event have remained
        remarkably similar to when Morton first started in that
        North Carolina theater: set measurable objectives,
        respect the brand and engage the audience. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Morton
        continues to champion the latter as the ultimate
        measuring stick for an event's success. At 92, the live
        experience still holds a powerful allure. &quot;The
        reaction of a live audience is real,&quot; he says.
        &quot;There's no better measurement than what you can see
        or hear from a live participant.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"

        80-year, Hall of Fame track record to back him up, who's

        Thompson grew up in a family of eight children. As a
        child, he loved to tinker with the parts from discarded
        vending machines from his father's business. By the time
        he was in the fifth grade, he had created and installed a
        bank of 15 colored spotlights in the wall of his room and
        built a system to play the lights with music, shooting
        color out into the room. As a sophomore in, he designed
        and built a complete lighting system for the stage at his
        high school. Clearly, he had found his destiny early in
        life.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thompson
        founded Images By Lighting in 1983, and was truly one of
        the industry pioneers in the ways he has used lighting to
        enhance, accentuate and add excitement to the world of
        events. &quot;It was always about lighting to me. I loved
        it. It was in my heart,&quot; says Thompson.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When
        Thompson graduated from the University of Central Florida
        with an electrical engineering degree, he says, &quot;I
        decided if I was going to find my destiny, it would be in
        Los Angeles, and I accepted a job offer from Hughes
        Aircraft.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While
        working in Los Angeles, he designed a lighting project
        for a friend in Beverly Hills. His friend's friends
        quickly discovered his talent for lighting, leading to a
        variety of home and commercial lighting projects. Movie
        producer Allen Carr was so impressed with Thompson's work
        in his (Carr's) home that in 1984 he asked Thompson to
        design the lighting for one of his premiers. The success
        of the premier led Thompson to team up with the some of
        the top designers, planners and companies, whose visions
        gave birth to the event industry as we know it today.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Along this
        storied journey to his Hall of Fame inauguration,
        Thompson's projects have taken him to countries all over
        the globe, and across the United States and Canada. His
        expertise, creativity and easy conversational style have
        made him a valued speaker, presenter and lecturer on the
        subject of lighting. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">More
        importantly, many top designers and producers look to
        Thompson when they need their event to be edgy or
        over-the-top! &quot;I work with designers, decorators and
        scenic designers who are creating worlds,&quot; he
        explains. &quot;I am there to support them. I want people
        to see the magic.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thompson and
        Images by Lighting's excellence has earned numerous
        prestigious honors and awards. When asked for advice, he
        says, &quot;I never take so much business that it
        compromises the quality. I always give something extra to
        the client that they did not expect. I do that with
        lighting some aspect of the event that I find is special
        to me. It is my passion to be able to create with
        light.&quot;</font></p>

                going to do. I knew it was going to be something
                with lighting. Lighting was always in my heart.
                Later, in Los Angeles, a friend admired the
                lighting design I had created for my home. She
                asked me to do her home, and that was the first

                night the Santa Ana winds blew the tent from its
                stakes and rolled it with all my lighting into
                the yard. We climbed through the rolled
                structure, took out the lighting and reinstalled

        Joe Goldblatt graduated from college in 1975 with a
        Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in theater and business.
        &quot;I wanted to pursue events as a profession, but
        there was nothing... no official college program... in
        events,&quot; Goldblatt recollects.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He moved to
        Washington, D.C. to work as a &quot;nanny,&quot; and in
        his off time dressed as a mime, performing magic tricks
        for the people waiting to tour the FBI building. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Through
        this, Goldblatt met his wife, Nancy, who taught clowning
        and was a performing artist. He reminisces, &quot;We fell
        in love, got married and started performing as mimes as
        part of the Artists in our Schools program.&quot; For two
        years, they traveled to schools nationwide, but when
        Nancy became pregnant, they decided, &quot; ... it was
        best if we did not travel with our son.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
        Goldblatt's began entertaining at special events held by
        Washington area shopping centers. Their successful
        performances evolved into producing shopping center
        events and starting their own company: The Wonder
        Company, Inc. &quot;Our real motivation was to stay home
        with our child; to have as normal a family life as
        possible.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As The
        Wonder Company grew, they added staff. Goldblatt
        developed training procedures for their staff and
        freelancers. &quot;I developed a training program, so
        that I could manage the business and send trained
        staffers out to produce events while I stayed in
        Washington with my family.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Wonder
        Company grew in size and reputation. Goldblatt again
        found himself on the road, away from his family. So, he
        sold The Wonder Company to a decorating firm in
        Nashville, relocated there and worked for the new owner a
        year. With the downturn of the economy, the new owner
        defaulted and The Wonder Company returned to Goldblatt.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Simultaneously,
        Goldblatt began his career as an expert witness in the
        field of events. As he researched cases, the quantity of
        information available inspired him to develop a
        curriculum for professional event planners, including
        writing the necessary texts for instruction.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1992, he
        began exploring colleges and universities as possible
        sites for this curriculum. The George Washington
        University (GW) deservedly offered Goldblatt a full
        scholarship to earn his master's degree and doctorate,
        plus resources to develop his program, office space and
        library support.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From 1993 to
        2001, the GW program grew from 25 students to 4000.
        Goldblatt then licensed it as the Event Management
        Certificate Program to 20 other universities around the
        world.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When asked
        why he felt so passionately about creating this Event
        Management Certificate Program and the ISES Certified
        Special Events Professional (CSEP) professional
        designation, Goldblatt responded, &quot;I knew that every
        industry, in order to be taken seriously, needs a
        certification program.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 2001,
        Johnson and Wales University, with 15,000 students of
        hospitality, recruited Goldblatt. &quot;They wanted to
        draw on my expertise in events to develop their
        program,&quot; he comments. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Johnson and
        Wales also made Goldblatt the Dean of the Alan Shawn
        Feinstein Graduate School, and today, Goldblatt,
        affectionately known as Dr. Joe, continues to inspire
        hospitality students and faculty alike. Goldblatt is also
        an internationally recognized speaker and has received
        numerous awards for his work, including his induction
        into the 2002 Event Industry Hall of Fame. <br>

        John Daly&#146;s 37-year career, he has created events
        around the world: Paris, Korea, Japan and other worldwide
        sites have been treated to his creative style and
        humanistic appeal.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Daly
        reflects upon his global body of work. &#147;Overseas,
        they don&#146;t do events the same way we do, because
        they haven&#146;t seen it,&#148; he says. &#147;But once
        they see what we are doing&#133;it&#146;s amazing. They
        really get on board once they understand it. You
        can&#146;t translate a feeling, but you can translate
        art. Art has a language of its own.&#148; Daly thrives on
        the interaction with artists of different cultures and
        languages. He thrills at developing the common
        communication between himself and the artists, and
        realizing the vision together.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Who would
        believe that he started as a part-time florist&#146;s
        delivery boy working his way through college?</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#147;I
        happened to be at the right place at the right time. From
        delivering, I began to freelance in floral design. I also
        worked for what they called at that time a &#145;party
        shop&#146; that did a lot of weddings and parties.&#148;</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the early
        to mid &#145;70s, at a time when no such thing existed,
        Daly decided to open his own company, strictly an event
        company. &#147;Everybody thought I was absolutely crazy
        to consider such a thing!&#148; He started with 300
        square feet of workspace. Within four years, he took over
        the whole building, ran a fleet of trucks, and had built
        his team to 35 people.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Daly&#146;s
        team continuously took events to new levels. There were
        no specialty linen companies then; they made their own
        linens. There were no prop houses; they made their own
        props. &#147;People were stunned, totally stunned.
        That&#146;s why it worked,&#148; Daly mused while
        considering the early days.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Beverly
        Hilton, The Bonaventure, The Armitage all welcomed him as
        their florist, while he still had his own special events
        company and warehouse. From his initial venture as one of
        the original event production companies, Daly&#146;s work
        has provided extraordinary experiences: Los Angeles&#146;
        area great events, the State Department, corporate events
        around the world, creating the Papal Altars, and most
        recently, being selected to give roses to the loved ones
        of those lost at the World Trade Center during the
        memorial service.</font></p>

                I worked with Ray Thompson on an event for
                Gillette during the World Cup in 1998. We were in
                Paris, at Chantilly, a place like a miniature
                Versailles. We created Chantilly as it would have
                looked during the reign of Louis XIV. We
                re-landscaped the gardens, installed fountains in
                the lakes, and filled all the urns with floral
                arrangements. The guests swept down on an 80-foot
                by 150-foot long staircase to the sounds of
                baroque music and a water show. The event was two
                years in the making. Then all of a sudden, it was
                there, and it was exactly as we had pictured it.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2"
                face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Worst
                event disaster:<br>
                </strong>The &#147;worst&#148; began as we were
                leaving for an event in Hawaii. I locked my keys
                and the tickets for a crew of 15 in my car, while
                it was still running. Then, on the island, a
                hurricane blew in and tore down every single
                thing we had put up. The rains came. We had roofs
                blown into the tent. I had ordered thousands of
                dollars of foliage for the ceiling. It arrived in
                one small box. So my crew went into the jungle
                with machetes to chop greens. Two minutes before
                the guests were to enter, the power was
                disconnected, and we had to rewire the tent.
                Finally, as we were packing up the boxes to
                leave, a bellman was helping with his box cutter.
                He cut one of my guy&#146;s fingers nearly off.
                We don&#146;t talk about that event.</font></p>

        raised in California, Tom Shapiro began his college
        career in Tucson at the University of Arizona.
        &#147;Initially I was a veterinary medicine major at the
        U of A. But I transferred to USC after creating an
        explosion in a chemistry class that required a building
        to be evacuated. I did much better at USC because I only
        started a fire in the lab there. A woman dropped
        something on my shoe which caught on fire,&#148; says
        Shapiro.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With his
        plans for a career in veterinary medicine gone up in
        smoke, Shapiro changed his major to business. Upon
        graduation, Shapiro worked operations, production and
        sales for his family&#146;s garment business. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He then
        started work for a tent company as a purchasing agent,
        later to become assistant to the owner. Says Shapiro,
        &#147;This was probably just before tents became a major
        event venue. They were still pretty much a &#145;Mom and
        Pop&#146; garage industry.&#148;</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">About three
        and a half years later, he started Academy Tent &amp;
        Canvas with his friend and partner Maury Rice. &#147;We
        started on a shoestring,&#148; Shapiro recalls.
        &#147;Maury&#146;s father-in-law donated an old truck to
        the cause. It was so old that it didn&#146;t have any
        paint on it.&#148;</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Says
        Shapiro, &#147;One of our first customers was a caterer
        who was doing a rock star&#146;s wedding. Our truck
        chugged into the driveway, and just like in a cartoon, it
        collapsed. Smoke started billowing out, the tires went
        flat, the crew jumped off the back. The caterer ran up to
        me and said, &#145;Tom, Tom, promise me everything&#146;s
        going to be OK.&#146;</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#147;We put
        the tent up and the rock star was so pleased she invited
        us all to attend the wedding.&#148;</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Progressing
        from this humble start-up, the 1984 Olympics created a
        major &#147;tipping point,&#148; at which Shapiro and
        Academy provided a lot of tenting. Since then, they have
        done work at three different Olympics, at Super Bowls,
        and in foreign destinations. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2"

        that they take us with them,&#148; says Shapiro.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Regarding
        the work that produced the growth and success of Academy,
        and the high esteem with which event professionals regard
        him, Shapiro says with a smile, &#147;I don&#146;t
        deserve any credit...because you know what? It&#146;s the
        people who work with us that deserve the credit. As an
        owner, I get the credit because I have the title. But the
        reality is, it&#146;s really those people who make it
        happen.&#148;</font></p>

                sewing machines in the parking lot to make
                repairs. And two or three days later everything

        considered the sports world&#146;s special events guru,
        the visionary who has made the Super Bowl the

        Steeg&#146;s Super Bowl team for two decades.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Born in
        Boston, raised during his teen years in Fort Wayne, Ind.,
        Steeg, the son of an engineering professor at Purdue,
        grew up a sports fanatic. His favorite memory? At age 9
        in 1960, he skipped a day of fifth grade so he could sit
        in right field at Fenway Park for Ted Williams&#146;
        final game.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After
        receiving a bachelor&#146;s degree in political science
        from Miami University in 1972, followed by an MBA in
        finance from Wake Forest in 1975, Steeg was unexcited at
        the prospect of working for an accounting firm. He wrote
        to every professional sports team in the country, except
        those in New York. In July &#145;75, the Miami Dolphins
        hired him as an accountant. Within four years, Steeg was
        the team&#146;s business manager.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On Jan. 2,
        1979, then-Commissioner Pete Rozelle handed Steeg the
        newly created position of NFL director of administration.
        Only 28, Steeg took charge of the league&#146;s events
        outside of its New York City headquarters, including the
        Super Bowl, Pro Bowl, AFC and NFC Championships, and NFL
        Draft.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Over the
        years, he has added others, including running American
        Bowl games; managing the Pro Football Hall of Fame
        reunions; overseeing the NFL 75th Anniversary
        Celebration; coordinating the NFL&#146;s made-for-TV
        shows, and handling the NFL Owners&#146; and other league
        meetings.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2"
        face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Steeg is
        responsible for all aspects of the Super Bowl, both
        inside the stadium and out, and before, during and after
        the game. Throughout his tenure, Steeg has implemented
        many Super Bowl-related elements and activities that have
        become staples throughout professional and Olympic
        sports: Jumbotron screens; audio TV broadcasts throughout
        the stadium; individual radios featuring broadcasts at
        every seat; TV access at all concession stands; outside
        entertainment plazas and a corporate hospitality village.
        Also, Steeg directs league-sponsored Super Bowl
        charitable events, raising millions of dollars for
        programs in local host communities.</font></p>

        can&#146;t handle, no stone he leaves unturned.
        &#147;It&#146;s supposed to be fun,&#148; he says.
        &#147;For players and coaches, it&#146;s life or death.
        But we&#146;re not electing a president, and this
        isn&#146;t the end of the Earth. It&#146;s a football

        you stop everything to watch the Super Bowl halftime
        show, spectacular Olympics Opening and Closing
        Ceremonies, or are thrilled by a live event production,
        you experience the legacy of David L. Wolper. In addition
        to raising the bar and setting the standard for live
        event extravaganzas, Wolper&#146;s impressive list of
        credits includes documentaries, sit-coms, docudramas, and
        films ranging from Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory
        to The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, recreating each
        genre in the process.<br>
        <br>
        At the 1939 World&#146;s Fair in New York, Wolper&#146;s
        life changed when he witnessed his first television
        broadcast at the RCA exhibit. TV would shape his future,
        and he would ultimately shape the future of the medium,
        raising the world&#146;s expectations of entertainment.<br>
        Wolper was born in New York in 1928, roughly four months
        after television was first demonstrated. While growing
        up, he earned money selling radishes, delivering flowers,
        and bussing tables. Even then his flair for show business
        manifested itself, as he promoted local big bands and
        held entertainment-connected odd jobs, such as Arthur
        Murray dance instructor, usher at a Broadway theater, and
        seating guests at a stylish canteen.<br>
        <br>
        Although Wolper began college at Drake University in
        Iowa, he transferred to the University of Southern
        California, which at the time housed the nation&#146;s
        only film school. Wolper also played baseball, wrote for
        the university humor magazine and shot photos for the USC
        newspaper.<br>
        <br>
        He showed his inventive humor by showing up uninvited to
        the Academy Awards with a friend who was dressed in a
        gorilla suit. The stunt was part of a publicity campaign
        in which he also produced several theatrical scenarios to
        get students to attend a play written by a friend. <br>
        <br>
        In 1949, Wolper decided to leave school to develop his
        vision for TV. His first entrepreneurial adventure
        involved buying and reinventing documentaries for the
        small screen. These were Wolper&#146;s first steps in
        presenting information as entertainment.<br>
        <br>
        His list of credits is a virtual stroll through history.
        He brought imagination to history and reality to
        imagination. Throughout his career, Wolper has
        implemented new techniques, mixing a variety of media
        into film to properly convey a story.<br>
        <br>
        This year, USC opened The David Wolper Center in
        celebration of his 50th anniversary in entertainment. The
        center contains many of Wolper&#146;s personal and
        professional archives, including scripts, awards,
        business records and physical documentation of events
        that transformed the nation&#146;s psyche.<br>
        Throughout his career, Wolper&#146;s vision, energy and
        innovative spirit have impacted people&#146;s perspective
        and perception of what it means to be entertained. His
        lifetime of creativity has rewarded him with more than 90
        prestigious awards, including three Oscars and 50 Emmys.
        As one of the original visionaries in the industry, his
        legacy is the gift of joy, fascination and wonder.</p>

                American Revolution Bicentennial Administration: <br>
                Staging live events is a prominent part of
                Wolper&#146;s body of work. He was appointed by
                President Gerald Ford to the Council for the
                American Revolution Bicentennial Administration
                in January 1975 to help celebrate the United
                States&#146; 200th birthday. He was elected
                chairman by the organization&#146;s 25-member
                council.<br>
                <br>
                Olympic Organizing Committee:<br>
                Wolper was appointed vice chairman of the Olympic
                Organizing Committee that brought the 1984 Summer
                Olympics to Los Angeles. He transitioned from
                that position to producer of the Games&#146;
                Opening and Closing Ceremonies. <br>
                <br>
                1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympics:<br>
                His ambitious, precisely planned and delivered
                production enthralled the 85,000 spectators as
                well as a worldwide TV audience. Wolper set a new
                standard for participation with 84,000 attendees
                raising their mosaic cards on cue. The 84 baby
                grand pianos thundering the refrains of
                Gershwin&#146;s &#147;Rhapsody in Blue,&#148; the
                soaring flight of doves, the startlingly new
                details, created the biggest show of the century.
                Later, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
                Sciences awarded Wolper the Jean Hersholt
                Humanitarian Oscar for this amazing production.<br>
                <br>
                1986 Liberty Weekend:<br>
                He then produced the 1986 Liberty Weekend to
                celebrate the unveiling of the renovated Statue
                of Liberty and its 100th anniversary. Wolper and
                other top producers and directors created a
                four-day commemoration that included a parade of
                300 ships, a Boston Pops concert, a political
                summit, a concert in Central Park, a salute to
                sports and an extravagant closing ceremony at
                Giants Stadium. The event was viewed by 1.5
                billion people worldwide.</td>
