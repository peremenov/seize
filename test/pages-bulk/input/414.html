		<p><b>Dear Friend,</b></p></FONT>
		
		<p><b>Let me ask you 3 intriguing questions,</b>
		
		<p>1)How can a simple breathing technique 
                  remove 90% of the toxins and help remove fat from your body permanently and make <b>you look and feel 10 years younger</b> <STRONG>without you ever having to cut even a single calorie from your daily diet?</STRONG>?</B>
		
		<p>2)How can you melt away all the fat stubbornly deposited in every nook and corner of your body with the help of natural herbs recommended by Ayurveda medical science <b>like a ball of wax kept on a hot stove?</b>
		
		<p>3)How can you take advantage of these 
                  Ayurvedic secrets <STRONG>Now</STRONG>,to make your Thyroid and Lever keep burning fat automatically for you this very moment without you wasting your time,money and health <b>starving on the restrictive diets like the thousands of innocent,ignorant people ?</b></p>
		
		<p>That almost sounds too far fetched to be true right?</p>
                  <P><b>But what if the answers as you will find below are absolutely,</b></P>
		
		<p>YES..</p>
                  <p>.....YES        and</p>
                             <p>...............<B>YES!</B></p>
		
		<P>Let's just for a moment asssume they are.</P>
		
		<p>What would that mean to you?</p>
		
		<P align=justify>Listen, just imagine if you woke up <B>tomorrow morning</B> and magically 
made it&nbsp; happen. All of a sudden you now know exactly <B>how to burn those fat cells,</B>fire up 
                  your own metabolic organs so that you keep away toxins and fat 
                  from your body permanently,<STRONG>forever</STRONG>                 .</P>
         
         <P align=justify>Would that mean doubling the amount of weight you are currently losing every month.What would doubling your monthly weight loss mean to you? With the same effort you went from 5pounds a month to 10pounds a month,how much more weight can you lose this year?</P>
         
         <P align=justify>Unless you are philosophically opposed to being dramatically more successful 
in losing weight, then you would be hysterically ecstatic to wake up and know 
exactly how to do it with my proven weight loss secrets based on Ayurveda. <B>So you WANT this to happen to 
you today.</B></P>

<P align=justify>And because of the dramatic weight loss results that you get, you would be saving much 
more money that is getting wasted with your current diet plan and supplements.So if you are saving more money then the cost is 
not a question.</P>

<p class="alCenterB"><font color=red>So the real question is...</font></p>
 <p><b>Time!</b></p>
 
 <P align=justify>Can you learn how to make these small lifestyle changes in just one lazy 
afternoon (or night) and see <B>immediate results?</B></P>
<P>That is what you want, correct.</P>
<P align=justify>To sit down for a <B>few hours</B> tomorrow and have these Proven weight loss secrets "magically" transferred from my brain to yours.</P>
<P align=justify>Then be able to make small changes in diet and lifestyle and immediately see (vast) improvements 
in your body, your mind, your health, your shape, your 
looks,your self esteem -- in <B>everything</B></P><br>	

<p class="alCenterB"><font color=red>If I showed you other people, <BR>just like 
you, who are enjoying exactly <BR>what you want...Would you <U>at least</U> 
<BR>believe it is <I>possible </I>for you?</font></p><br>

<p><b>It all began four years back.</b></p>

<P align=justify>I was on a routine visit to my dear friend Dr.Rasik Shah's house.That was the time when I was dejected with my health and the excess fat on my abdomen.</P>
<p>Dr.Rasik Shah is an expert Ayurveda doctor who specialises in dissolving heart blocks with simple herbs.He routinely cures people with complex deseases 
like heart blockages,asthma,blood pressure etc.with his herbs.

<P align=justify>Looking at the amazing success of his Ayurveda Medicinal practice,I enquired him about whether he can do something about my abdominal fat.</P>

<P align=justify>He immedietly said yes,why not?And gave me some simple tips and gave some herbs for quick results.</P>
<P align=justify>As I used these tips and the herbs that he recommended,within 3 weeks the fat started melting away from my abdomen like snow exposed to hot sun and I started feeling more and more energetic,enthusiastic and lighter from inside.</P>
<P align=justify>Looking at this seemingly impossible weight loss experience,I decided to interview him and extract every bit of knowledge he had about losing weight the Ayurveda way.</P>
<P align=justify>As a combined result of this extensive interview and lots of my own studies of Ayurvedic books later,the e-book "Proven weightloss secrets revealed" was born.</P>
<P align=justify>This e-book contains every bit of knowledge that Dr.Shah has about losing fat the Ayurveda way.</P> 
<P align=justify>If you don't know what is Ayurveda.Let me explain...
<P align=justify>Ayurveda is a 5000 year old medical science.
<P align=justify>Ayu" means life,"veda" means science or knowledge.
<P align=justify><b>Ayurveda means science of life. </b>
<P align=justify>According to Ayurveda every body is unique.It has divided different body types into 3 main categories and further sub-divisions. 
<P align=justify>Ayurveda says that what is good for a certain persons body type may not suit your own body type.Hence the first requirement for any weight loss program to succeed is to know your own exact body type. 
<P align=justify>Once this is done,the rest is easy job,Ayurveda has a store house of time tested solutions for every conceivable desease known to mankind,including Obesity.
<P align=justify>This is exactly what my e-book covers in a very simple language so that any body including you can benefit from this powerfull knowledge so far only available to a select few like Dr.Shah.

<P align=justify>Recently I gave this book to hundreds of weight loss aspirants as a test and.....</P>
<p class="alCenterB"><font color=red>What happened next even amazed me</font></p>

 <p>Dozens of letters like these poured in...........</p><BR>

		<br>
		<p align=justify>All the weight loss experts out there preach one thingâ¦. Change your
		dietâ¦â¦ Gulp some pills (<b>read chemicals</b>) and prestoâ¦â¦.. the weight will
		disappear. Too simplisticâ¦. Sadly,<b>it doesn't work that way</b>.</p>
		
		<p align=justify>To truly succeed you need a scientific,comprehensive and cohesive approach, <b class=bandr>that
		works</b>. And it must be designed according to your own <b>bodyâs 
		unique requirements</b>.</p>
				

		<p align=justify>I have included it all in "<b>Proven Weightloss Secrets Revealed</b>". 
		<b class=bandr>There is simply no other alternative</b>. 
		
		<p align=justify>Think about it this way....</p>

		<p align=justify>Mastery of any single <b>STEP</b> would be useless without the other two
		pieces of the puzzle. For example....

		 <ul>
		    <li>
			<b>Without eliminating accumulated toxins</b> from your body, <b>you simply</b>
			<b>can't eliminate fat</b> just by <b>changing your diet</b>. At best you will 
			<b>lose some water</b> making you think that you have lost weight.Which is merely an 
              illusion!
              

		<p>Or </p>
			<li>
			If you have not increased your <b>own bodyâs metabolism</b> by improving/
			correcting the functioning of various organs of your body responsible for
			metabolism, like your Thyroid gland, whatever
			weight you may lose by diet pills/diet plan comes <b>right back on</b> after a while.
             </li>
         </ul>    
		<br>
		<p align=justify>
		Moreover, prolonged use of these diet pills has a <b>lot of side effects </b>and
		I need <b>not</b> tell you what effect<b> yo-yo dieting</b>
		has on<b> your body and psyche.</b></p>
		
		<p align=justify>In both the cases you are finished, and <b>back to the square one</b>.</p>

		<p align=justify>If you want to significantly <b class=bandr>LOSE WEIGHT AND KEEP IT OFF FOREVER</b>...</p>

		<p align=justify>You must fit all three pieces together perfectly! You must excel at <b>all </b>three
		steps.</p>

		<p align=justify>So "<b>Proven Weightloss Secrets Revealed</b>" Ayurveda package includes it all, 
		<b class=bandr>mastery</b> of <b>all three</b> steps.</p>

		<p align="justify">Many people ask this question after buying my e-book. They have it in their
		mind even before they buy it, but once they see the contents, they <b>canât resist
		mailing me</b> with this question.</p>

		<p align="justify">The answer is simple.</p>

		<p align="justify">My dear friend, <b>I know</b> that If you are like most people wanting to <b>lose
		weight</b>, you are struggling just to <b>lose a pound or two</b>. Whether you
		have tried diet programs, diet pills or purchased advise in the form of e-books
		from the self-proclaimed experts, you have been disappointed.</p>

		<p align="justify">The worst part is, with so much how to information in the market, you can
		become paralyzed.... and very frustrated. After a while you realize that you
		are <b>racing against time</b>.</p>

		<p align="justify">While you jump from one diet program to the other, with each passing day,
		you are <b>gaining weight</b> and <b>loosing the battle</b> against obesity and
		the healthy body which is rightfully yours---<b> once you lose control its very
		difficult to come back to track</b>. </p>

		<p align="justify">I honestly hate to think of you <b>wasting a year of your life</b>, and
		thousands of dollars, trying various weight loss products, only to discover
		that your plan was <b>flawed</b> from the beginning.</p>

		<p align="justify">I have analyzed the prices and the contents of several diet programs
		available in the market today. Looking at what these packages offer,
		<b>"Proven Weightloss Secrets Revealed"</b> package
		can be easily sold at $300.</p>

		<p align="justify">But that would put my product beyond the reach of most of the people who are
		really wanting to lose weight.</p>

		<p align="justify">I don't want that to happen. My <b>singular goal</b> is to help as many
		people as possible with this <b>unique</b> knowledge of 
            Ayurveda that I have.</p>

		<p align="justify">With the secrets of Ayurveda contained in the e-book <b>anybody</b> who is serious can
		easily get rid of all the <b>disease risks</b> and problems associated with
		excess weight, and thatâs what motivates me.</p>

		<p align="justify">I deeply want you to succeed <b>now</b>. </p>

		<p align="justify">So just <b class=bandr>grab it now</b>, when itâs within <b class=bandr>
		your reach...before it's too late</b>.</p><br>

		<font size=2 color=blue style="TEXT-DECORATION: underline">Rajesh Shetty</font></A></b>
		<br><br>
		<p align=justify>
		<b>P.S.:There are only 5 reasons not to get "Proven Weight Loss Secrets Revealed" e-book Today:</b>
		<p align=justify>
		<b>1. No money.</b>
		<p align=justify>
		If you are broke,it should be obvious that you are doing something wrong.I don't mean that as judgmental.I've been broke too.But I had to face the reality that *I* was creating my state of wealth or lack of it.
		<p align=justify>
		To make it clear,let's do some simple calculations.If you are on any diet program or supplements currently,how much are you spending yealry? $500..$1000? For what? Just to lose a pound or two that anyway you are going to get back sooner or later.<p align=justify>On the other hand how much are you saving on your yearly medical bills,dietplan,supplement all put together if you are investing just $39.95 in my e-book and follow the Ayurveda principles for healthy living,How much?You do the math...is it $3,000?
		<p align=justify>
		<b>2. No time.</b>
		<p align=justify>
		I am with you here.But you know,I take out time to read,watch cds,vcds,read manuals and books and keep investing in myself.I attribute my perfect health to my ongoing self education.You can read this e-book in a lazy afternoon or night and apply the principles for your own self to stay slim and trim whole life.
		<p align=justify>
		<b>3. No need.</b>
		<p align=justify>
		If you think your current body weight is ok.This e-book will open your eyes to a new way of healthy living that you only dream off.Afterall a perfectly healthy mind and body is definitely a lifetime asset for you.
		<p align=justify>
		<b>4. No interest.</b>
		<p align=justify>
		If you've read this letter to this point,then you're clearly interested in knowing how to lose weight and improve your health.Some people say they aren't interested as a way to cover-up a deeper excuse,often to hide the fact that they don't have money.Well,see #1 above.If you are really not interested,why are you reading this?
		<p align=justify>
		<b>5. No way</b>
		<p align=justify>
		This excuse covers everything from "I resist sales pitches" to "I already have stuff on Ayurveda" to "I already know all that".Yeah,right.They are all excuses.They are coming from people not wanting to have a perfect health,and blaming that on circumstances and others when they get sick.
		<p align=justify>
		You don't have "Proven Weight Loss Secrets Revealed" as it's never been released before.You don't know all that is in the e-book and the bonuses,because even I don't know all that is in it and how the principles really work.<P ALIGN=justify>Remember,these are secret 
                  principles of Ayurveda,a medical science which is 5000 years 
                  old.They work allright but how they really work is still a 
                  mystery.Only a select few practitioners like Dr.Rasik Shah 
                  have an inkling of the mechanics of Ayurveda.Modern science is 
                  busy researching all that is given in these ancient books to 
                  know how they work!.<STRONG>Do you really know it all? 
                  </STRONG>                                                            	
		<p align=justify>
		<b>What's left?</b>
		<p align=justify>
		Unless you have a perfect 
                  body and health and you never visited your family doctor for 
                  the last 3 years, you simply need to take action right now and 
                  <STRONG>grab the package--today</STRONG>
		                   
		           .
		<p align=justify>
		There is absolutely no 
                  risk for you to try out these Proven weight loss secrets based 
                  on Ayurveda and see the results for yourself.If you are not 
                  completely satisfied,take me up on my <STRONG>"no questions 
                  asked" 90 day money-back guarantee. </STRONG>
		                                       
		<p align=justify>
		And if after putting to use the information in this course and it does not at least make you lose 30 pounds in 90 days,I will not only refund your money...I will also give you $500 cash from my own pocket.
