<p>     WARNER:  The Committee will now come to order.  We have before us  a very distinguished
array of aviators this morning.  And our  subcommittee, as the first hearing, leads off with some
of the tough  challenges.  And we welcome you. 

<p>     I'm going to put brief remarks in the record, but just sitting  here thinking back over a lifetime
of my own if I had to figure out,  Senator Levin, one or two disappointments in my lifetime -- the
first  was not achieving Navy gold wings.  But unfortunately World War II had  ended, and they
didn't need a lot of youngsters in the pipeline  anymore and we all went home. 

<p>     But, ever since then I've been highly envious of those of you who  sought as your professions
-- aviation.  It's a very challenging,  high-risk occupation.  I realize, and I think most realize,
every day  you get in that cockpit there's a certain measure of personal risk.    
     I want to thank each of you and tens of thousands like you, where  ever they are today, for
having made this contribution to our nation's  security. 


<p>     The work of this Committee, however, is to try and evaluate the  various programs brought
forth by the commander-in-chief, the  President, to the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretaries
of the Air  Force and Navy.  And therein again, I've had the privilege of having a  good deal of
experience through the years. 
 

<p>     And it's particularly sad for me to address this morning the F-14  program -- a program that
was brought in while I served in the  Department of the Navy, and have spent a good many hours
in the rear  seat of that aircraft in the early days.  But it's a fine airplane.  It has served the country
well.  And I hope that we can put fixes in  to allow it to continue to have service to the nation for
such service  life technically as we can get out of it. 


<p>     The JAST program -- I was sort of sitting here scratching a note  or two -- the challenges here
are almost like going to the moon.  And  this time it's TAC Air.  There's a high technical risk. 
There's a  high financial risk.  And there's a high political risk.   All three  of them are wrapped
up in this program. 

<p>     And we're very anxious to hear from you this morning on that,  General, so I won't take
further time.  We're anxious to hear from the  witnesses, but I'd like to hear from my
distinguished colleague.    


<p>     LEVIN:  We've been together now, we came together some 18 years  ago to the United States
Senate and we've worked side by side.  We've  traveled the world together with pretty
challenging assignments.  And  who knows, with a little luck, we might be sitting here for a
while  longer. 


<p>     WARNER:  Well, I'm privileged to have you... 

<p>     LEVIN:  Well, I agree with that too... 
<p>     WARNER:  ...the ranking member of our subcommittee. 


<p>     LEVIN:  And I just want to thank you, Senator Warner.  It has been indeed a privilege to
work with you for these many  years, and whether I'm Chairing a subcommittee and you're
ranking  member, or you're Chairing and I'm ranking member, we're working on so  many other
things, we've always worked together in a spirit of  cooperation. 
<p>     Some of these people ask me about the U.S. Senate -- it must be  difficult to work in the U.S.
Senate these days.  And I always say,  No, you must be thinking of the House of Representatives,
because we  really work together very well as team in the Senate. 

<p>     And we've alternated whose been the majority over this decade-  and-a-half and regardless of
who's in the majority and who's in the  minority it's worked out very well.  And ours staff have
worked  together consistently, so that's going to be the order of the day  again.  And it's
necessary, because of the challenges we face -- not  as challenging as what you folks have faced
in the cockpits over the  years, but nonetheless, a different kind of challenge, 

<p>     And the Chairman's mentioned a number of them, including a JAST  program and some of
our other acquisitions.  You know, why for  instance, are we buying more F-15s and F-16s at this
time?    


<p>     That's a question that's very much on my mind as to whether that  makes sense for us to do
that.  But I agree with the chairman.  I  think the JAST program is one that we're going to have to
pay a lot of  attention to because of the number of challenges that it presents.    


<p>     I'm interested in the digitization issue as to why we're not  making as much progress with our
situational awareness in the air as  the Army has done with its digitization program on the
ground, which  has given it tremendous situation awareness.  That's something that  this
subcommittee has been pressing for many years, as well.    



<p>     So, Mr. Chairman, I also will put some remarks in the record  which are in more detail.  But I
just want to join you in welcoming  our witnesses and thanking them for their presence, for their 
contribution over the years, and again, saying how much I look forward  to working with you this
year again. 

<p>     WARNER:  Fine.  All right, General.  Turn up the engine.    


<p>     MCGINN:  Didn't preflight this very well.  Can you hear me, sir?    


<p>     WARNER:  Yeah, we can hear you great. 
<p>     MCGINN:  Well, it's an honor to be with you this morning and talk  about issues of such... 


<p>     WARNER:  But you will need to draw that up somewhat...    


<p>     MCGINN:  OK. 


<p>     WARNED:  ...somewhat more closely. 

<p>     MCGINN:  It's an honor to be with you this morning and talk about  issues that are so
important to our great nation, because in my view  they're key to joint warfighting, today and to
our success in the  future.  And that's air power. 

<p>     With your approval, what I'd like to do is submit my opening  remarks for the record ... 

<p>     WARNER:  No objection.  No objection. 


<p>     MCGINN:  ... and in those remarks, as well as in the other  prepared statements that we've
submitted to the Committee, we  addressed those questions you asked in your letter of invitation
to  appear before the Committee. 


<p>     WARNER:  Thank you. 

<p>     EBERHART:  Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, it is a  privilege and a pleasure
for me to appear before you to present an  overview of Naval Aviation's present tactical
capabilities, and our  vision for the future.  I would also to abbreviate my time here and  opening
remarks and submit them for them the record. 

<p>     WARNER:  No objection. 

<p>     EBERHART:  I would like to, Senator Warner, make an offer, if you  can find the time I'll
talk to Admiral T. Ball Hayden, the chief of  our Naval Air Training, and see if we can get you a
slot down there in  Pensacola to come down. 

<p>     WARNER:  I hate to tell you.  I started in the Yellow Peril,  which was the old biplane with
canvas and whatever was in it -- I  don't know.  I do know those days are gone.  Thank you very
much.    

<p>     EBERHART:  Yes, sir. 


<p>       And I'd like to also recount just briefly that I had a phone  conversation this morning with
Admiral Hank Giffen, the commander  of the George Washington battle group.  He's preparing
that aircraft  carrier and his battle group to transit the Suez Canal later on today.  They're en route
to the Persian Gulf to work for the CINC Central  Command. 

<p>     Admiral Lyle Bien  and his battle group on the Nimitz is  steaming across the Indian Ocean en
route to the vicinity of Taiwan,  where they will join Admiral Jim Ellis  and the Independence 
battle group in providing that tremendously capable presence to  hopefully stabilize that area. 

<p>With that, sir, I look forward to answering any questions that you and  the subcommittee
members may have. 
 

<p>     WARNER:  Admiral. 

<p>     STEIDLE:  Sir.  Good morning, sir.  I'm Craig Steidle.  I'm the  program director for the
JAST program. 


<p>     Sir, I thank you very much for your invitation to be here to  discuss the Joint Advance Strike
Technology program, a program that  has just transitioned to the Joint Strike Fighter program. 
Because it  has been so dynamic, I have a short brief statement.  I also have a  more detailed
longer version I'll submit, sir. 

<p>     WARNER:  Well, all statements in their entirety will be admitted  to the record, and you may
proceed with your short statement.   

<p>     STEIDLE:  Yes, sir.  Thank you. 

<p>     Sir, we have matured from the JAST program and are now converging  on an affordable
solution that meets requirements of all three  services, plus our allies -- the Navy, Marine Corps
and the Air Force  as well as our allies.  Specific focus on the program remains  affordability --
reducing the development costs, production costs,  costs of ownership of Joint Strike Fighter
family of airplanes.    


<p>     We've fully merged the advanced research and project agencies,  ASTOVL, Advanced Short
Take-Off and Vertical Landing program, into the  Joint Strike Fighter program.  And additionally
the United Kingdom  Royal Navy has joined the program as a collaborative partner.  They  are
committing $200 million to the program in accordance with the  terms of an MOU that we signed
in December of '95. 

<p>     Interest has been extremely high in other foreign countries.  We've provided several different
briefings, and I expect the interest  to continue at a high level. 

<p>     The program focuses on a new approach for weapons systems  acquisition.  We applied the
recommendations of the Packard commission  and other experts in acquisition reform.  We
created an environment  that provides early interaction between the warfighters and the 
technologists in order to be able to make cost and performance trades  early.  And that's been a
significant part of the program.    


<p>     We've done this by utilizing the integrated product development  team process.  Industry is a
full partner in this process, and they  welcome this tremendously.  They have been very positive
in our  process and our way of doing business. 
 

<p>     The first formal product that came out of this integrated  industry-warfighter technologists
group and teaming relationship was  our initial requirements document that was signed by all
three  services last August, and was submitted, approved and endorsed by the  JROC in August
of last year. 
 

<p>     We continue to be a role model for acquisition reform and  streamlining a lot of initiatives in
coherence with our industrial  partner.  We're just completing the concept definition phase.    


<p>     We'll finish that phase this summer, and then move on into the  concept development phase
where we will downsize from three teams that  we have today to two teams.  Each one of the
teams will build  demonstrators demonstrating commonality, hovering transition, flying 
qualities, as well as continue with our research and development  technology maturation
programs. 
 

<p>     STEIDLE:  Each one of the contractors will demonstrate two  aircraft, and demonstrate the
particular attributes that I just  mentioned.  In conclusion, sir, we strongly... 

<p>     WARNER:  Let's just stop a minute.  That's a total of -- what? --  six aircraft? 


<p>     STEIDLE:  No, sir.  That'll be two aircraft.  We'll downsize to  two concept development
teams, and each one of those teams will fly  two airplanes each. 

<p>     WARNER:  So that's four? 

<p>     STEIDLE:  Yes, sir.  Four airplanes, yes, sir. 

<p>     So, in my concluding remarks, sir, the services stand extremely  committed to the program as
does OSD and industry.  And I stand by to  answer any of your questions, sir. 
 

<p>     WARNER:  One of the questions I will ask -- and I was going to  send this up so you could
read it if you haven't.  I'm sure you have  read the New York Times article. 

<p>     STEIDLE:  Yes, sir.  I have. 


<p>     WARNER:  And I'm going to ask you momentarily if you would sort  of give us a side by
side as to -- it appears to me to be very well  written and researched.  But since it's a significant
piece on this  article -- and I commend the paper and the writer -- I want to make  sure our record
shows any areas of which you as the manager disagree.    


<p>     STEIDLE:  Yes, sir. 
 

<p>     WARNER:  So you have it there. 

<p>     STEIDLE:  No, sir.  I don't, but I do remember the article.    


<p>     WARNER:  Well, I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll get it  reproduced for you and sent right up
there. 

<p>     STEIDLE:  Thank you. 

<p>     WARNER:  General. 

<p>     MAGNUS:  Mr. Chairman, Senator, good morning.  I thank you for  the opportunity to appear
before you to discuss Marine Corps tactical  aviation. 

<p>     I also have, in addition to the formal statement, I have some  short opening remarks which I
would prefer to submit for the record.  And I would like to also add that on behalf of the strong
support of  the Congress and the people of the United States, the Marine Corps has  always been
ready to be -- whether it's forward deployed or on bases  in the United States -- to continue to be
America's 911 force.    


<p>     In addition to the forward deployed forces that Admiral McGinn  has mentioned and, of
course, my Air Force wingmen has around the  world, today you have Marines and F-18Ds and
E-A6Bs poised in Aviano  to support American and allied forces in Bosnia.  There are Marine 
forces forward deployed in Okinawa and on the main islands of Japan  ready to support
contingencies there.  And as our Commandant has  said... 


<p>     WARNER: I visited the Marines in Aviano on my last trip there.    


<p>     MAGNUS:  Yes, Sir. 

<p>     And there are Marines embarked on amphibious ships across the  globe supporting the carrier
battle forces with our Vietnam-era  helicopters prepared to do the nation's bidding. 

<p>     All I can say to echo our Commandant is readiness is our  business.  And we stand by to
answer your questions. 

<p>     WARNER:  All right, gentlemen.  What I would like to do is to  start with you, General
Eberhart. And I presume you've had an opportunity to have reviewed to some  extent the record
of this subcommittee as it reviewed the 22 program  last year.  And our major concern with the
subject of concurrency.  Would you start, sort of as a threshold where we left off last  year, how
the '96 program has unfolded to date, and what you would  hope to do on concurrency issue in
the '97. 


<p>     EBERHART:  Sir, I have reviewed the concurrency issue.  With your  permission, I'd like to
go back just a little bit further though and  talk about -- we were concerned with concurrency
from the very  beginning to make sure that we were going to get this correct.  As such, we looked
at what the Packard Commission said about  concurrency. 
 

<p>     EBERHART:  We think this program complies with the, what was  pointed out in the Packard
Commission.  Rand looked at the concurrency  issue.  They commented favorably in terms of
concurrency in the F-22. And just to make sure that we had it right, as you know, the  Defense
Science Board looked at this issue and submitted a report in  1995, which in our view supports
the fact that it's not too  concurrent. There is some concurrency.  We think there will be
concurrency in  most all programs today.  But we're comfortable with that concurrency.  We
think it's under control. 

<p>     WARNER:  We added to be 70-odd aircraft in operational status  before the last milestone is
completed under -- is it the T&E program?    


<p>     EBERHART:  Sir, before we go to full-rate production, there'll be  70-some-odd airplanes. As
you know, when we looked at the acquisition reform of '94,  they recommended approximately
10 percent, which, if had we stayed  with the original buy of about 700 and some-odd, 10 percent
would have  been 70-some-odd.  But as we've drawn down the total buy, and also  extended the
period of EMD, we think that's a natural consequence that  we will in fact have more airplanes as
we go to full-rate production  than this 10 percent guideline talks about. 

<p>     But we think the important parts -- and they have been, once  again, authenticated by the
reports that we talked about -- is first  of all, the DT&E, which we think is most important, will
be finished  essentially by the time we have four airplanes. 

<p>     WARNER:  For the record, spell out, I know what DT&E...    


<p>     EBERHART:  Development Test and Evaluation. 

<p>     WARNER:  Right. 

<p>     EBERHART:  And then the initial operations test and evaluation,  the Rand Corporation said
most problems unfold between the 10 and 20  percent point in IOT&E.  And we will in fact have
27 percent of IOT&E.  For these reasons, sir, we believe that concurrency is just about  right in
this program.  We'll continue to watch it.  We're concerned  about it just as you are, but we think
it's on the mark. 
<p>     WARNER:  Now, each of the us have different views.  I think it's,  really, one of the highest
rates of concurrency that I've experienced. But that, in your judgment -- and General Fogelman
has testified  this week before this committee -- that degree of concurrency is  driven by the
threat assessment that has been made by a variety of  sources, by traditional sources, such that to
have U.S. air dominance  in the theater, in the time frame when this plane is scheduled to come 
in, it simply has to have that number of aircraft, and that design of  aircraft, to meet that threat. 
Is that a fair summary? 
 

<p>     EBERHART:  Sir, we're concerned about air dominance.  We're  concerned about insuring
that we have air dominance as quickly as  possible.  And in our view, the F-22 does that for us.
But again, when you look at the number of airplanes, the 70-some-  odd, by the time we go to
full rate, if we go back to some of the  other factors we talked about in terms of an extended
EMD in having a  bi-profile that makes sense. 

<p>     WARNER:  Well, but it's the threat scenario that's driving that  quantum of concurrency.  And
that depends on individuals to how you  want to quantify it.  I mean, you very carefully have
quantified it  from a technical perspective. 


<p>     WARNER:  I just quantify it based on past experience.  I mean  this Committee has gone
through a number of aircraft programs that  have not materialized as originally envisioned. Let's
talk about your fly-away costs for 22.  Considering the  changes in the program to date -- and
there has been a reassessment of  weight -- General Fogleman went into that. Did you have an
opportunity to be debriefed on what he said on  weight? 

<p>     EBERHART:  Yes, Sir, I did. 

<p>     WARNER:  To capsule the weight issue, as I recall it, was that he  decided he could make a
degradation in the envelope, and thereby allow  an increase in the weight.  And that degradation
in his professional  judgement would not substantially in any way affect the performance of  this
aircraft to meet the threats. Is that correct? 

<p>     EBERHART:  Yes, Sir.  That's essentially correct.  There's a  little more to it, but that's... 
 

<p>     WARNER:  Well, why don't you put that in? 
 

<p>     EBERHART:  Yes, Sir.  I think that when you look at the weight of  the airplane, it's still
about 2,500 pounds below what we think the  max allowable weight would be for this airplane.
We did look at -- and I think you know, and you referenced the  testimony last year -- that in fact,
at that time, we were concerned  about the weight growth that we had seen to that time.  And
we've  taken very aggressive measures to bring this under control.  And we  think we have today
to include weighing, to reviewing it every other  week, to reporting it to the program manager. 


<p>     We have actually had the opportunity now to weigh some of the  parts.  In fact, we've
weighed about ten percent of the parts -- the  actual parts that we've cut -- and we're plus 30
pounds out of this  whole 3,000 pounds that we've weighed. And then when we've look at
avionics, we've weighed hundreds of  pieces and we're minus ten pounds. So we think we have
good understanding that our model is on  track. 
 

<p>     The situation you're talking about is where we looked at the  weight that we had at that time,
and what it was going to take in  terms of thrust to get us the G available at 1.0 on the
performance  curve. 

<p>     We looked at what that would cost us in terms of dollars to  insure a very small change in G
available.  I'm talking .0 something  in terms of Gs.  Very negligible.  We looked at what that
meant in  terms of operational capability.  And we believed that was negligible  -- and it wasn't
just the Air Force, Sir, we vetted this and vetted  this through the JROC process with the other
vice chiefs, the vice  chairman and the chairman and the CINCs to make sure everyone 
understood what this meant -- negligible in terms of operational  capability. I guess the bottom
line is we looked at it based on what it would  cost us to keep that .0X amount of Gs at this one
point on the  performance curve, and we didn't think the cost was worth it.    


<p>     WARNER:  Let's return momentarily and then I'll yield to my  colleague.  About the fly-away
cost, what do you estimate the fly-away  cost of 22 in the fiscal '96 dollars? 
 

<p>     EBERHART:  Sir, I'll -- I get the fly-away costs confused a  little bit here, so let me make
sure that I understand it.  I think  it's around $70 million, but let me check that for you to make
sure I  have it right. 
  

<p>     It's $71.2, Sir.  For the record, $71.2. 


<p>     WARNER:  $71.2. 


<p>     EBERHART:  Yes, Sir. 

<p>     WARNER:  And that's predicated on 442 units? 



<p>     EBERHART:  Yes, Sir. 

<p>     WARNER:  Senator Levin. 
  

<p>     LEVIN:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
 

<p>     LEVIN:  On the F-22 concurrency issue first.  Is there more or  less concurrency with the
reduced buy? 


<p>     EBERHART:  Sir, in terms of the reduced buy, coupled with  stretching out EMD, there is
less concurrency. 


<p>     LEVIN:  So that even though we're buying a greater percentage --  put it -- no -- even though
the full rate production of the F-22 is  for a smaller percentage of the total buy, the concurrency
has  actually been reduced. 

<p>     EBERHART:  Sir, I believe that once you stretch out EMD, and you  have longer to work
these issues and the IOC moves right -- the  initial operation capability -- and you have more
time to work this  test and evaluation phase, that that reduces the concurrency.    


<p>     LEVIN:  Now you, in answer to the Chairman's question as to  whether or not the schedule
for the F-22 is threat driven, answered,  as I understand it, that it is in fact not being driven by the
threat.  But I'd like you to put that in your own words. 

<p>     Are we producing this based on what is a proper, safe, rate of  development, or are we
producing this quicker than that in order to  meet some kind of a presumed threat that we're
going to face in the  out years? 

<p>     EBERHART:  Sir, I think that in every case, this is a balance  between the threat that we
anticipate and what we think is acceptable  concurrency, and acceptable and affordable rate of
production. So I think we balance those two things, and that's how we decide  what the IOC is. 

<p>     LEVIN:  Has the concurrency rate changed in the last two years  for the F-22? 
 

<p>     EBERHART:  Sir, I have not addressed a question specifically like  that, and I'm not an
acquisition expert. I will provide for the record my view that we have stretched out  EMD over
the last couple of years.  We've moved the IOC right.  So to  me, as an operator, that means that
the concurrency -- it's not as  concurrent. Now I'll have to ask the acquisition experts if they
agree, if  their definition of concurrency is the same as mine. 
 

<p>     LEVIN:  OK.  So that from your operator's perspective, there's  less concurrency now in this
program than there was two years ago?    


<p>     EBERHART:  That would be my view as an operator.  Yes, Sir.    


<p>     LEVIN:  I think it would be useful to give us those charts  showing us those timelines
comparing for us the milestones that exist  now to what they looked like two years ago.  I think it
would be  helpful... 
 

<p>     EBERHART:  Yes, Sir. 


<p>     LEVIN:  ... to do that for the record. Now the Science Board found that for the F-22, that
engine  development and passive avionics were the highest risk areas in terms  of concurrency. 
 

<p>     EBERHART:  Yes, Sir. 


<p>     LEVIN:  Could you comment on that? 

<p>     EBELHART:  Yes, sir.  And, in fact, I had the privilege of going  down to Pratt & Whitney at
West Palm a couple of weeks ago and looking  at the engine on the stand and receiving extensive
briefings on where  they were a year ago -- and where they were two years ago and where  they
are. 

<p>     It's very impressive, the steps they have taken to make sure that  this airplane and the engine
will be ready for a first flight in May  of '97.  And I'm convinced it will.  But the types of
redesign we have  done to include the advances with the Howell  blade, we're  convinced that
that will in fact work.  It has tested so well on the  test band, on the test stand, and it's a go for
May of '97 for the  maiden flight. 
 

<p>     LEVIN:  The science board report indicated that about 20 percent  of the avionics testing was
going to be completed before the Lot 2   contract award.  And as I understand, Lot 2  begins at
what  plane?  Give me their... 

<p>     EBERHART:  Sir, I don't have that in front of me.  We'll see if  we can get it behind here, if
not, we will submit that for the record.    


<p>     LEVIN:  OK.  Well, my question doesn't depend on the answer to  that.  So whatever the
plane number is where Lot 2  begins, it was  our understanding from the science board report that
the avionics  testing would be 20 percent completed before that point.  OK?  Now, in  terms of
the engine testing, we did not have a specific number.  Do  you know what that number is? In
other words, what percentage of the engine testing was to be  completed prior to Lot 2 
production? 
 

<p>     EBERHART:  I do not know, sir.  I'll have to submit that for the  record. 
 

<p>     LEVIN:  OK.  That'll be fine.  Do you know how much of the  testing, the engine testing, is
going to be actual testing as compared  to modeling and simulation?  Is that something you
would know off-  hand? 

<p>     EBERHART:  No, sir.  I'm sorry.  I'll submit that for the record.    


<p>     LEVIN:  No, there's no problem.  That's fine.  Just submit that  for the record. 
 

<p>     EBERHART:  Yes, sir.  Again, as an operator -- going down there,  visiting at Pratt &
Whitney, I was very impressed with what I saw.    


<p>     LEVIN:  There was a question, Admiral McGinn on concurrency on  the F-18 E&F  and even
though it is a concurrency question so let  me use this moment to ask you about that. I think that
at yesterday's hearing, Senator Warner noted that  there would 76 F-22s that would be authorized
and appropriated by  Congress when the operational testing on the F-22 is completed.  Believe
that was the figure that was used. 

<p>     Now the F-18 E&F  program, it would appear that Congress will  have authorized and
appropriated funds for 114 E&Fs  before  operational testing is completed.  Now is that not even
a greater  concurrency issue then on the E&Fs  than it would be on the F-22s  if those numbers
are correct or approximately correct? 

<p>     MCGINN:  Senator Levin I'd like to turn to my colleague Craig  Steidle who was a former
program manager for the F/A18-E/F and I think he  can give you a more informed answer on
that. 


<p>     STEIDLE:  Sir, if you don't mind, I'll answer that.  When we put  that program together it was
a non-concurrent program with  demonstrated performance at every milestone.  Before we had
approval  to go on with the first LRIP  buy, we had first flight.  But  before we were allowed to
go for the second one, we had demonstrated  250 glides  and flying of all seven test articles. 
Before we went  on for the third LRIP  we had another demonstrated performance.  So it was a
very non-concurrent program with demonstrated performance.  


<p>     The operational testing of that particular aircraft started very  early in the simulators with
enough  assessment, first of all, and  there was a long string.  The operational testing finishes
when we  have a full suite  of aircraft -- full suite  of weapons in  the inventory, but the airplane
is fielded before that with a list of  required weapons suites  that the service has provided for us. 
So  -- I'm sorry -- but it is demonstrated performance doing milestones  which continues on
throughout the process. 
 

<p>     LEVIN:  Has there been any change in those milestones during the  level of concurrency on E
and Fs? 
 

<p>     STEIDLE:  No, sir.  There hasn't.  We've been on schedule, on  performance all the way
through.  It's worked well. 
  

<p>     WARNER:  Let me go back on the 22 concurrency, you're referring  to the science board
report of April, 1995, page 35.  Do you have a  copy of that with you, General. 
 

<p>     EBERHART:  I do now, sir. 

<p>     WARNER:  Just a rough calculation, the American taxpayers are  going to have about a half
billion dollars invested in airplanes  flying during this current cycle.  That's a lot of money.  I
occurs to  me that we should have some assurance from Congress that if you in the  course of this
program discover, Jerry  our problems.  And that's  going to exacerbate the concurrency problem. 
What procedures do we  have in place for first, addressing those problems internally and  making
such adjustments to the program that may be required?  And  secondly, informing the Congress
promptly of what you intend to do?    


<p>     EBERHART:  Sir, in terms of specific procedures in place, I don't  know.  I'll have to submit
that for the record.  I can tell you when  the issues that you've talked about earlier that reference
that point  on the performance curb where we are looking at what that would cost  us to stay with
it and also when we looked at a range issue, that in  both cases, as soon as that was found out,
that came forward to Air  Force leadership, immediately went into the JROC  process and we 
were over talking to members of your committee and yourself, sir, to  discuss those with you. 


<p>     EBERHART:  I pledge to you that we've learned from other  programs, other issues, that this
bad news doesn't get better with  age; that we need to go ahead and address the issue.  And
everybody  who has a stake in the action needs to know about it and be involved  in the
corrective action. In terms of the specific process or procedures that are in place,  I'll have to go
check with the acquisition committee.  But watching  that first-hand at that time, I was the J  on
the Joint Staff and  I saw that unfold, which really gave me a good feeling about -- I  think it's
tied to the new acquisition reform process and those types  of things. 
 

<p>     WARNER:  Just reading from page 35, quote, If there are  significant delays in the
accomplishment of these key events and  they're described earlier, or if the performance levels
achieved are  unacceptable, the program could be adjusted by staying at the four  aircraft per year
production rate for an additional year. And you giving the committee the assurance that they're in
place  besieged us to make that prompt adjustment.  Is that correct?  And you  will provide for
the record? 
 

<p>     EBERHART:  Sir, I believe they're in place.  I will provide for  the record what they are.  If
they're not, I'll provide for the record  that they're not in place and then what we need to do to
satisfy that  requirement. 
  

<p>     WARNER:  And I would like just a sentence in the letter that this  matter has been reviewed
by the secretary of the Air Force.  I just  think it's very important that a matter of this seriousness,
that the  secretary give you full support which you're entitled to make that  tough decision for the
department. 

<p>     EBERHART:  Sir, I agree, and I'm sure she will. 

<p>     WARNER:  It's very important representation to the committee.  Let's proceed on to another
issue. 


<p>     LEVIN:  There's one... 


<p>     WARNER:  Yes, sure. 


<p>     LEVIN:  On that one question -- just on this issue, it's a --  we're going to need to be satisfied
on this concurrency issue.  I for  -- is not particularly satisfied with the answer that you gave to
the  chairman about whether or not this was not threat-driven or not. We are not going to take
risks, I hope, to in this program. that  are going to be driven by a threat when it seems to me we
should make  sure that we do not make mistakes in the building of this plane and I,  for one,
would rather it be done right in a year or two later than to  find that we've got to do a bunch of
fixes on this plane.  So when you were asked whether or not it was threat-driven and  then when
you told me and your answer to that was non-committal when  the chairman asked you, and then
when I asked you the question about  the level of risk and the concurrency and the same issue
that the  chairman raised, you talked about a delicate balance between getting  there as soon as
possible which was your words. 

<p>     LEVIN:  I'm a little concerned when you say as soon as  possible.  I think I would have said
it, I would have put a qualifier  before possible, like as soon as reasonably possible or with 
reasonable degree of certainty, or something in there to give us some  assurance on the
concurrency issue. But let me phrase the question this way, and you may not be able  to answer
this, General.  And if so, that's fine.  You can do it for  the record -- you don't have to worry
about that. But the science board's findings about the acceptable overlap in  the F-22 program
between testing and production depends upon requiring  that the development and the testing --
excuse me -- must pass certain  key events which are identified.  And this was what the
Chairman was  referring to. 

<p>     In the C-17 program, which was also supposed to be operating on  an event-based schedule,
the production imperative kept us signing  contracts even though the events were slipping.  Now
Admiral Steidle,  on the F-18 description, said that we must meet key events before  releasing
procurement funds.  It was a very clear answer on that  question. And I think the Chairman's
question may have been -- I may be  duplicating the Chairman's question, but if I am let me put
this in my  own words.  Is the Air Force committed to sticking to achieving  testing events as a
necessary prerequisite to signing the F-22  contract? 
 

<p>     EBERHART:  Sir, we certainly are. 
 

<p>     LEVIN:  Pardon? 


<p>     EBERHART:  We certainly are, yes.  We have to go through those  wickets, we have to
establish those goals before DABs and pre-DAB and  DRB decisions.  So we will have those
milestones before we can move  from one portion of the program to another.  And we're
committed to  that.  I think... 


<p>     LEVIN:  And our contracts provide for that?  Our existing  contracts provide for that? 

<p>     EBERHART:  Sir, I assume... 

<p>     LEVIN:  Let us know, let us know that for the record.   

<p>     EBERHART:  Again, I'll have to provide that for the record.  
 

<p>     LEVIN:  We just don't -- we want to be moving here according to  testing events having been
met, not according to a schedule which is  set forth in a contract with a contractor.  That's the
point here, and  if you can give us that assurance for the record I think that at least  helps me out
some.  Thank you. 

<p>     EBERHART:  And back to your original question.  I think your  choice of words is probably
much better than mine, but I think the  bottom line is that we are comfortable with the
concurrency.  We think  that the risk is acceptable, that we're not letting the threat drive  us to do
something stupid, something dumb.  We're comfortable with  that balance.  And we're not -- as
you said, as soon as reasonably  possible is probably a better choice of words. 

<p>     LEVIN:  My memory goes back here not just to the C-17 but to the  B-1 and B-2... Yeah,
where we --  you know, we had -- somehow or other  there was a window of vulnerability, and
we had to rush the B-1.  And  we made a mistake, made a lot of mistakes.  As a result, it didn't 
have the capabilities that we wanted it to have. Instead of saying, look, let's build the B-2 and do
it right and  take, if we have, quote, a little more vulnerability for a few more  years, my God,
we've got enough capability in that area anyway, let's  do it right. 

<p>     EBERHART:  Yes, sir. 
 

<p>     LEVIN:  Instead we, I think -- and I don't want to rehash the  whole B-1 battle -- but I think
the chairman's point is, and I would  agree, is that we really want to do the F-22 right, and we do
not want  a high-level of concurrency. And if that means we get it done a year or two years later,
so be  it. 


<p>     EBERHART:  Yes, sir.  Sir, those lessons that you referenced are  not lost on the Air Force
either, and we're very concerned about those  as we move forward. 

<p>     EBERHART:  And we're -- bottom line is we're comfortable with the  concurrency we see in
this program. 

<p>     LEVIN:  Well, you know, everybody has his own view.  In my view,  it's a very high degree
of concurrency associated with a high degree  of risk and I've always been under the impression
that the threat that  was driving this not in a stupid area, but just we were at the outer  edge of the
envelope, as you say, you fly on the area of risk and  concurrency. And that was driven by the
surface-to-air threat.  And I seem to  have gained that from General Fogleman's testimony
because it's --  this program is very, very expensive.  It's consuming ever larger  amount of the
overall budget -- not only Department of the Air Force,  of the across-the-board tac air program,
and that likewise concerns  me. 

<p>     WARNER:  Let's go to Admiral and the JAST -- have you had a  chance to look at the Time's
article? 

<p>     STEIDLE:  Yes, sir. 


<p>     WARNER:  And are there areas in which you feel that you would  like to put information,
comments... 

<p>     STEIDLE:  Yes, sir, I would. 


<p>     WARNER:  ...otherwise in the record?  Fine. 

<p>     STEIDLE:  Yes, sir, I would. 

<p>     WARNER:  Because it's an important piece, and I want to make sure  that our record reflects
any thoughts you have. 
 

<p>     STEIDLE:  Yes, sir.  I think Mr. Shannon  did an outstanding  job on the article in total, sir. 

<p>     WARNER:  Did he interview you, by any chance? 

<p>     STEIDLE:  Yes, sir, he did. 

<p>     WARNER:  Well, that's why it's outstanding then. 
 

<p>     STEIDLE:  Yes, sir.  There was one area that he linked...    


<p>     WARNER:  Why don't you teach us politicians how you...    


<p>     STEIDLE:  Yes, sir.  He had linked me to the $750 billion  estimate that he had, and I, in fact,
went back to him after the  session that we had and said, I cannot add my numbers up to get to 
that particular figure. Mr. Blackwell  from Lockheed mentioned a trillion dollar  program and a
Wall Street analyst recommended a $750 billion.  They  are probably -- they have more
experience in this particular field  than I have, but 3,000 airplanes at $30 million a copy comes
out to  $90 billion, and this is an order of magnitude above that.  So I told  him I had difficulty
with that particular figure. Another area was -- in the article here, I just noticed and I'm  sorry I
didn't the first time I read this -- airplanes will roll out  in 2005.  That's true of the test articles. 
The first operational  airplane will be available in 2008. And the third piece that he brings in is
the fact that --  alluding to the fact that perhaps the Navy would possibly in the  future not
support the program as strongly as the other services.  I  think -- I disagree with that. Admiral
Boorda has told me several times that he fully supports  this and needs the aircraft, and the Navy
is fully behind it.  Other than that, sir, I think it's on target. 


<p>     WARNER:  All right.  Let's address then the funding profile --  $131 million in fiscal '96. 
That was -- excuse me -- that was a cut  of $131 million off a baseline of what figure? 


<p>     STEIDLE:  Approximately $331, sir.  It brought us down to about  $200 million in '96. 
 

<p>     WARNER:  Those figures -- you're going to stick with them? 

<p>     STEIDLE:  I'm going to refine them in just a second, sir.    


<p>     WARNER:  All right. 

<p>     STEIDLE:  I'll give you the exact figures there within plus or  minus two or three million, sir. 

<p>     WARNER:  You know, while he's getting to the figures, I have to  recount when I used to
testify as Secretary of the Navy, we would  literally have two dolly carts full of records behind
us.  And now I  guess with the modern computer and brighter officers, we're able to to  it with a
handful of papers. 
  

<p>     STEIDLE:  Or submit a lot for the record. Sir, the exact figures... 


<p>     WARNER:  All right. 

<p>     STEIDLE:  I'm sorry, we started out with $345 million and went to  $206 million. 


<p>     WARNER:  Before -- OK, tell us what was the impact of that cut,  then.  Those are some
fairly hefty bucks. 


<p>     STEIDLE:  Yes, sir.  If I could just step back for just a second  from where the program
started.  It started in the Bottoms-Up Review  in '93.  At that particular time, the AFX program
and the multi-roller  fighter airplane were cancelled, were rolled into one in this  particular
program. 

<p>     Mr. Deutch in August of that year established a program with a  memorandum and laid in a
wedge at that particular time in '93 for the  program.  Since that particular time, we've merged the
A-STOVL  program into it.  We've gone from a technology demonstration to an  actual strike
fighter program and the wedge stayed in the same shape.  And that's not appropriate for a
DEM-VAL or development program.  You  need up front funds and the shape of the curve
should be a bell-curve  skewed to the left. 


<p>     I went forward in August and July of last year with redefining  the program as we put some
more substance on it.  Went forward and  then came on over here to several of the staffs in late
August or  September time frame, after it had gone past your particular committee  with this new
funding profile.  I presented a profile that was going  to use '96 funding to be able to do work in
'97.  That funding was  quickly removed and the statement was put in that that funding should  be
applied in '97.  That was two year money.  We could do that.    


<p>    The services came forward with a program decision memorandum in  September fully funding
the program to the new DEM-VAL profile that  we're executing today. So, in answer to your
question, sir, the bottom line is we  reshaped the program and we have the money in the right
year and the  funding profile was correct to execute. 
 

<p>     WARNER:  What time sequence was it adjusted? 


<p>     STEIDLE:  We moved the program four months to the right.  I  looked at some tech
maturation programs that we're doing.  We moved  those in the out years.  We looked for
redundancies and shelved a few  of those particular programs.  Moved the end point out four
months.  And the total program was then reshaped and moved to the right  slightly. 
 

<p>     WARNER:  I may return to that program, but I'll have a question  for Admiral McGinn and
then refer to my colleague.  The old EA-6B --  what a workhorse. 

<p>     MCGINN:  Yes, sir. 

<p>     WARNER:  I think the taxpayers got their money's worth out of  that plane, wouldn't you
say? 

<p>     MCGINN:  They continue to get it Senator. 

<p>     WARNER:  No question about it.  The committee has waited for some  time for the
completed studies of Airborne Electronic Warfare  Requirements.  Despite DOD's
unresponsiveness, last year's Defense  authorization bill included generous funding for the
electronic  warfare upgrades and modifications.  The committee's concerned that  delays in
making substantial upgrades EA-6B will prevent the Navy from  capitalizing on prior investing
in the advance capability, that's the  ADV cap.  Is the Navy now ready to move out on this
program and make  it a substantial commitment to near term EW capability? 

<p>     STEIDLE:  Yes, sir, we are.  We continued to wisely use the funds  that Congress provided
last year, the $165 million.  We spent 100  million of that dollars -- or we are spending 100
million of that  dollars in upgrading 20 aircraft to the block 89, the more modern  block 89
configuration.  We spent an additional $40 million to get  what we call band nine and ten
electronic warfare transmitter pods.  And the final $25 million is going for 30 pods for
communications  jamming. 

<p>     In addition to that, we have R&D programs that are ongoing to  address the idea of a reactive
jamming capability, something that you  can use against a variety of threats.  With the
proliferation of First  World weapons systems throughout many, many different areas of  interest
to the United States, we are concerned that we don't get so  stabilized and solidified in a
particular threat system that we can't  react agilely through additional threat systems that could be
put  together with money by a nation with interests counter to ours.  So  the reactive jamming is
one answer to help us to be able to fly with  confidence into an enemy air defense system in any
uncertain future.    


<p>     WARNER:  I'm going to ask General Magnus a question on JAST.  And  mister recorder, can
you put the general's response following Rear  Admiral Steidle's JAST comments so we've got
that one placed in the  record. 

<p>     General, is your invitation letter -- that is in our invitation  -- we asked you about the Marine
Corps view of JAST program.  How  would you describe the relevance of that program to the
future of the  Marine Corps aviation? 

<p>     MAGNUS:  Mr. Chairman, I'm glad that you asked me that question  because I had the
opportunity this morning to speak to the commandant,  General Krulak, exactly on that topic. 

<p>     WARNER:  This morning? 

<p>     MAGNUS:  This morning, sir. 

<p>     WARNER:  You guys got off to a good, early start over there,  didn't you? 

<p>     MAGNUS:  Yes, sir.  As I've said, sir, readiness is your Corps.    The Marine Corps has made
the commitment in a real sense...    


<p>     WARNER:  You got a little sleep along the way, though, I served  in the Marines for many
years without any sleep, and I assure you that it helps. 

<p>     MAGNUS:  The Marine Corps has made the commitment in a very real  way to accept
near-term risk in our strike fire community, our AV-8B  Harriers and our F/A-18s.  We're putting
our, literally our  investment, our money where our mouth is, and the technology leap that  we
see is in the joint strike fighter program. 

<p>     We believe that we and the nation, our wingmen in the Air Force  as well as our shipmates in
the Navy, urgently need the joint strike  fighter, and we believe from our perspective in the Corps
that now is  the time to take the incremental degree of risk, we think, with the  forces that we
have, looking at the threats that are in the next  decade, to take that leap to 2008 to the joint strike
fighter.    

<p>   WARNER:  OK, so you're still on board. 

<p>     MAGNUS:  Yes, sir.  We're in the lead as far as our IOC  requirements, and we joined,
welded at the hip with the Air Force and  the Navy in the urgent need for this affordable,
survivable family of  over 2800 joint aircraft. 

<p>     WARNER:  Thank you.  Senator Levin. 

<p>     LEVIN:  Just one question on the JAST program.  Admiral Steidle,  the press has reported
recently there's some problems with the release  of proprietary information to competing
contractors by the JAST  office.  Can you describe what has happened and whether this is a 
significant problem? 

<p>     STEIDLE:  Yes, sir.  Well, there was, indeed, proprietary  information.  There was an
inadvertent disclosure, unfortunately, at  the fax machine.  An enclosure to one particular letter
was put into  two other letters that went out to the competing contractors.    


<p>     So therefore certain pricing and costing information from one  contractor went to the other
two.  The two particular contractors saw  that immediately, wrapped it up.  I sent my security
officer out there  after it.  We have statements to that effect, and we are providing  information to
the contractor whose information was sent. I hope to have it completely resolved by Wednesday
and the  release of our RFP on Thursday of next week. 

<p>     WARNER:  Would you yield to me? 


<p>     LEVIN:  Sure. 

<p>     WARNER:  I -- at an appropriate time, if you're going to continue  with JAST. 

<p>     LEVIN:  No, I'm done with JAST. 

<p>     WARNER:  I think, Admiral Steidle, you should -- even those this  is a purple program that
you're operating -- what's the Navy's  perspective on JAST meeting its requirements in the out
year --  operational requirements? 

<p>     STEIDLE:  Sir, could I have Admiral McGinn that, sir?    


<p>     MCGINN:  Just as General Magnus stated, we are firmly onboard  with the JAST program,
Senator.  Our need in terms of timing isn't as  urgent as the Marine Corps in the 2007, 2008
timeframe. But we have a road map to the future that involves going from  where we are today
with the types of aircraft and our air wings, using  the significant increase in capability of the
F-18EF and then blending  that in a complementary way with JAST when it comes onboard
Navy  aircraft carriers in about the 2010 to 2012 timeframe -- about three  to four years after the
Marine Corps. 

<p>     WARNER:  General Eberhart, for the Department of the Air Force...   

<p>     EBERHART:  Yes, sir. 

<p>     WARNER:  Is it likewise your... 

<p>     EBERHART:  Yes, sir.  It would sound like a recording.  We're  completely behind it, and we
are.  It's key to the Air Force of the  future. 

<p>     WARNER:  And in all, then, this joint program is working out  well?  As a matter of fact, I
think your deputy, Admiral Steidle, is a  BG selectee? 

<p>     STEIDLE:  Yes, sir, he is.  Yes, sir, the Air Force's newest  general, sir. 

<p>     WARNER:  Good.  That's fine. 


<p>     STEIDLE:  If he doesn't mess up JAST. 


<p>     WARNER:  So we don't know whether you're really a general for  about 10, 15 more years
then? Only thing I can tell you, colonel, general or whatever the case  may be -- I knew General
Eberhart when he was a major.  So somehow  he's made it, despite his association with members
of Congress.  All right.  Excuse me, thank you.  Colleague, I'd like to get  that one JAST thing in
the record altogether. 

<p>     LEVIN:  Well, the follow-up on that JAST question would be you  say that the competitor
whose proprietary information was  inadvertently disclosed has now been informed of that? 


<p>     STEIDLE:  He has been informed, sir.  And I will go down on  Wednesday of next week and
present our investigation to them.  That  particular contractor issued a agency protest -- rightfully
so, in my  mind. 

<p>     STEIDLE:  I will present all the information to him, and tell him  what our investigation in
impact of the disclosure of that material  has. 

<p>     LEVIN:  So, we really don't know yet what the effect is going to  be.  It's not been resolved
yet? 

<p>     STEIDLE:  No, sir, it is not.  No, sir, it is not.  By Wednesday  I'll have it finished. 

<p>     LEVIN:  If you'd let us know the outcome of that for the record,  it would be helpful. 

<p>     STEIDLE:  Wilco.  Yes, sir. 

<p>     WARNER:  Just as a follow-on, Senator.  Your program has recently  progressed from
concept exploration into the requirements generation  and validation process.  What will be the
critical two or three events  between now and the award of the EMD to produce test aircraft? 
What  has to go right, what could go wrong? 

<p>     STEIDLE:  Yes, sir.  We're starting... 

<p>     WARNER:  Great staff question. 

<p>     STEIDLE:  Yes, sir. 

<p>     STEIDLE:  We're doing business differently, Senator.  We  have this group of
cost/performance trades.  It's never been done  at that level before. Industry is a full partner of
this.  We  are trading off the requirements base that each one of the  services have allowed us a
large envelope to work in as we pull  it down. 

<p>     Moving into the development phase, we'll award the two contracts  to the two teams.  They
will have to demonstrate their ability to  build this airplane with a high level of commonality,
which  significantly reduces the cost, demonstrate hover in transition,  demonstrate carrier
suitable flying quality, and continue on with the  ground demonstration of technology
maturation.  We need to mature the  technologies before we go into the EMD program.  That'll be
done.    


<p>     And our ORD will be completely finished by the year '99.  And  that's a process in itself that
is being done in the virtual world in  modeling and simulation.  So it's a significant change from
the way we  have done business in the past. 
 

<p>     LEVIN:  Let me get to the data link issue on the fighter  aircraft, general.  Apparently, getting
tactical data links into the  fighters has been a difficult issue for the Air Force for a number of 
years.  Some have the perception that the Air Force has resisted  adding that capability, not just
because of cost but because of  cultural barriers.  I'm convinced that the added situational aware 
that sharing the data among various platforms would provide has  tremendous potential for us. 

<p>     Are there fighter data links included in the com-links that the  chief of staff has added to his
list, do you know? 


<p>     EBERHART:  Yes, sir, there are. 

<p>     LEVIN:  And is the... 

<p>     EBERHART:  It's under the guise of sensor shooter, and under  that... 

<p>     LEVIN:  Would you just say that again? 

<p>     EBERHART:  It's under the title sensor to shooter, and under that  are the things that you're so
concerned of and so are we.  And you're  spot on, it was a cultural problem for a while, and in my
view we  might have hid behind the money issue.  We're committed now, we  realize how
important it is to joint war fighting, and we're moving  ahead. 

<p>     LEVIN:  All right.  And General Magnus, is the Marines committed  to also adopt that
capability? 

<p>     MAGNUS:  Senator, we are.  We, of course, field our aircraft in a  common long-range plan
with the United States Navy and a program that  is unique to us, having taken over the Advanced
Technical Air  Reconnaissance System.   For example, we have added a data link pod to  that
system so that when it is fielded it will not only give us the  capability to download the
reconnaissance when we get to the ground,  but will be able to give near real time bursts of that
critical  tactical battlefield information to joint force commanders and forces  at sea. 
 

<p>     LEVIN:  OK.  Admiral McGinn do you want to add anything to that?    


<p>     MCGINN:  Yes, sir.  We are already flying in many of our aircraft  including the F-14 D, the
J-TDS, or LINK-16, which we have found  provides tremendously increased situational
awareness and it allows  aircraft in a particular strike package or fighter sweep to coordinate 
their efforts in a much better way than we've ever been able to do  before. 

<p>     I'd like to also say that a Marine program that offers a great  deal of promise that has been
fielded and prototyped is a  digitalization called Automatic Target Hand-Off System which
allows a  Marine on the ground under fire to digitally communicate right into  the aircraft
weapons system, in this case the AV-8B, but it will --  we're looking to field it in all of our
FA-18s as well.  You know,  actually put the symbol of the target that the Marine Lance Corporal 
in the trenches wants to hit, needs to hit, right on the heads-up  display of the fighter aircraft or
the AV-8B.  And it is a tremendous  leap forward in close air support capability for the future. 
And  General Magnus might want to comment further on that, sir.    


<p>     MAGNUS:  And I appreciate the comments of my shipmate, Admiral  McGinn, the
Automatic Target Hand-Off System because exactly right,  our forward observers, forward air
controllers on the ground will be  able to take the standard 9 line immediate air support request
and  beam it up via data link just as the Admiral said, so the pilot in a  strike aircraft that is line
of sight, but out of visual range will be  able to stand off from the threat, receive the information
and roll in  on the target. Coupling that capability with the emerging 1760 BUS digital  capability
in weapons like JDAM and JSOW, we are literally going to be  able to deliver close air support
to troops on the ground at night  through the weather in the future with precision, accuracy,
because of  the capability to pass that information up and then load it down into  the weapons. 

<p>     LEVIN:  Are we funding that program as much as we -- in a robust  way, we, in this budget? 

<p>     MCGINN:  I'd love to get an answer for you for the record Senator  on that. 

<p>     LEVIN:  And General, I take it from your answer that the Air  Force is now committed to
having the same kind of reliance on the  tactical data links in it's fighter aircraft as we've just
heard  described by the Navy and the Marines. 

<p>     EBERHART:  Yes, sir, to put a little more bluntly but you  referenced it earlier.  We're over
our cultural problem that we had.  And then to take it one step further, exactly what they just 
discussed, this interface between the digitalization of the ground  battle and the air battle is key. 
In the past when we did look at it,  we looked at it more of just digitalization of the air, and data
link  in the air.  And working that together is how we really become  efficient.  And then, oh, by
the way, reduce fratricide. 

<p>     LEVIN:  Well, it's good news to hear your testimony this morning,  and the budget numbers
will be helpful if you'll submit those.  

<p>     EBERHART:  Yes, sir. 

<p>     LEVIN:  Because that -- that's an area of top priority for this  committee and has been for a
number of years. 

<p>     WARNER:  General Magnus, would you please pass on to your senior  chief of aviation our
best wishes for a speedy recovery from his  operation and so forth? 

<p>     MAGNUS:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  General Blot is recovering  well.  He has had
shoulder surgery, for your information.  And the  reason why he's not here is obviously he's fairly
uncomfortable --  doing very well but couldn't get into his uniform.  So he sent me to  speak to
you this morning. 


<p>     WARNER:  Glad to have you. Let's talk about your CV-22 and the problems that have been 
expressed by the retiring chief of the U.S. special operations  command.  What do you have to
enlighten us on that?  Have you read that article?  If not, I'll send it up so  you can skim it for a
minute. 

<p>     MAGNUS:  I'm not sure which article to which you're referring --  although there have been
several that I've read in the last few days. 
 

<p>     WARNER:  Well, let's work off the the same baseline, and I'll go  to another question. 

<p>     MAGNUS:  Mr. Chairman, I am familiar with this article.    


<p>     WARNER:  Well, why don't you go ahead then? 

<p>     MAGNUS:  The joint V-22 program, I believe, is a success story,  and of course like many
other large programs that are in engineering  and manufacturing development we're constantly
challenged by  constrained fiscal resources. 

<p>     When the Department of Defense had a defense acquisition board  and a defense resources
board in 1994 joining the U.S. Air Force  Special Operations Command requirement for a special
operations force  CV-22 to the Marine Corps MV-22, the estimate for the development of  the
CV-22 -- the U.S. Special Operations Command variant -- was $550  million. 

<p>     And that estimate came from the United States Air Force, I  believe it was Aeronautical
Systems Command.  Subsequent to that, the  Department of the Navy committed, with
Department of the Navy RDT&E  money, to fund that $550 million profile that we believed
would be  adequate to provide to take the MV-22 baseline aircraft into a Special  Operations
variant. 
 

<p>     In the succeeding two years, Special Operations Command has  defined its configuration
much more finely than they had in '94.  We  -- the program office and Naval Air Systems
Command submitted a  request for a proposal for the development effort to the Bell-Boeing  joint
team. 

<p>     And essentially, the response from the contractors came in at  approximately $200 million
over what was allocated in the budget.  Clearly, that presented more than a minor challenge
because we did not  have, in the Department of the Navy, that additional $200 million.    


<p>     And something had to move, and we certainly recognized the  Special Operations Command
requirements as well as their need for a  fiscal year 2005 IOC. 

<p>     There have been a number of meetings between the Assistant  Secretary of the Navy for
Research and Development, Mr. Douglas, and  the U.S. Special Operations Command
representatives on alternatives in  which we believe there are more than one alternative and
which within  the Navy's commitment to the $550 million we can -- with ideas such as 
preplanned product improvement -- provide exactly the kind of aircraft  that Special Operations
Command and our Air Force wing men need to be  able to accomplish their critical mission. 


<p>     MAGNUS:  There are ongoing discussions between Special Operations  Command and the
United States Navy.  OSD has been involved in the  overarching team that is watching this
program closely.  And we have  been, of course, in consultation with our Air Force wingmen.
We believe there are more than one solution that will allow us to  execute to our $550 million
commitment and provide the Air Force  Special Operations Command the aircraft that they need
when they need  it. 


<p>     WARNER:  That's reassuring and Douglas is a very able man,  trained here by this
commission, and I have a high degree of  confidence, as do other members. 

<p>     Do you want to take a question or I'll... 

<p>     LEVIN:  Just on the V-22 issue.  There have been some, another  press report relating to
testing results on the V-22 which indicates  some problems, unacceptable level of down draft or
prop wash below the  aircraft operating, when it operates at hover.  Is there going to be  an
opportunity during the operational testing to determine whether or  not that condition is real. 

<p>     MAGNUS:  Senator, thank you very much for that question.  We have  been aware -- and I
say we in a personal sense -- have been aware of  the down wash effect of tilt rotors, not only
from our experience with  high velocity down wash aircraft such as V-stal , but when I was a 
major I was on the joint NASA-Army-Navy-Air Force and Industry team  that went out to NASA
Ames and modeled the aircraft that was then  being designed call JVX, which has since become
the V-22 Osprey tilt  rotor. 

<p>     We were well aware that the velocity and the footprint, if you  will, of the air that is moving
down was going to be more than we have  in the current medium helicopters, but, quite frankly,
comparable to  heavy lift helicopters, such as the CH-53 Echo; different, but  comparable to it. 

<p>     In other words, that we knew that people who were operating in  the vicinity underneath the
aircraft would have a high velocity down  wash.  And we anticipated this, so this is not a
surprise. As a result of that, during our operational tests we have just  completed operation test
2B, which focused specifically on this issue.  We better understand how ground combat marines,
sailors and soldiers  will operate under aircraft that are being flown by Air Force, Navy  and
Marine Corps pilots, and we believe, and I have personally read  the comments of marine
helicopter support team members, lance  corporals who have worked under these aircraft, who
basically say it  is comparable to their CH-53 Echo experience. 

<p>     What I can tell you is, just like the CH-53 Echo, which went  through it op eval in 1979, and
there were words in the report there  that described it as dangerous and requiring special
equipment that we  didn't have in 1979, we will find tactics, techniques and procedures  that will
allow us to safely and effectively utilize this aircraft.  We have anticipated this problem and we
are working with our  joint wingmen on this as well as the people who will actually be the  real
customers of the aircraft, and that's the troops that'll be in  the back.  I'm confident that this will
be resolved. 

<p>     LEVIN:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 

<p>     WARNER:  This is a question to all three.  We'll ask General  Eberhart, Admiral McGinn and
General Magnus to answer. 
  

<p>     WARNER:  Over the years, the committee has taken an active  interest in airborne.  Part of
this has been addressed, but the  senator and I want to make sure that there is nothing left in this 
untouched. The committee has taken an active interest in airborne electronic  warfare.  An
initiative by the committee a few years ago was  encouraged by the Defense Department to
consolidate airborne EW into  one program and to adequately fund that program. Today we have
an aged EA-6B fleet which -- with much the same  capability as in the years past, while the threat
expands and becomes  more sophisticated.  At the same time, the Air Force plans to retire 
EF-111. What is the importance of airborne electronic warfare to your  tactical aviation program? 
What near-term capabilities do you have to  address that threat, General, to the extent you haven't
covered it  already? 

<p>     EBERHART:  Yes, sir.  Obviously, airborne ECM is very important  to our program and the
survival of our pilots and our effectiveness on  the battlefield. 

<p>     We support the efforts that are ongoing to build the EA-6B fleet  up, make improvements to
it, to provide for our joint ECM  requirements.  We're part of the solution there, and not part of
the  problem.  We're committed to it. 
 

<p>     However, at the same time, I have to tell you that we have an  insurance policy there in that as
we draw down the EF-111s, we keep  them around till the -- the number's classified -- but
sometime in  '98.  We can an increased crew-to-aircraft ratio, and the airplanes  that we do retire
we don't take the date as moth them, we leave on  the ramp. 

<p>     So if there is a hiccough or we have a requirement, then we can  fall back on it.  But we're
committed to it.  We want it to work.  We  know it's the right thing to do. 

<p>     You know, and the committee knows as well as I do, that we have  to approach this problem
from many different ways.  In addition to  airborne ECM, if we have better battlespace awareness
in terms of  increased intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance so we know  where the
threats are, we know what the threats can do, we know how to  either attack them or avoid them,
using Stealth and using PGM.    


<p>     We also have the nonlethal part of this, and eventually some day  we think there will be
information warfare ways to get in and help us  survive in the battlefield of the future.  And we
think it's important  to work all of these aspects, and that's what we're committed to.    


<p>     WARNER:  Admiral McGinn? 
  

<p>     MCGINN:  I fully concur with General Eberhart's remarks, Senator,  and I'd like to just add a
few of my own.  The EA-6B is, as mature an  airframe and engine combination as
 it is, still enjoys a great deal of  service life that is available to it. 

<p>     We have an active and ongoing operational safety improvement  program that is closely
monitored by engineers and air crewmen and  maintenance personnel in the field as well as at the
various systems  commands. It is a truly joint program in that later this month, the three  service
chiefs will sign a memorandum of agreement that will solidify  the progress that we have made
in making the EA-6B fleet truly the  nation's tactical EW force. I received a report from the wing
commander -- the EA-6B wing  commander -- two weeks ago as well as one of the EA-6B
squadron COs  who had just returned from deployment over in the Mediterranean.  They  are
absolutely confident that the program is on track. It is properly resourced in terms of airframes,
the equipment  upgrades that are going in now and are planned, as well as the air  crew upgrades
as well. We have Air Force air crews flying in EA-6Bs in training as well  as in operations, and
they have also coordinated at the EA-6B wing  level with all of the services and all of the unified
commanders in  chiefs and their staffs to make sure that the global coverage exists  in terms of
forward presence as well as a very responsive reaction  capability should that be required in any
type of a regional  contingency. 

<p>     WARNER:  General. 
  

<p>     MAGNUS:  Mr. Chairman, I agree with the remarks of General  Eberhart and Admiral
McGinn.  The Marine Corps, as you know, has four  squadrons of prowlers in the ICAP-2
configuration.  We along with the  Navy are operating our aircraft to the Block-89 Alpha
configuration.    


<p>     As I told you earlier in the hearing, Marines are on the ground  today in Aviano and earlier
last year when there was the need to bring  additional tactical aircraft into the theaters to support
strikes that  were needed on the ground, Marine squadrons deployed within 48 hours  and was
flying combat missions on the third day from the time that  they got the to order from the Joint
Chiefs of Staffs. 
 

<p>     We were integrated with the Navy in carrier deployments as well  as basing out of our base at
Iwakuni, Japan.  We will support the  United States Navy in fulfilling our important
responsibilities in the  Department of the Navy to provide aircraft not only for our own  support
requirements but to support the United Sates Air Force and our  allies. 
  

<p>     Of course, the United States Navy has received a budgetary FYSYP  up and some structure to
take up the Air Force's EF-111 mission as  those aircraft stand down.  Nevertheless, and
consistent with the  tactical aviation integration memorandum of agreement that the 
Commandant of the Marine Corps and the Chief of Naval Operations have  in general about all
of our strike and electronic warfare aircraft, we  will support the United States Navy in fulfilling
our commitments to  the nation. 

<p>     WARNER:  Senator Levin.  Gentlemen, I'm going to  have to absent  myself and my
distinguished colleague will wrap up the hearing.  Thank  you very much. 

<p>     LEVIN:  General, I want to talk to you about F-16s for a minute.  We've got a new definition
of service life of the F-16s which is now  driving us to purchase some additional F-16s.  And
there's a real  question about whether that's the right way to go given our other  needs in the Air
Force.  But let me try to work through this number  with you.   We have a 20 wing fighter force
now and I gather the  portion of that force that is made of F-16s is somewhat more than  half.  Do
you know off hand if that's correct? 

<p>     EBERHART:  Sir, that sounds correct.  I'll get the number here as  you... 

<p>     LEVIN:  OK, well, than maybe I better get these numbers for the  record. 

<p>     EBERHART:  Yes, sir. 

<p>     LEVIN:  Let me tell you what I need, because you may not have  them at your fingertips. 
What I need to know is what was the F-16  requirement when we had a 26-wing force, what was
the F-16 requirement  now, what would it have been had we gone to a 36-wing force, which was 
the goal during the early '90s? 
<p>     Those three items I need and how many F-16s would have made up  those three different
force structures.  Then I need you to translate  that into both the old definition and the new
definition of service  life in terms of how many available F-16s we got.  And that's  something
you can provide us for the record. 

<p>     EBERHART:  Yes, sir. 


<p>     LEVIN:  Do you know in general whether or not the number of F-16  fighter wing
equivalence has changed over the recent past?  Do you  know that offhand? 
<p>     EBERHART:  Sir, it is changed, obviously, as we've drawn down  some F-16s, and we can
think of wings like the 474th at Nellis and  other wings that have drawn down.  And as airplanes
have aged, it's  certainly changed, although the other fighter force structure is  changed, too. 

<p>     So I don't have on the tip of my tongue what the relationship in  terms of proportion of force
is in terms of change, but we'd like to  show that to you for the record and the proportion of the
different  blocks, how they've changed... 


<p>     LEVIN:  All right. 

<p>     EBERHART:  ...because that's what complicates this issue, as you  know. 

<p>     LEVIN:  Right.  That's fine.  Are you familiar with the Coalition  Force Enhancement
Program?  Does that strike a bell? 

<p>     EBERHART:  I think I...no, sir. 

<p>     LEVIN:  OK.  This was a program that would have given the F-16s  some improved
capability, upgraded them, added some service life.  And  we can find that in a different way. 

<p>     EBERHART:  Yes, sir, I am familiar with that program.    


<p>     LEVIN:  OK.  Was it our plan to use that program and sell those  upgraded F-16 to our allies? 


<p>     EBERHART:  Sir, our hope was to do just that and then have a  device or a procedure where
that money is supposed to be returned to  the Treasury would be returned to the United States Air
Force to buy  these attrition reserve airplanes that we've just discussed.    


<p>     LEVIN:  Do you know the cost of adding 4000 hours of service life  to a plane under that
program? 

<p>     EBERHART:  No, sir, I do not know.  One of our big problems right  now is that as we've
looked around on this and how much we would have  to sell those for, I think the brutal facts are
there are no buyers.    


<p>     LEVIN:  They want to... 

<p>     EBERHART:  Just as soon have a new airplane. 

<p>     LEVIN:  All right.  Now, are you familiar with the JSTARS budget  request in the current
budget? 

<p>     EBERHART:  Yes, sir. 


<p>     LEVIN:  As I understand it, the budget would cut the JSTARS  procurement in half during
fiscal years '99, 2000, and 2001, buying  one instead of two during those fiscal years? 

<p>     EBERHART:  Sir, my recollection was that we did, in fact, move  one airplane right.  I wasn't
aware that we moved three right.  I  thought we moved one right.  I'll have to provide that for the
record.    


<p>     LEVIN:  Can you tell us what the experience with the J-STARS was  in the Persian Gulf War,
in Bosnia? 

<p>     LEVIN:  Are the CINCs interested in more JSTARS? 

<p>     EBERHART:  Sir, the CINCs are very interested in the JSTARS  program as it exists today
and the planned improvements as we get on  through the production line. 

<p>     Obviously, as you know, the bird that we have today and the  production birds will be much
more capable than the bird that we had  in the Persian Gulf.  And that -- we were all amazed by
what it was  able to do in such short notice. 

<p>     I think that in Bosnia today, people are impressed with what it's  doing, although it's a
different situation because of the topography,  we don't have a pool table, if you will, like we had
in Desert Storm  or like we imagined in the central region of Europe. 

<p>     But we have tools where we can go and take this and show the CINC  that if you bring
JSTARS here and you put it in this orbit, this is  what you're going to be able to see around
Sarajevo.  This is what  you're not going to be able to see.  So that the expectations are  there and
he fully understands what this tool will bring to him as a  CINC. And that's exactly what we did
before we deployed JSTARS, so it's  living up to the expectations, and it's allowing us to use it in
ways  in peacekeeping and peace making that we hadn't envisioned using in a  major regional
contingency. So everybody's very impressed with what they see in terms of  JSTARS now.  And
frankly, the move right was an affordability issue to  make sure that everything would fit. 


<p>     LEVIN:  Well, that's what troubles me is that we've got a new  technology and a new
platform, which is working extremely well from  everything we can learn, and we're moving that
to the right for  affordability reasons. 

<p>     And then, we're spending money buying F-16s and F-15s for  attrition reserves, which are
only created by the changing the program  life expectancy of planes.  And where planes could be
upgrades quite  easily, as a matter of fact, if necessary in order to extend that  program life. 

<p>     I mean, it just seems to me there's a disconnect here where we've  got a real need of a new
technology that is proving itself every day  in Bosnia and has proven itself in -- over many, many
months in the  Persian Gulf, and that we're delaying and using money to create a  reserve which
really, it seems to me, is not a realistic need when you  consider the fact that we've reduced the
number quite dramatically of  how many F-16s we're going to need because of the reduction in
fighter  wings. 

<p>     So, to me, it's a priority which is misplaced, but I'm not asking  you to agree or disagree with
that so much as I need from you for the  record the history of the F-16s when we had 26 fighter
wings.  Now  that it's down to 20 what would have been had we -- the requirement --  what the
requirement would have been had we gone up to 35?  The impact on the -- on that requirement
when we changed the  service life expectancy of the F-16 and then we can put all that  together
and reach our own conclusion.  But at least that's certainly  my tentative conclusion. 

<p>     EBERHART:  Sir, we'll certainly provide that and the chief shares  your concerns there. 
Maybe not necessarily versus the F-16 but the  importance of that JSTARS and we are relooking
that now as we build  the '98 to '03 program. 

<p>     LEVIN:  OK.  Thank you.  And then my last question, General  Magnus, has to do with the
C130-J aircraft, and I understand that  you'd like to begin buying a tanker version of that aircraft.
Is that  correct? 

<p>     MAGNUS:  Senator, our current active force has 37 35 year old  KC130-Fs and an additional
14 slightly younger KC130-Rs.  Based upon  what our projection of the service life of those
aircraft are,  unfortunately the bulk of them are going to come due for block service  life
retirement just exactly when we need to invest in aircraft like  the joint strike fighter and V-22
and the Navy's F/A-18EF.  We have been monitoring the United States Air Forces C130-J 
program.  We are enormously impressed with the improvements in the  cockpits and the avionics
in the performance of the air craft.  We  believe it would be prudent for us to be able to
essentially piggy  back on that program.  Fiscal resource constraints have not enabled us  to do
that at this time. 

<p>     LEVIN:  Now you just completed, did you not, the modernization of  your tactical tankers a
couple of years ago? 

<p>     MAGNUS:  That's correct.  We still have some other things that  are being modernized in
terms of radios, global position, satellite  com.  So, there is a continuing strain, but essentially
that is  correct. 

<p>     LEVIN:  And despite that recent completion of that modernization  program, you want to start
buying some new tankers for reasons that  you gave? 

<p>     MAGNUS:  Well, essentially the modernization that we're talking  about, that the Senator is
referring to, is sub-systems.  Our concern  is service life, fatigue life of the aircraft.  These
aircraft are 35  years old.  We would have to spend an enormous amount more money to 
basically do a service life extension on these aircraft when we have  aircraft that are being
produced for the United States Air Force.  They're going to have very low ownership costs, just
as ours are  spiking. 

<p>     So, we believe it prudent not to invest in schlepping old  aircraft when in fact they're going to
be very cost effective in terms  of life cycle costs and commonality.  Very cost effective --
C130-Js  being produced for our wing men in the United States Air Force. So we look forward to
being able to take advantage of that  program. 


<p>     LEVIN:  Thank you all.  Appreciate your testimony.   We will  stand adjourned.
