								<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">To avoid repeating the mistakes of early adopters, if an innovation has already been field tested by other schools, a wise team devotes considerable time and attention to considering what others have learned. This learning requires considerable tact and skill because many early adopters may promote the innovation without sharing stories of frustration and disappointment.</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">The trick is to find innovators who can be trusted to share the trials and the tribulations as well as the triumphs.

								<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">How is this program supposed to work?</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Packaged programs imported from outside a school district rarely succeed unless customized to match local conditions and special needs.</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">The process of deconstructing a program is a bit like taking apart a lawn mower or automobile engine back in the days when there were few electronic parts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By disassembling the motor or program into its parts, program managers may consider modifications and adjustments.</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">A district might identify a successful writing program that employs Inspiration&#153; and wireless laptops, for example, to teach students writing as process within the guidelines and expectations of state standards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon close examination and deconstruction, the district team determines that the program needs bolstering at the idea generating and the editing phases.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Because the district has already invested heavily in an approach to editing and revision called &quot;The Six Traits Approach to Writing,&quot; the team protects that investment by adding it as a major program component.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They then go in search of idea generation strategies to enhance the model.</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">In many cases, innovations proceed to installation as if such tinkering and adjustment is unnecessary and burdensome, but a failure to modify a program may undermine past efforts like the one mentioned above and may also limit the potential of the new program to shift daily practice.</font></p>

								<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Homegrown innovations may stand a reasonable chance of taking root, especially if the district nurtures the development of human resources devoted to the invention process.<span style="mso-spacerun:

								<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Metaphors drawn from the world of gardening may provide illuminating insights for those planning innovations.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>If we are doing our jobs well, we will be raising seedlings in hothouses, testing them, clearing areas, weeding, cultivating the soil, fertilizing, planting, weeding, pruning, thinning and weeding some more.</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">We are careful to plant where conditions are right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, some school planners leave out some of the most important steps in the planning (or gardening) process, installing a network without cultivating the soil - without investing in program development or professional development.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>They may plant desktop units where there is little willingness to use them, the equivalent of planting sun hungry plants in heavily shaded areas.</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Most of these missteps occur because these planners do not view the change process as organic. They focus on wires, cables and equipment. They neglect the human and organizational elements that are basic to a thriving and robust effort.</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">But invention is not enough by itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Unless informed and guided by astute data collection to assess which aspects are proving effective, the innovation can turn into a new suit of clothes for whatever emperors are shopping.</font></p>

								<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">When it comes to networking schools and classrooms or adopting new technologies, some leaders tend to rush things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Just as folk wisdom argues that &quot;Haste makes waste,&quot; research on change in schools warns against riding change mobiles through avalanche territory (Fullan, 1991).</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Even though the shortest distance is usually a straight line, most road and railway</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:0in"><font face="Arial">builders know better than to head straight up a mountain without providing plenty of curves.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They rely on switchbacks to keep the angle of ascent reasonable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They know engines have their limits.</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">Schools should follow this example. They should make the strategic pacing of change a priority if they hope to see a real (and beneficial) shift in classroom practice.</font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">See &quot;Pacing Change,&quot; an article that originally appeared in the September 2000 issue of <b>Classroom Connect.</b> <a href="http://fno.org/nov00/pacing.html">http://fno.org/nov00/pacing.html</a></font></p>
								<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial">There are many advantages to delay when it comes to new technologies. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>School districts that come to the game late may find that slow and discerning decision making means they leapfrogged over some of the silly and misguided efforts of their neighbors.</font></p>
