          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Dear Mr Prime Minister,</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">This is the most painful letter I 
            have ever written. Painful because the middle finger of my left hand 
            is fractured. Broken on December 26 by Konoike security guards near 
            the Sondu-Miriu Hydropower Project in Nyanza, Kenya. This fracture 
            was made worse by Kenya police who tortured me. It was then aggravated 
            by fellow hardcore inmates who beat me on orders from the police.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">My left shoulder aches. The outcome 
            of a bullet graze that was aimed for my head by Kenya police on the 
            same date. It was meant to be fatal, I was told by police commander 
            Kola of Ahero police station.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">He told me: “My orders were to shoot 
            you dead. I would have been charged with murder. Then I would have 
            spent seven years in prison. I was going to come out definitely. But 
            when do you think you would have come out of your grave?” </font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">What am I talking about? Perhaps I 
            have put the proverbial cart before the horse. I introduce myself. 
            </font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">My name is Argwings Odera. I am the 
            person co-ordinating the human rights campaign in Nyanza and efforts 
            to save the Sondu-Miriu river from the overwhelming negative impacts 
            of a 80 MW hydropower project initiated in 1999. This is a project 
            funded by the Japanese government. Over 200,000 people are affected 
            negatively.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">This is the third time I am being 
            arrested because of our activities at the project. We were first arrested 
            and detained for two days sometimes in November 1999. Then we were 
            arrested again, with about 20 others, on February 28, 2000, detained 
            for a day at Ahero police station and released without charge.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">What did I do this time round? Mine 
            was a case of shoot the messenger before he delivers the news. My 
            colleagues and I had held a meeting on December 19 with the country 
            representative of JBIC in his Nairobi offices. We outlined the problems 
            of Sondu-Miriu. The representative listened to us for two hours. Then 
            he spoke for thirty minutes.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Among the things he said was that 
            we go to Sondu and inform the affected community of an impending meeting 
            with top Japanese officials. We told him of our fears. He guaranteed 
            that he would end the harassment in the project area and protect us 
            from further arrests.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Thus it was with joy that I set out 
            December 26 to be the bidder of good news to members of the community. 
            I did not have any foreboding as I drove from Nairobi for 500 kilometres 
            to the project area. </font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">At around midday, I was snaking up 
            the dusty road towards a nearby shopping centre called Apoko. I offered 
            a lift to three villagers who were walking up the hilly and windy 
            15 kilometres to the shopping centre. </font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">At the centre, one of them informedf 
            he was going acrossd the river, another four kilometres, over the 
            bridge built by Konoike. This bridge, according to project documents, 
            was meant to benefit members of the local community who did not have 
            to spend any more money on the ferry operators.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">I was stopped at the bridge by security 
            guards who told me I was unwanted in that area and that our project 
            vehicle had been banned from using the road. I left the villager to 
            walk across the bridge. I turned the vehicle and was flagged down 
            by another villager who requested I take him to the shopping district. 
            I obliged. </font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">The time was 12.30 pm, December 26. 
            As I drove back towards the shopping district, about a kilometre from 
            the bridge, a big green gravel mixing truck came thundering towards 
            me. On my left was deep depression. We drive keeping left. On my right 
            was a mountain wall. The vehicle was steered directly towards me. 
            I steered right. The left side of my car was hit, the side mirror 
            cluttered into the deep ravine. There was dust all over.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Another vehicle, a van, came behind 
            me and blocked my path.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Two Konoike security guards emerged 
            from the haze. They were waving their walkie-talkies menacingly. I 
            identify one as Charles O. Ogutu and another as Mike Gundo. I can 
            identify the rest by sight. All I could hear them say was: “You are 
            the inciters. Today you will see fire …”</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">That was before I spat out blood when 
            the guards punched me, secifically Ogutu, in the mouth. The villager 
            was shocked. He was yanked out of the car, beaten and kicked into 
            the depression. I only saw his white shirt disappearing beneath me 
            as he rolled over and over. It was at that moment that I locked myself 
            in the car and rolled up the windows. The Konoike guards stoned the 
            car in a bid to break in. They only stopped when they saw villagers 
            appearing over the hills with machetes. They radioed for reinforcement.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">At 1.30 pm, five armed policemen appeared 
            with a vehicle. I was still sandwiched between the two cars. The police 
            leader ordered me to open the doors of the vehicle. Instead, I opened 
            a small section of the window. I heard Ogutu urge him to shoot me 
            dead in the car.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">“Shoot him … shoot him. Kill him. 
            He has stopped our money from coming. Kill him!” That is all I remember 
            hearing.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">I told the policemen to let me know 
            if I was under arrest and to show me the arrest warrant. I told him 
            I was afraid to open the window further because the Konoike guards 
            had just broken my finger, and I did not want them to break another 
            finger. The policeman stepped back and talked over his walkie-talkie. 
            Four policemen had surrounded the vehicle with their guns cocked.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">I was dehydrating fast because I was 
            confined in the car under the sweltering tropical heat.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">At 3.30 pm, more policemen, all armed 
            came. The number I counted rose to about 30. The number of villagers 
            was also swelling as word spread across the villages about what was 
            happening to me.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">One policeman identified himself as 
            Kola, the Ahero police commander. He ordered me to open the doors 
            to the vehicle. I asked him if I was under arrest. He said he just 
            wanted to have a word with me. I told him we could speak through the 
            small crack because my finger had been broken and I was afraid the 
            Konoike guards, who were hovering around, would break the other fingers.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">He got angry and declared I was under 
            arrest. He ordered me to open the door of the vehicle. I told I would 
            gladly follow the policemen to the station but no armed policeman 
            would be allowed to enter inside the vehicle as per office regulations.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">I remember him saying: “Who do you 
            think you are? You think you are gold? I will call a towing vehicle 
            at your own expense!”</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">The number of armed policemen, machine 
            guns, rifles and pistols, had swelled to about 50. The number of villagers 
            had also increased to more than 500 people.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">At 6.45 pm the angry villagers started 
            throwing stones towards the policemen who fled the scene. I was later 
            told the recovery vehicle had just come and was preparing to tow my 
            vehicle. I could not see it because I was sandwiched between the two 
            big vehicles. Apparently the villagers had vowed that the police would 
            not take me anywhere.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">At 7.15, darkness crept. I am told 
            the villagers were afraid the police would use the cover of darkness 
            to harm me. The villagers lit three pressure lanterns which illuminated 
            the area very well. They settled for a night-long vigil.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">At around 8.30 pm, I heard movement 
            on the left side of my car. Then I heard instructions being given. 
            I heard something like “Fire in the car … if it gets him, too bad! 
            Fire three shots that side and you fire twa … twa … twa the other 
            side.”</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Horrified, I opened the passenger 
            side window to tell the police not to shoot at the villagers because 
            I surrender. The next thing I saw was a black figure with an AK-47 
            aimed at me. Everything else happened in slow motion. </font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">I could see myself laughing and telling 
            myself I was not meant to die this way. Meanwhile, I started dropping 
            down. The floor of the car was so far way. And there was a lot of 
            heat on the left side of my body. </font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">My eyes were clogged with glass. My 
            nose was bleeding, also clogged with glass. There was strong smell 
            of metal, I guess gunpowder. I could see my head rushing towards one 
            of the Konoike vehicles that had blocked my path, the door opened.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">I could see fire flies all over. Except 
            this time the flames were ugly. They were red and</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Sparking instead of the beautiful 
            light yellow. I remember assuring myself that the villagers would 
            be safe. But I was having difficulty breathing because I had been 
            kicked into the floor of the Konoike van which was still carrying 
            Mr Ogutu, the Konoike security man. The vehicle was being driven too 
            fast and somebody kept punching my ribs from the back.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">The police later said they had fired 
            over 100 bullets which I was to pay for.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">The Konoike vehicle was stopped 15 
            kilometres from the site of my arrest. Ogutu said he had to kick in 
            two of my teeth. The policemen escorting me pleaded with him not to 
            do that because their boss knew the condition I was in when I was 
            arrested and they would lose their jobs if I arrived in a different 
            condition. He was promised there will be enough room to beat me when 
            we reached the Ahero police station.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">I lost track of time at that moment.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">I was kicked into the police station 
            from the van. There I was received with blows and kicks by a Mr Otieno, 
            the district criminal investigation officer. I was immune to pain 
            at that time. I could not see. My hearing was bad. I heard him say 
            I was going to die from my bullet wound. That is when I realisedf 
            my T-shirt was glued on the left side of my body. It was wet and cold. 
            But I could not see, rolling my eyeballs would cause a great deal 
            of pain.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">I was stripped naked and taken to 
            a room where I was told the police would plant a letter on me that 
            I was planning to bomb the construction site. Otieno and other policemen 
            asked me if I was ready to confess that I was the Sondu bomber. I 
            sad no. I was lashed but felt no pain because my whole body was throbbing.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">That is when they noticed my broken 
            finger. Somebody grabbed the finger and twisted it demanding I confess. 
            Now there was real pain. I screamed. The police said as a journalist, 
            I will never type again. Somebody punched my wounded shoulder. I screamed 
            again. Somebody ordered I stop screaming and start singing a popular 
            local song titled Malo! Malo! (Higher! Higher!). I knew the song that 
            night. I sang with every stab of pain on my shoulder or finger. I 
            wished they could just go on kicking me and punching me and leave 
            the shoulder and finger alone.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">I heard Ogutu saying my future was 
            ruined because he was going back with a group of police officers to 
            shoot at the men and rape their women. Their blood would be in my 
            hands.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">I think at around 1 am, I was thrown 
            in jail. The inmates had been ordered to beat me up because I was 
            bringing trouble to the government. I landed into more fists and clawing 
            hands the moment I was thrown in jail. It was at that moment the inmates 
            noticed my dislocated and broken finger. Afraid they had broken the 
            finger, five of them pinned me down as one yanked the digit back into 
            place. I screamed. A dirty rag was shoved in my mouth to muffle the 
            scream. </font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Then they noticed my eyeful of glassses. 
            I was pinned down again and another licked the eyeballs, spitting 
            in the sloth bucket all the time. Because I did not want the rag shoved 
            in my mouth, I screamed inwardly.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">I am nursing horrible thrashes and 
            wounds on the lips.</font></p>

          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">But I was glad for what they did. 
            They then peeled off my shirt to inspect the bullet wound. One of 
            them produced a colgate toothpaste which was smeared over the wound 
            so that it dries over the wound.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Then they demanded to be told what 
            I had done.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">The next day, I was ordered to empty 
            the full sloth bucket. Naked, bare feet, I walked into a filthy toilet, 
            now half blind, where I emptied the sloth bucket. Later in the day, 
            I was summoned from the cell block. I was informed I was going to 
            sing again.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">I sang amid pain and torture. This 
            time I saw Otieno, the investigating officer, making orders for my 
            beating. Suddenly, all the police stopped beating me and saluted. 
            At the door was a senior intelligence officer ? the people who report 
            directly to State House and the president. I was taken to another 
            room where this man, he is kind, interrogated me for four hours. He 
            did not beat me. He asked such questions like preferred sex position.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">This is also the day the beating officially 
            stopped. The station commander, Kola, however kept on reminding me 
            that he was yet to give me 10 strokes of the cane. My request to be 
            seen by a doctor were turned down. My request for my clothes were 
            turned down. I was only given my jeans trouser.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Came December 28 and we were close 
            to 100 people in the cell. Water was brought in a bucket to wipe the 
            floor. The hardcore inmates used it to bath before assigning people 
            duty to wipe the floor of the lice infested jail.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Came the 29<sup>th</sup> and I was 
            in the privileged circle. I was allowed to bath with the dirty water 
            and wipe myself with soap. Other prisoners merely looked on enviously.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">This was the same day I was removed 
            from Ahero in a hide and seek game between the police and my lawyer. 
            I was moved 30 kilometeres away to the Kisumu jail, kept incomunicado 
            before being transferred 50 kilometres away to Maseno.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Again I was denied the opportunity 
            to see a doctor, to bath or to sit in the sun. I spent 30<sup>th</sup>, 
            31<sup>st</sup> and January 1, 2000 with nobody knowing my whereabouts. 
            I was not tortured at Maseno. I would just drift into sleep, back 
            into wakefulness and back into sleep. I lost a lot of weight for lack 
            of water.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">It was then on December 2, that I 
            was produced in court, injured, wounded and beaten, charged with resisting 
            arrest, incitement to violence, tresspass and taking photographs and 
            publishing false information to Japan.</font></p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> 
          <p align="JUSTIFY"> </p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">What lesson did I learn from all this 
            punishment as I painfully reflect on what happened to me? That the 
            will of the people of Sondu-Miriu shall prevail!</font></p>
