<H2><A name="firewall.standalone">Firewalling a standalone system</A></H2>
<P>Firewall rules on a standalone system doing IPsec can be very simple.</P>
<P>The first step is to allow IPsec packets (IKE on UDP port 500 plus
 ESP, protocol 50) in and out of your gateway. A script to set up
 iptables(8) rules for this is:</P>
<PRE># edit this line to match the interface you use as default route
# ppp0 is correct for many modem, DSL or cable connections
# but perhaps not for you
world=ppp0
#
# allow IPsec
#
# IKE negotiations
iptables -A INPUT  -p udp -i $world --sport 500 --dport 500 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp -o $world --sport 500 --dport 500 -j ACCEPT
# ESP encryption and authentication
iptables -A INPUT  -p 50 -i $world -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -p 50 -o $world -j ACCEPT</PRE>
<P>Optionally, you could restrict this, allowing these packets only to
 and from a list of known gateways.</P>
<P>A second firewalling step -- access controls built into the IPsec
 protocols -- is automatically applied:</P>
<DL>
<DT><A href="glossary.html#Pluto">Pluto</A> -- the FreeS/WAN keying
 daemon -- deals with the IKE packets.</DT>
<DD>Pluto authenticates its partners during the IKE negotiation, and
 drops negotiation if authentication fails.</DD>
<DT><A href="glossary.html#KLIPS">KLIPS</A> -- the FreeS/WAN kernel
 component -- handles the ESP packets.</DT>
<DD>
<DL>
<DT>KLIPS drops outgoing packets</DT>
<DD>if they are routed to IPsec, but no tunnel has been negotiated for
 them</DD>
<DT>KLIPS drops incoming unencrypted packets</DT>
<DD>if source and destination addresses match a tunnel; the packets
 should have been encrypted</DD>
<DT>KLIPS drops incoming encrypted packets</DT>
<DD>if source and destination address do not match the negotiated
 parameters of the tunnel that delivers them</DD>
<DD>if packet-level authentication fails</DD>
</DL>
</DD>
</DL>
<P>These errors are logged. See our<A href="trouble.html">
 troubleshooting</A> document for details.</P>
<P>As an optional third step, you may wish to filter packets emerging
 from your opportunistic tunnels. These packets arrive on an interface
 such as<VAR> ipsec0</VAR>, rather than<VAR> eth0</VAR>,<VAR> ppp0</VAR>
 or whatever. For example, in an iptables(8) rule set, you would use:</P>
<DL>
<DT><VAR>-i ipsec+</VAR></DT>
<DD>to specify packets arriving on any ipsec device</DD>
<DT><VAR>-o ipsec+</VAR></DT>
<DD>to specify packets leaving via any ipsec device</DD>
</DL>
<P>In this way, you can apply whatever additional filtering you like to
 these packets.</P>
<P>The packets emerging on<VAR> ipsec0</VAR> are likely to be things
 that a client application on your machine requested: web pages, e-mail,
 file transfers and so on. However, any time you initiate an
 opportunistic connection, you open a two-way connection to another
 machine (or network). It is conceivable that a Bad Guy there could take
 advantage of your link.</P>
<P>For more information, read the next section.</P>
<H2><A name="incoming.opp.firewall">Firewalling incoming opportunistic
 connections</A></H2>
<P>The basic firewalling for IPsec does not change when you support
 incoming connections as well as connections you initiate. You must
 still allow IKE (UDP port 500) and ESP (protocol 50) packets to and
 from your machine, as in the rules given<A href="#firewall.standalone">
 above</A>.</P>
<P>However, there is an additional security concern when you allow
 incoming opportunistic connections. Incoming opportunistic packets
 enter your machine via an IPSec tunnel. That is, they all appear as ESP
 (protocol 50) packets, concealing whatever port and protocol
 characteristics the packet within the tunnel has. Contained in the
 tunnel as they pass through<VAR> ppp0</VAR> or<VAR> eth0</VAR>, these
 packets can bypass your usual firewall rules on these interfaces.</P>
<P>Consequently, you will want to firewall your<VAR> ipsec</VAR>
 interfaces the way you would any publicly accessible interface.</P>
<P>A simple way to do this is to create one iptables(8) table with all
 your filtering rules for incoming packets, and apply the entire table
 to all public interfaces, including<VAR> ipsec</VAR> interfaces.</P>
<H2><A name="opp.gate.firewall">Firewalling for opportunistic gateways</A>
</H2>
<P>On a gateway, the IPsec-related firewall rules applied for input and
 output on the Internet side are exactly as shown<A HREF="#firewall.standalone">
 above</A>. A gateway exchanges exactly the same things -- UDP 500
 packets and IPsec packets -- with other gateways that a standalone
 system does, so it can use exactly the same firewall rules as a
 standalone system would.</P>
<P>However, on a gateway there are additional things to do:</P>
<UL>
<LI>you have other interfaces and need rules for them</LI>
<LI>packets emerging from ipsec processing must be correctly forwarded</LI>
</UL>
<P>You need additional rules to handle these things. For example, adding
 some rules to the set shown above we get:</P>
<PRE># edit this line to match the interface you use as default route
# ppp0 is correct for many modem, DSL or cable connections
# but perhaps not for you
world=ppp0
#
# edit these lines to describe your internal subnet and interface
localnet=42.42.42.0/24
internal=eth1
#
# allow IPsec
#
# IKE negotiations
iptables -A INPUT  -p udp -i $world --sport 500 --dport 500 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp -o $world --sport 500 --dport 500 -j ACCEPT
# ESP encryption and authentication
iptables -A INPUT  -p 50 -i $world -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -p 50 -o $world -j ACCEPT
#
# packet forwarding for an IPsec gateway
# simplest possible rules
$ forward everything, with no attempt to filter
#
# handle packets emerging from IPsec
# ipsec+ means any of ipsec0, ipsec1, ...
iptables -A FORWARD -d $localnet -i ipsec+ -j ACCEPT
# simple rule for outbound packets
# let local net send anything
# IPsec will encrypt some of it
iptables -A FORWARD -s $localnet -i $internal -j ACCEPT </PRE>
<P>On a production gateway, you would no doubt need tighter rules than
 the above.</P>
