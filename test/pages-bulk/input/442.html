        Civil Relief Act (Public Law 108-189). This means that servicemembers
        domiciled outside of California, and their spouses, may exclude the

        in California remain unchanged. Military servicemembers domiciled in
        California must include their military pay in total income. In addition,
        they must include their military pay in California source income when
        stationed in California. However, military pay is not California source
