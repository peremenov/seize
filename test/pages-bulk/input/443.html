    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
    <p align="left">Good afternoon. I am delighted to be here, and I am honored to be back at
    the FTC as its Chairman. </p>
    <p>As many of you may know, this is my third tour at the FTC. I first served as Assistant
    to the Director of the Office of Policy Planning and Evaluation in the mid 1970s. I
    returned in 1981 to serve as the Director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection, and then
    became Director of the Bureau of Competition in 1983. I am fully committed to the
    institution and its mission of protecting consumers through actively enforcing our
    antitrust and consumer protection laws. I return as Chairman with great anticipation of
    the challenges and excitement that lie ahead.</p>
    <p>There has been considerable speculation about possible changes at the Commission. Some
    predicted that there would be substantial continuity from the previous administration,
    with changes mainly at the margins. Others agreed that there would be continuity but
    hedged their bets - they were uncertain how wide the margins might be. Others predicted -
    perhaps wishfully - that changes would be more dramatic. For example, they anticipated
    substantially reduced merger enforcement. I expect the last group will be disappointed. A
    vigorous enforcement program is necessary to fulfill the agency's mission to protect
    consumers. The first group has it right. Continuity will be the norm, with changes at the
    margins. </p>
    <p>We have assembled a first-rate staff. In the operating Bureaus, we have: Howard Beales,
    Director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection; Bill Kovacic, General Counsel; David
    Scheffman, Director of the Bureau of Economics; and Joe Simons, Director of the Bureau of
    Competition. All have extensive experience in their fields; each has substantial prior
    experience at the FTC; and each has extensive post-FTC experience related to the agency's
    mission. Joining this group are Anna Davis, Director of Congressional Relations, who also
    previously worked at the FTC, Rosemarie Straight, who remains as Executive Director, and
    two newcomers: Ted Cruz, who is our new Director of Policy Planning, and Cathy MacFarlane,
    who will head our Office of Public Affairs. I appointed these individuals because of their
    superb qualifications and, like me, they are committed to the FTC and its mission. </p>
    <p>Today, I will sketch a vision of the landscape ahead. Along the way, I will retrace the
    origins of some of the policies that I expect to follow. You will see that continuity
    should not come as a surprise. There is much ground to cover, and I will touch on each
    topic only briefly. You will hear more about each of these subjects in the coming months. </p>
    <p>Before continuing, I should repeat the standard disclaimer that my remarks today are my
    own, and not necessarily those of the Commission or of any other Commissioner.</p>
    <p align="center"><strong>I. Why Should We Expect Continuity?</strong> </p>
    <p>Antitrust has become an area of bipartisan cooperation. Although there are
    disagreements about specific cases, there is widespread agreement that the purpose of
    antitrust is to protect consumers, that economic analysis should guide case selection, and
    that horizontal cases, both mergers and agreements among competitors, are the mainstays of
    antitrust. Moreover, today there is bipartisan recognition that antitrust law is a way of
    helping to organize our economy. A freely functioning market, subject to the rules of
    antitrust, provides maximum benefits to consumers. </p>
    <p>Bob Pitofsky's tenure as FTC Chairman was in that vein of bipartisanship. In fact, he
    and his appointees praised the leadership of his predecessor, Janet Steiger, who was
    appointed by the first President Bush. Bob was clearly one of the most effective Chairmen
    in the history of the Commission.<a HREF="#N_1_"><sup>(1)</sup></a> Of course, Bob brought
    his intellect, scholarship, and management skills to the job. But a key reason for Bob's
    success as Chairman was that his agenda and enforcement policies reflected the bipartisan
    consensus. Those policies were not significantly different from those of his predecessor
    in the previous administration. There were changes at the margins, and, as would any new
    chairman, Bob faced some new challenges. That is my message today - there will be some
    changes at the margins, but mainly there will be continuity. There will not be a sea
    change in enforcement.</p>
    <p>Bob Pitofsky set a high standard, and he should be applauded for his efforts on behalf
    of consumers. He and I may differ on certain points, but I, too, intend to characterize my
    tenure by what I do, rather than what I do not do. Let me turn to some specific areas of
    antitrust. </p>
    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><strong>II. Merger Enforcement</strong></p>
    <p>This year is the 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the passage of the Hart-Scott-Rodino
    Act.<a HREF="#N_2_"><sup>(2)</sup></a> </p>
    <p>The passage of HSR and the resulting evolution of merger enforcement policy has
    undoubtedly been the most important statutory development in antitrust for several
    decades. Like antitrust enforcement generally, merger enforcement is about protecting
    consumers from unwarranted exercise of market power. As the Chairman of the FTC, I take
    that mandate very seriously. I do not see significant change in basic merger enforcement
    from the Pitofsky Commission. We will apply the Merger Guidelines<a HREF="#N_3_"><sup>(3)</sup></a>
    to the available facts, as did the Pitofsky Commission. Problematic mergers will face the
    same hurdles they did during the 1990s. </p>
    <p><strong>A. Evolution of Merger Policy in the 1970s and Early 1980s</strong></p>
    <p>Let me add some historical perspective on why continuity is appropriate. By the time of
    the <em>General Dynamics</em> decision in 1974,<a HREF="#N_4_"><sup>(4)</sup></a> it was
    clear that merger policy would have to change to reflect new realities. Cases like <em>Von's</em>
    were relics of the past.<a HREF="#N_5_"><sup>(5)</sup></a> Economic research debunked the
    fears of market concentration at even low levels.<a HREF="#N_6_"><sup>(6)</sup></a> Rigid
    reliance on concentration statistics and structural presumptions would no longer suffice;
    we would have to look at the competitive dynamics of the market. There was growing
    awareness that we live in a global economy - market boundaries don't necessarily end at
    the U.S. border. And there was a growing realization that efficiencies are important.</p>
    <p>Those changes were reflected in 1982 Merger Guidelines,<a HREF="#N_7_"><sup>(7)</sup></a>
    promulgated during Bill Baxter's regime at the Antitrust Division. The new Guidelines were
    a milestone in antitrust. They incorporated an economically sound analytical structure
    that was workable in practice and provided clear guideposts for businesses and antitrust
    practitioners. </p>
    <p>The 1982 Guidelines laid the foundation for today's merger enforcement. Although
    improved over the years, the core analytical structure remains the same. The Guidelines
    have stood the test of time and have become even more influential. The courts increasingly
    follow them, and they have greatly influenced merger enforcement across the world. Bill
    Baxter is, unfortunately, no longer with us, but his legacy lives on. His Guidelines were
    applied by Bob Pitofsky's Commission, and I expect to do the same.</p>
    <p>In fact, I was one of the early implementers of the 1982 Guidelines' analytical
    structure. We were an active, even proactive Commission back then. I became Director of
    the Bureau of Competition in 1983, and during my 2½ years in that position, we dealt with
    matters such as:<ul>
      <li><em>Texaco-Getty</em><a HREF="#N_8_"><sup>(8)</sup></a> and <em>SoCal-Gulf</em><a
        HREF="#N_9_"><sup>(9)</sup></a> - two transactions that, <em>at that time</em>, were
        considered large oil mergers; </li>
      <li>One of the first consumer branded products mergers analyzed under the Guidelines;<a
        HREF="#N_10_"><sup>(10)</sup></a></li>
      <li>One of the first instances of &quot;competing mergers&quot; - two mergers in the<em>
        carbon black</em> industry;<a HREF="#N_11_"><sup>(11)</sup></a></li>
      <li><em>Warner-Polygram</em>, a large merger in the entertainment industry;<a HREF="#N_12_"><sup>(12)</sup></a>
      </li>
      <li>The <em>GM-Toyota</em> joint venture in California;<a HREF="#N_13_"><sup>(13)</sup></a> </li>
      <li><em>Pilkington Brothers,</em> a flat glass merger that involved a non-domestic company.<a
        HREF="#N_14_"><sup>(14)</sup></a></li>
      <li><em>Allied Corp.,</em> a merger involving avionics for general aviation aircraft.<a
        HREF="#N_15_"><sup>(15)</sup></a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>These were important cases, and their influence is present today. Our analysis of the <em>Texaco/Getty</em>
    and <em>SoCal/Gulf</em> transactions, and the 1982 FTC Oil Merger Report,<a HREF="#N_16_"><sup>(16)</sup></a>
    laid out most of the basics of how the FTC has analyzed much larger oil mergers over the
    past decade. The consumer products merger investigation was one of the first to use
    statistical methodologies to analyze substitutability of branded products. That analysis
    by our Bureau of Economics stimulated further research and paved the way for today's major
    cottage industry of economists doing econometric analyses of consumer demand for branded
    products. </p>
    <p><em>Warner-Polygram </em>presented very complex issues in analyzing coordinated
    interaction in a dynamic industry that thrives by constantly developing new,
    differentiated products. Both <em>Warner-Polygram</em> and the two <em>carbon black</em>
    mergers were successfully challenged in court. The <em>Warner-Polygram</em> decision has
    been very influential in the Commission's ability to obtain preliminary injunctions under
    Section 13(b) of the FTC Act.</p>
    <p>Finally, the Commission's lengthy, very extensive investigation of the GM-Toyota joint
    venture was important, both for the U.S. automobile industry and American consumers, and
    in guiding later thinking about joint ventures. Our examination of the potential
    efficiencies of the joint venture was controversial at the time. Today, however, there are
    few who would argue with allowing the venture to proceed. </p>
    <p><strong>B. The Importance of Facts</strong></p>
    <p>Those of you who were involved with mergers in those early days following the 1982
    Guidelines know that we all had a lot to learn. This was particularly true of the
    Guidelines' new approach to market definition. We also quickly learned that merger
    analysis under this new regime was incredibly <strong><em>fact intensive</em></strong>. </p>
    <p>John Adams, one of the Founding Fathers of this country, once discussed facts in a
    manner directly relevant for us today. In 1770, Adams defended the British officer and
    soldiers accused of murder in the Boston Massacre. He said: </p>
    <p><strong>Facts are stubborn things</strong>; and whatever may be our wishes, our
    inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they cannot alter the state of facts and
    evidence.<a HREF="#N_17_"><sup>(17)</sup></a> </p>
    <p>Stubborn facts are what changed antitrust law and enforcement after the 1970s. For
    example, a 1983 Washington Post editorial on the GM-Toyota joint venture stated: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>[T]he rules of antitrust law as they had developed [in the 1960s and 1970s] were
      undermined by observation of how the world works.<a HREF="#N_18_"><sup>(18)</sup></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>We learned long ago that <em>facts are stubborn things</em> in merger enforcement. No
    economic theory or story-based advocacy about a merger will give you a reliable answer
    unless the facts firmly support it. This is absolutely as it should be. This is why no
    change in Administration or change in faces in the agencies will significantly change
    merger enforcement. Just as we have the burden of proving that a merger likely will be
    anticompetitive, you will need to demonstrate with sound, stubborn fact-based analyses the
    claims that you make. </p>
    <p><strong>C. Maintaining the Basic Approach</strong></p>
    <p>By saying that there will be continuity, I do not mean to suggest that I agreed with
    every specific enforcement action of the Pitofsky Commission; I did not. Overwhelmingly,
    however, when the parties pushed the Commission into court, the Commission won. So, how
    stubborn do your facts have to be? I agree with the approach of the Pitofsky Commission.
    If a merger appears problematic, the facts on your side have to be stubborn enough to
    convince a federal judge that we cannot obtain a preliminary injunction. </p>
    <p>I know that some in the press and the Bar think that the Bush administration will relax
    antitrust enforcement. I urge them, and you, to watch what we do. I can tell you
    unequivocally that if you come in with transactions that would not fly in the past, you
    are likely to &quot;crash&quot;unless you have compelling, stubborn facts on your side. To
    some of you, let me say it more bluntly. A few members of the merger bar have been telling
    the press that we are going to have more relaxed standards. Those folks will be doing
    their actual or potential clients a big disservice if those clients act on that
    presumption. If you are an experienced merger attorney, you know a problematic merger when
    you see it.</p>
    <p><strong>D. Attention to Competitive Effects Theories</strong></p>
    <p>Staying the course does not mean that we will stop thinking about the theories we
    apply. Theories of anticompetitive effects have evolved over time, and will continue to do
    so. For example, although we have always had what could be called &quot;unilateral
    effects&quot; theories, they have evolved, and they have been more widely applied since
    the 1992 revision of the Guidelines.<a HREF="#N_19_"><sup>(19)</sup></a> Some question
    whether the agency has gone too far in applying unilateral effects theories. One argument
    is that we may be in danger of returning to antitrust that focused on the elimination of
    competition between the parties to the merger, rather than competition at the market
    level. I would not go that far. It is too early to tell whether theory has outstripped
    reality. I do agree that we should be sure that we have the facts to apply a unilateral
    effects theory.</p>
    <p>The analysis of unilateral effects often relies substantially on econometric analysis
    of scanner data. We need to understand better the potential limitations of the data.
    Although the analysis is highly complex, the theories underlying merger simulation models
    are based on simple and restrictive assumptions. These can be useful tools, but we are
    looking at them more closely to understand better their strengths and limitations. </p>
    <p>Coordinated interaction theories have also evolved. In recent years there has been more
    focus on theories of coordinated interaction involving alleged price discrimination. This
    is an area in which facts are particularly important. We all understand that price <em>differences</em>,
    themselves, are not evidence of price discrimination. Price discrimination requires, among
    other things, &quot;systematic&quot; pricing policies that result in evidence of <em>actual</em>
    transaction prices that is consistent with a theory of price discrimination. </p>
    <p><strong>E. Areas Where Enforcement Policy is Still Evolving</strong></p>
    <p>Although the basics of merger enforcement are firmly in place, there are important
    substantive areas that are still evolving: &quot;high tech&quot;mergers involving
    significant innovation issues; efficiencies; and remedies. <dl>
      <dd><em><strong>High Tech Mergers</strong></em></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Merger analysis in &quot;high tech&quot; industries is not fundamentally different than
    in other industries. The basic Guidelines analysis can be applied. We should proceed,
    however, cognizant of our lesser experience in high tech industries. Moreover, the high
    tech arena, by its nature, is constantly changing. New high tech industries, often with
    new technical issues, continue to be born and to change. </p>
    <p>One aspect of high tech may warrant especially close scrutiny. The fierce competition
    for success in these industries often results in the &quot;winner&quot; enjoying a
    (perhaps short-lived) monopoly. We should be especially reluctant to allow those firms to
    merge with actual (or potential) competitors. This was part of the basis for my criticism
    of the Clinton Antitrust Division's failure to challenge the Microsoft-Web TV merger.<a
    HREF="#N_20_"><sup>(20)</sup></a> </p>
    <p>Given the relative newness of applying the Guidelines to high tech industries, we
    should assess the effects of our enforcement actions, as well as monitor the outcomes when
    we decide not to intervene. We will look for opportunities to use the Bureau of Economics
    in these retrospective examinations to help inform future decisions. <dl>
      <dd><em><strong>Efficiencies</strong></em></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>The agencies have come far in recognizing the significance of merger efficiencies. In
    1980, I wrote an article arguing that the agencies should recognize the relevance of
    merger efficiency claims.<a HREF="#N_21_"><sup>(21)</sup></a> Today, there is no question
    that they are relevant, as the 1992 Horizontal Merger Guidelines reflected. The 1997
    revision of the Efficiencies section of the Guidelines further improved the analytical
    treatment of efficiencies. And a growing number of courts now recognize the relevance of
    efficiency claims. </p>
    <p>Despite this progress, the treatment of efficiencies in merger enforcement has room for
    further improvement. I have argued that the agencies should recognize additional classes
    of efficiencies, and that their argument in court is still much too hostile.<a
    HREF="#N_22_"><sup>(22)</sup></a> The analysis will continue to evolve based on facts and
    study. These are changes at the margin, however. From my experience in the 1980s and as a
    consultant, few cases will turn solely on the efficiency issue. The bedrock principle of
    merger enforcement remains the same - protect consumers. In efficiencies, as in any other
    analysis, the facts are crucial. Efficiency claims that are not firmly based in stubborn
    facts will be given no weight.<dl>
      <dd><em><strong>Remedies</strong></em></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>The Commission's recent posture on merger remedies is controversial within the bar.
    Merger remedies, like other aspects of antitrust, have evolved during the last 20 years.
    During much of the 1980s, the agency resolved cases relatively less frequently with
    settlements. When we did settle, however, we insisted on strong structural relief. Our
    lengthy review and negotiations for remedies in the Texaco-Getty matter in 1984 led some
    lawyers for Texaco to suggest that we were a distraction from their goals. That view of
    our role is misinformed. An effective remedy is a fundamental part of merger enforcement.
    Now, as then, we must protect consumers, not help you get your deal through at consumers'
    expense.</p>
    <p>One of the techniques the Commission has recently used is an up-front buyer of divested
    assets. Much of the criticism in the Bar has been that the process of identifying and
    vetting an up-front buyer slows down the settlement process. A countervailing
    consideration is that an up-front buyer can provide added assurance that a settlement will
    work as planned. It may be particularly useful when proposed divestiture involves an asset
    package that constitutes less than an ongoing business, whose viability is somewhat
    uncertain, or assets that may deteriorate over time. There is thus an appropriate use for
    up-front buyers on occasion. </p>
    <p>An up-front buyer is not an end in itself, of course. Our principal goal is to protect
    consumers. We will require a divestiture that will likely create a viable <strong><em>business
    entity</em></strong> (rather than a creation of lawyers) to resolve the competitive
    problems posed by the merger. We may be confident before identifying one specific buyer
    that acceptable candidates exist. As with so much else of modern merger analysis, the
    issue is highly fact specific.</p>
    <p><strong>F. The Merger Review Process</strong></p>
    <p>As I noted earlier, this year marks the 25<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the
    Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. A lot has changed. When I became Director of the Bureau of
    Competition in 1983, the merger review process under HSR was still evolving; we were still
    on the learning curve. Today, we have a well-functioning program in place - not perfect,
    as all of you will agree, but it does a remarkable job. We have a smaller professional
    staff than we did in the early 1980s, as well as fewer support staff, but we review many
    times more merger filings. We have highly skilled and dedicated lawyers and economists,
    and an excellent senior management team. The Bureau of Competition and Bureau of Economics
    work closely together. Merger review is firmly grounded in facts and sound economic
    analysis. </p>
    <p>But as I said, not all is perfect. Thousands of mergers are filed each year, and some
    questionable transactions may slip through the screening process. The recent amendments to
    the HSR Act, which increased the filing threshold, may have made it more likely that we
    will miss a few problematic transactions. I have directed BC Director Joe Simons to
    increase our efforts in reviewing the business press and other sources to identify
    potentially problematic mergers. If you have clients that are concerned with a
    transaction, let us know - <em>whether or not it has been consummated</em>. We are quite
    prepared to go after consummated mergers or mergers that are too small to require an HSR
    filing. In addition, we will continue to vigorously pursue parties who do not comply with
    the procedural requirements of the HSR regulations, our first line of defense against
    anticompetitive mergers. Some of you may recall that, during my tenure as Bureau Director,
    we brought the first 7(a) case.<a HREF="#N_23_"><sup>(23)</sup></a></p>
    <p>Let me turn now to 2<sup>nd</sup> Requests. The burdens of the 2<sup>nd</sup> Request
    process continue to be a concern. Although the agencies have made substantial efforts to
    reduce the burden, there is room for further improvement. The number of boxes of documents
    submitted for a typical 2<sup>nd</sup> Request has sky-rocketed. Where once we had
    hundreds of boxes, in some matters we now have <em>thousands</em> of boxes. Of course,
    some mergers are very complex and tend to involve volumes of documents. Moreover, I have
    worked on enough mergers to know that you are not always trying to make the agency's job
    easy. In any event, given the burdens involved for both the merging parties and agency
    staff, we need to find ways to do our jobs more efficiently. We need to ensure that what
    you submit is as helpful as possible to our doing our job of protecting consumers. We will
    have more to say about this in the coming months. </p>
    <p>We are also trying to make merger investigations more efficient in other ways. As we
    all know, the statutory deadlines are almost never binding for a problematic merger.
    Because the deadlines are too short to analyze a complex merger fully, we usually arrange
    an accommodation for more time. Nonetheless, merger investigations, on average, probably
    take longer than necessary. We will try to expedite the process further. </p>
    <p>Improved communication is part of the answer. Both sides have to join issue on the
    critical aspects of a merger. If a merger appears problematic, the burden is on the
    parties to convince us that there are no problems or that any problems can be fully
    remedied with a suitable divestiture. Without jeopardizing our position in potential
    litigation, we can probably communicate more clearly to the parties the bases of our
    concerns. Joe Simons and I are working to develop and implement procedures to improve the
    merger review process without compromising the ability to do our job. </p>
    <p>In that vein, we will be conducting &quot;best practices&quot; sessions with the
    Antitrust Division, beginning with 2d Request and remedies issues, to strengthen both of
    our agencies. In addition, the Bureau of Competition is planning a series of &quot;brown
    bag&quot; lunches in Washington, D.C., and some of our regional offices to discuss your
    concerns about remedies. We hope that these steps will offer additional bases for
    improving the merger review process. </p>
    <p align="center"><strong>III. International Antitrust</strong> </p>
    <p>Let me turn to a new topic: competition policy in a global economy. Increasingly, U.S.
    companies and the U.S. antitrust agencies interact with our competition law counterparts.
    These interactions raise a multitude of procedural and substantive issues. The FTC is
    certain to give increasing attention to these international issues. Among other matters,
    we will:<ul>
      <li>Continue information exchanges with foreign antitrust enforcement authorities to promote
        the effective handling of particular matters involving multiple jurisdictions;</li>
      <li>Devote greater efforts to bi-lateral discussions with our foreign counterparts to
        establish a consensus about &quot;best practices&quot; in process and substantive
        analysis;</li>
      <li>Continue to participate in multinational initiatives (OECD, WTO, Global Competition
        Initiative, and others) to help streamline antitrust procedures and encouraging acceptance
        of the best analytical methods; and</li>
      <li>Continue our efforts to assist transition economies to build sensible competition policy
        and consumer protection systems.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our General Counsel, Bill Kovacic, has established within his office an international
    coordination function focusing on technical assistance to transition economies. To manage
    this function, I have appointed my long-time friend Jim Hamill to be Senior Counsel for
    International Affairs in the General Counsel's office. The Bureau of Competition's
    International Division, headed by Randy Tritell, will continue to handle liaison with
    foreign antitrust authorities and multinational institutions.</p>
    <p align="center"><strong>IV. Non-Merger Enforcement</strong> </p>
    <p>Let me move to a brief discussion of non-merger enforcement. There are several
    important issues here, such as competition in pharmaceuticals and intellectual property
    issues. As in the case of merger enforcement, facts are critical. Our cases will be
    empirically grounded. Sound theory is important, but it must fit the facts of the case. <a
    HREF="#N_24_"><sup>(24)</sup></a> </p>
    <p>My interest in non-merger enforcement should not be surprising. The Commission was very
    active in pursuing non-merger matters when I was the Director of the Bureau of Competition
    in the early1980s. During my tenure, we put 17 non-merger cases in &quot;Part III&quot;
    administrative litigation. Important cases such as <em>TICOR</em>,<a HREF="#N_25_"><sup>(25)</sup></a>
    <em>Superior Court Trial Lawyers Ass'n,<a HREF="#N_26_"><sup>(26)</sup></a></em> <em>Mass
    Board</em>,<a HREF="#N_27_"><sup>(27)</sup></a> <em>Detroit Auto Dealers,</em><a
    HREF="#N_28_"><sup>(28)</sup></a> <em>Taxicabs</em>,<a HREF="#N_29_"><sup>(29)</sup></a>
    and <em>U-Haul</em><a HREF="#N_30_"><sup>(30)</sup></a> were among that group. Each case
    that we litigated was decided against the respondents, including three that went to the
    Supreme Court.<a HREF="#N_31_"><sup>(31)</sup></a></p>
    <p>More recent developments confirm the importance of a strong non-merger agenda. We used
    to believe that antitrust counseling, at least for major companies, would generally deter
    anticompetitive conduct. We have learned, however, from <em>ADM</em>,<a HREF="#N_32_"><sup>(32)</sup></a>
    the vitamins case,<a HREF="#N_33_"><sup>(33)</sup></a> numerous other price-fixing cases,
    and from <em>Microsoft</em>,<a HREF="#N_34_"><sup>(34)</sup></a> that the antitrust
    agencies must aggressively police competitive conduct. In a recent matter the Commission
    issued Complaints because there was reason to believe that competitors engaged in <em>per
    se</em> violations. </p>
    <p>Let me now explore a few areas of current interest.</p>
    <p><strong>A. Hatch-Waxman Issues</strong></p>
    <p>The Pitofsky Commission was very active in looking at potential abuses of the
    Hatch-Waxman Act, which was intended to promote generic competition in the pharmaceutical
    industry. We are continuing those efforts. The competitiveness of the pharmaceutical
    industry is very important to American consumers. We have a number of active, ongoing
    investigations, and we are also conducting a study of Hatch-Waxman related issues. As you
    probably know, a number of legislative proposals have been made to modify Hatch-Waxman to
    curb the alleged abuses. Our study and our experience in investigating these issues may
    provide some guidance for potential modifications of the Act.</p>
    <p><strong>B. Horizontal Emphasis</strong></p>
    <p>It is uncontroversial that horizontal activities should be a major focus of non-merger
    enforcement. You can be sure that we are going to be very active in finding,
    investigating, and bringing actions against anticompetitive horizontal activities. We
    already have a number of new initiatives under way. The professions and health care are
    areas of particular interest. </p>
    <p>One of the issues we will be dealing with is the legal standard for judging some of
    these horizontal agreements. When I was at the Bureau of Competition in the 1980s, we
    developed a truncated rule of reason analysis that the Commission adopted in <em>Massachusetts
    Bd. of Registration of Optometry.</em><a HREF="#N_35_"><sup>(35)</sup></a> <em>Mass Board</em>
    applied a structured analysis that avoided a rigid <em>per se</em>/rule of reason
    categorization. It provided an intermediate form of analysis for inherently suspect
    restraints that appear likely, absent an efficiency justification, to restrict competition
    and reduce output. The Commission decided not to apply the <em>Mass Board</em> methodology
    in the <em>California Dental Association</em> case, opting instead to use the traditional <em>per
    se</em>/rule of reason categorization. It held the advertising restraints in that case to
    be unlawful under both the <em>per se</em> standard and an abbreviated rule of reason
    analysis. The Ninth Circuit affirmed under the abbreviated rule of reason theory, but the
    Supreme Court reversed, holding the Commission's analysis to be too abbreviated. What is
    required, said the Court, is &quot;an enquiry meet for the case, looking to the
    circumstances, details, and logic of a restraint.&quot;<a HREF="#N_36_"><sup>(36)</sup></a>
    It therefore teaches that facts, not rigid categories, should guide the analysis.</p>
    <p>In light of <em>CDA</em>, we have more work to do to develop a workable approach that
    is consistent with the law. I believe the Commission would have prevailed in that case had
    it been tried under the <em>Mass Board</em> standard, with record evidence to explain why
    the advertising restraints should be analyzed under a truncated approach. That evidence
    was available. There is plentiful empirical evidence demonstrating the deleterious effects
    on price and quality flowing from restrictions on professional advertising, but the record
    contained precious little of that evidence. Regardless of the precise form of truncated
    analysis one chooses to use, the key to prosecuting such a case successfully is to build a
    record that contains support for claims of probable anticompetitive effect.<a
    HREF="#N_37_"><sup>(37)</sup></a></p>
    <p>Two other issues we will be looking at are the <em>Noerr-Pennington</em> and State
    Action exemptions. You may recall that we brought cases involving these areas during my
    stint as Competition Bureau Director in the 1980s - <em>Ticor</em> and <em>U-Haul</em>.
    The Transition Report prepared by the ABA Antitrust Section stated that the state action
    exemption still presents concerns from a competition policy standpoint.<a HREF="#N_38_"><sup>(38)</sup></a>
    The Report recommended a reexamination of the scope of the exemption. We are doing that. </p>
    <p><strong>C. Monopolization</strong></p>
    <p>Some of you may be wondering what my position will be on monopolization cases. Again,
    it is the stubborn facts that count most. Where we can show that exclusionary conduct
    reasonably appears capable of making a significant contribution to creating or maintaining
    monopoly power, we will not hesitate to act.<a HREF="#N_39_"><sup>(39)</sup></a></p>
    <p>The strong appellate decision in <em>Microsoft </em>re-confirms that improper conduct
    by firms with monopoly power can give rise to substantial antitrust issues. The Commission
    will not back away from these types of cases, but they must be economically and factually
    sound. For example, in the <em>U-Haul</em> case that we brought in 1985, the complaint
    alleged that U-Haul and its parent AMERCO attempted to monopolize the market for rental
    moving equipment by engaging in a series of anticompetitive acts against a competitor in a
    Chapter 11 reorganization proceeding, Jartran, and that the respondents &quot;<em>in fact</em>
    injured competition by jeopardizing and substantially delaying Jartran's emergence as a
    reorganized company, capable of resuming its role as an effective competitor.&quot;<a
    HREF="#N_40_"><sup>(40)</sup></a> </p>
    <p><strong>D. Process Issues</strong></p>
    <p>We have always had a problem at the FTC with the speed and efficiency of non-HSR
    investigations. Unlike HSR, we do not have a statutory clock that pushes such cases. I
    have directed Joe Simons to develop and implement new procedures and controls. We want our
    non-merger enforcement activities to be &quot;timely, likely and efficient.&quot; </p>
    <p align="center"><strong>V. Non-Enforcement Initiatives</strong> </p>
    <p>One of the best innovations of the Pitofsky Commission was to be active in holding
    public hearings and workshops on substantial consumer protection and competition-related
    issues affecting the American economy. These proceedings help us develop a better
    understanding of new economic and business developments, and their consumer-related
    implications, in a non-adversarial process, and are useful to the Commission, the
    Congress, and others, by informing policy and possibly future enforcement decisions. We
    have already continued the practice of sponsoring these proceedings with our just
    concluded conference on Gasoline Prices last week.<a HREF="#N_41_"><sup>(41)</sup></a>
    There will be follow-up hearings on this issue over the next several months, and we will
    have similar hearings on other antitrust and consumer protection issues over the next few
    years. </p>
    <p>The FTC also has a long and distinguished history of being an advocate for competition
    and consumers in connection with federal, state, and local regulation. This is called our
    &quot;Advocacy Program.&quot; We will be selective in choosing where to intervene - our
    resources do not permit us to be everywhere, nor would that make sense - but we will be
    active. In a related vein, we will look for suitable opportunities to be a competition
    policy advocate as an <em>amicus curiae</em> in private litigation. Those cases will be
    limited to situations where we can make a contribution on important legal issues. </p>
    <p align="center"><strong>Conclusion</strong> </p>
    <p>Protecting consumers is the purpose of the antitrust laws and the mission of the
    Federal Trade Commission. I fully support our mission and a vigorous pro-consumer
    antitrust enforcement agenda. The &quot;stubborn facts&quot; of our actions will not
    support the preconceptions of some that we are here to put the brakes on antitrust. I look
    forward to working with the ABA to ensure that our antitrust enforcement is the best it
    can be to protect American consumers.</p>
