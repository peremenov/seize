        Tricks by Lisa Erickson</B><BR>
         <BR>
         Watering can be one of the biggest challenges to the gardener with
        limited strength or mobility. While it is easier physically to plant in
        pots, baskets and raised beds and boxes, these containers will dry out
        faster and require more frequent watering than will flower beds or
        gardens.<BR>
        </FONT><BR>
        <FONT FACE="Arial">Knowing how often to water is not always easy to
        figure out. If your plants are drooping they're almost certainly
        thirsty. Sticking your finger up to the second joint into the soil will
        quickly tell you if the plant needs water. If you can't reach hanging
        baskets, assume they need watering every day as it is difficult to
        overwater a plant that has adequate drainage and is exposed to the wind
        and sun. (This is quite different from the all-too-common problem of 
        overwatering indoor plants). </FONT><BR>
        <FONT FACE="Arial"></FONT><BR>
        <FONT FACE="Arial">Many gardeners insist that the only time to water is
        in the morning because the hot sun of midday will burn the moist leaves.
        If you can't water in the morning, water when it is convenient. Try not
        to water at night as moisture and darkness set up a perfect environment
        for pests like slugs and mosquitoes as well as diseases like mildew and
        black spot. When you do water, do it thoroughly. If you just sprinkle a
        little on top each day, your plants will develop shallow root systems
        that create weak plants. Be sure to have holes in your pots for drainage
        so that water doesn't pool in the bottom causing root rot.</FONT><BR>
        <FONT FACE="Arial"><BR>
         If you live in an apartment, it is especially helpful to have an
        outside hose bib attached on the balcony. Some builders make this a
        standard feature but many don't even consider it necessary. If you are
        fortunate enough to have a hose outlet, buy the shortest hose that will
        allow to reach everywhere on your deck. The shorter the hose the lighter
        it is making it easier to to maneuver and hang up afterwards. Usually 25
        feet with a 1/2&quot; diameter is plenty of hose for a balcony or patio.<BR>
         <BR>
         A hose attachment called a watering wand, a long, usually aluminum tube
        with a sprinkler-like nozzle, is a good investment. Wands are about 30&quot;
        long, allowing you to reach further, even from a sitting position, into
        the back of a flower bed or up high into a hanging basket or window box.
        There are even wands available with a 90 degree curve so that you water
        straight into hanging baskets. There are
        <A HREF="http://www.gardenscapetools.com/pages/wands.htm">shorter wands
          around 16&quot; </A>that are actually made for children but are quite
        light weight with soft foam grips and are extremely practical for those
        with little strength for lifting. Any watering wand attachment will
        allow you to water all of your plants without refilling a can, a great
        advantage when you have a lot of pots to maintain.<BR>
         <BR>
         If you don't have a water outlet on the balcony or deck you will need
        to haul water. Watering cans come in many styles and sizes. The metal
        ones are traditional but add water to them and they can be pretty heavy.
        Try a lighter weight plastic one in sizes from about 1 pint to 1 1/2
        gallons. If you keep a rain barrel on the deck you can fill from the top
        or use a hose from the bottom for filling. There are some quite
        sophisticated <A HREF="http://sprucecreekrainsaver.com/">models</A> on
        the market now with a spigot already in place.<BR>
         <BR>
         Of course, the best way to ease watering tasks is to plant wisely.
        Using a mulch in beds, raised or flat, helps preserve water. Plant
        <A HREF="http://www.acwd.org/plantsrt.html">drought resistant plants
        </A>, like portulaca (Portulaca grandiflorum), Sedum (Sedum spp.),
        Cleome (Cleome hasslerana), Dusty miller (Artemisia stellariana), Thyme
        (Thymus spp.), Shasta daisy (Chrysanthermum sperbum) that cope well with
        minimal watering. <BR>
         <BR>
         If you mostly work with pots, however, an extra step taken in the
        initial soil preparation can save many hours all summer long. Adding
        moisture retention granules helps reduce watering in any kind of
        contained planting. These polymers granules soak up the water and then
        slowly release it back into the soil as it dries out. Some potting
        mixtures come with granules already mixed in but these tend to be pretty
        expensive. A better alternative is to buy the granules in small packages
        and mix them in as you plant. That way you can place them in the bottom
        half of the pot where the roots of the plant will get the most benefit.
        Hanging moss baskets which often require daily watering in the middle of
        summer, can go from 2-3 days between watering.<BR>
