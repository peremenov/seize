<p><a name="MOVEMENT"><font face="Times New Roman"><b>THE ROLE OF
THE ABORIGINAL LEGAL RIGHTS MOVEMENT</b></font></a></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Aboriginal Legal Rights
    Movement Inc (ALRM) exists to get social justice for
    Aboriginal people and their communities. The Movement began
    in 1971 and was incorporated in 1973.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">ALRM is a non-profit
    organisation. We provide a legal service to Aboriginal people
    and their communities.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">ALRM works to keep law and
    justice systems honest. We demand recognition of our
    cultures. We fight for economic and social status for our
    dispossessed people.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Our role has expanded to
    include changing laws where needed, to improve social justice
    and further the fight for equal rights.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman"><b>Conflict
    Policy</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">For many years now, ALRM has
    had a policy of not allowing its lawyers to act in cases of
    conflict between Aboriginal people.<br>
    Both parties can still approach us for help, but we'll have
    to assess your cases to see if we need to arrange alternative
    representation.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman"><b>Field
    Officers</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">On the phone or in person,
    you should ask to speak to a Field Officer. They will listen
    to your questions, get some details about your situation, and
    find ways for you to get the answers, information and help
    you need.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">ALRM has a 24-hour answering
    service. You can get hold of a Field Officer during day-time
    office hours and, in the case of emergencies, at night. If
    you're ever picked up by the police, call us for help right
    away - before answering any questions.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman"><b>Criminal
    Section</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">ALRM lawyers cover most
    Courts in South Australia.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The lawyers give legal
    advice, represent you through all Court proceedings, help to
    prepare documents and assist with appeals.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><i><br>
    </i><b><i>Call us as soon as possible if you want a lawyer
    with you in Court.</i></b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The lawyers need you to tell
    them what you want, so they can handle your case the best
    way.</font><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman"><b> </b></font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman"><b>Civil
    Section</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This Section of ALRM works to
    get justice for you in non-criminal matters. We help you to
    get and use your own power through action and education.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This Section handles equal
    opportunity, family issues and separations, workers' and
    other compensation, police complaints, and community and
    corporate issues.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman"><b>Equal
    opportunity</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you think you've been
    discriminated against, we can help. We'll be there to support
    you if you want to make a complaint to the Equal Opportunity
    Commission. You can make the complaint yourself. Our Field
    Officers and lawyers will assist you at any stage.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman"><b>Family law</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Many of you speak to us about
    custody, access and maintenance of your children. We prepare
    Court documents, appear in Court with you and help you to
    reach a good solution. ALRM knows that going to Court about
    the family is stressful. We'll work to help you find a better
    way to deal with the problem.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman"><b>Workers
    compensation</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sometimes, when people are
    hurt at work, their claims are not accepted. If you need to,
    you can dispute your employer's or the insurer's decisions.
    ALRM can help you to get those decisions reviewed to get a
    fair result.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman"><b>Police
    complaints</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you've been treated badly
    by the police, come to us.<br>
    Your Field Officer will help you to lodge a Police Complaint
    statement.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The complaint goes to the
    Police Complaints Authority (PCA). The PCA is independent of
    the police and can investigate your complaint. ALRM will help
    you to make the statement, explain to you about the rest of
    the process and tell you what's happening as it goes along.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman"><b>Family
    separations</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">ALRM works with the
    Aboriginal Child Care Agency to write and give information to
    the National Enquiry by the Human Rights and Equal
    Opportunity Commission into the Separation of Indigenous
    Families. If you've got any questions, call us.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman"><b>Compensation</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you have suffered injury
    because of the actions of another person or organisation, you
    may be able to claim compensation. We can talk to you about
    this and help you go further.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman"><b>Community
    and corporate issues</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The ALRM Civil Section
    includes a Corporate Solicitor who can provide information,
    legal assistance and representation for community
    organisations and family groups.<br>
    If your group needs to be incorporated under Federal or State
    laws for funding purposes, we can help. In consultation with
    your group members, we can give you legal assistance to draft
    your constitution. We also can provide advice on meeting
    procedures, elections or other issues arising within
    Aboriginal community organisations.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman"><b>Copyright,
    Property, or Business matters</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you need information,
    ALRM's Civil Section will help you find the information you
    need.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman"><b>The
    Aboriginal Justice Advocacy Committee (AJAC).</b></font><font
    face="Times New Roman"> </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">ALRM and the South Australian
    State Department of Aboriginal Affairs (DOSAA) formed AJAC in
    June 1994. The Committee is funded by the Aboriginal and
    Torres Strait Islanders Commission (ATSIC) through DOSAA.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">AJAC monitors how the State
    Government meets the recommendations of the Royal Commission
    into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. We make sure that
    Aboriginal people are involved in getting those
    recommendations to work.<br>
    We keep you informed about what's happening.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Committee meets every
    month.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">We want the opinions and
    concerns of Aboriginal people about the Royal Commission, and
    how its recommendations are being put into practice. Contact
    your local AJAC representatives about what you think your
    Committee should be looking at and working on.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman"><b>Aboriginal
    Visitors Scheme </b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Scheme works across South
    Australia, and means that you don't have to be alone in the
    police cells if you are detained. ALRM pays for the time and
    travel of volunteer Aboriginal visitors who come to you to
    provide support. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><i>The police must contact
    the AVS every time they keep an Aboriginal person in a police
    cell.</i></b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">ALRM has visitors in
    Adelaide, Berri, Ceduna, Coober Pedy, Mount Gambier, Murray
    Bridge, Port Augusta, Port Lincoln, Port Pirie and Whyalla.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Visitors make sure you're not
    alone and that you're being treated properly.<br>
    They look after your rights, get you medical help if you need
    it, and contact your family if you want.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">If you haven't been treated
    properly, the visitor can make a report on that, so that you
    can lodge a Police Complaint.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman"><b>Anti-Poverty
    Unit</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This Unit used to be your
    Financial Counselling Service. <br>
    Now, we're doing more community education and fewer
    individual cases.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">ALRM is working to give
    Aboriginal people training on money matters.<br>
    We'll be setting up self-help groups in communities, and they
    will start up networks to give advice to others. You'll be
    able to make good financial decisions with good information.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Times New Roman"><b>The Native
    Title Unit (NTU)</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The NTU is based in Adelaide.
    <br>
    We make claims for Native Title or compensation.<br>
    We help sort out disagreements between people making claims.<br>
    We represent you in any matter connected with the Native
    Title Act.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The NTU is responsible for
    all land claims outside the Anangu Pitjatjantjara and
    Maralinga Tjarutja lands. If you think you're entitled to
    claim under the Native Title Act, write to us with the names
    of who's claiming, the area being claimed and who'll benefit
    from it.</font></p>
