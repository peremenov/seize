				<h3>Undergraduate Minor in Education</h3>
	<h4>The Program</h4>
<p>The Teacher Education Institute does not offer a program leading to an undergraduate degree, however it does offer undergraduate students a minor in education that introduces students to the profession of education and provides students an opportunity to explore education as a career and obtain a head start on their coursework leading to initial teacher certification through the University at Buffalo’s graduate school program, but <strong>this minor cannot in itself lead directly to teacher certification</strong>.</p>

<p>Although intended for those who will pursue certification in Adolescence education (Grades 7-12), the minor can be adapted for those interested in Early Childhood Education (birth to Grade 2) and/or Childhood Education (Grades 1-6).</p>
<h4>Acceptance Criteria</h4>
<p>Registration is open to students who formally apply to the minor and who receive confirmation of acceptance prior to registration.  Applications to the minor must be filed with the Teacher Education Institution (TEI) office in 375 Baldy Hall.  Applications must include UB DARS report and/or official transcripts from all institutions attended other than UB.  Students must have a minimum GPA of 2.5 for admission.
</p>
<h4>Course Sequence</h4>
<p>The minor in education consists of 19 credits as described below.</p>
<h5>Required Courses</h5>
<p>Educational Foundations (10 credits):</p>
<ul>
<li />LAI  350         Introduction to Education (4 credit hours)
<li />CEP 400          Educational Psychology (3 credit hours) *
<li />ELP 405          Sociology of Education (3 credit hours) *, +
</ul>

<h5>Electives</h5>
<p>At least 9 credits (3 courses) chosen from the following electives:</p>
<ul>
<li />LAI 205 Introduction to Child Development & Learning +, # 
<li />LAI 414 Language, Cognition, and Writing * 
<li />LAI 416 Early Childhood Education Theory & Practice 
<li />LAI 474 Teaching the Exceptional Learner +, # 
<li />LAI 490 Seminar and Practicum in Early Childhood 
<li />CEP 401 Introduction to Counseling
<li />CEP 404 Introduction to the Rehabilitation of Substance Abuse & Addiction 
<li />CEP 453 Introduction to Rehabilitation 


</ul>
<p>* May be applicable to Adolescence initial teacher certification program at UB<br />
+  May be applicable to Childhood initial/professional teacher certification program at UB<br />
#  May be applicable to  Early Childhood initial/professional teacher certification program at UB <br />
</p>
<h4>Recommended Sequence of Courses</h4>
<h5>First Year (sophomore year)</h5>
<p>Spring: LAI 350 (prerequisite for CEP 400 & ELP 405)</p>
<h5>Second Year</h5>
<p>Fall: CEP 400, ELP 405 (prerequisite for LAI 414) <br />
 Spring: LAI 414 or elective </p>
<h5> Third Year</h5> <p>Fall: Two courses from the list of electives</p> 
<p>The first course (LAI 350) in the minor is an introductory course that is not part of the required coursework for certification.  It does, however, have a field experience component, and early field experiences are required in the latest NYS Education Department regulations.
</p>
<p>The next two courses, CEP 400 and ELP 405, can be used to meet requirements for initial certification as an Adolescence teacher.  The final three courses in the minor are electives, which may also meet teacher certification course requirements (depending upon which curricular option the student eventually pursues).</p>

<p>Students who take CEP 400, ELP 405, and LAI 414, and complete them successfully, and who later pursue a UB program leading to initial teacher certification at the Adolescence level may include these courses in their coursework toward initial certification (but not the master’s degree).  This allows students to have a 9-credit head start toward their initial certification.</p>
<h4>Provisional Admission into the Teacher Certification Program</h4>
<p>Students who have completed 75 undergraduate credits in an approved major with a minimum GPA of 3.0 can apply on-line to an initial certification (i.e., advanced certificate without an Ed.M. degree) or initial/professional certification program (with Ed.M. degree) for provisional admission pending completion of their undergraduate degree.  Students who have been provisionally admitted and who have completed 90 undergraduate credits may take two graduate level education courses (upon advisement) and include them in their graduate program in education.
