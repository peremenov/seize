      <blockquote>Dear Tess and Nigel
<p>Thanks for the new issue of TEXT. I was interested to read Bill Manhire's 
        piece and agreed with much it said and especially the concept of opening 
        students to the concept of reaching into the dark. This ties in with the 
        article on the Prose Poem by Kevin Brophy and I would like to offer a 
        'response' to Kevin's piece.</p>
        <p><strong>THE PROSE POEM IN AUSTRALIA - AND ELSEWHERE</strong></p>
        <p>In his article <em>The Prose Poem: A Short History, a Brief Reflection 
          and a Dose of the Real Thing</em> Kevin Brophy gives a quick reading 
          of the history of this genre, beginning in France with Baudelaire and 
          finding, it would seem, some sort of fringe habitation in America. Brophy 
          then goes on to relate difficulties he has had in persuading his students 
          to attempt the forrn.</p>
      <p>I believe his 'difficulties' possibly relate to two things. Firstly, 
        from his article he seems not to have taken account of any Australian 
        attempts to develop the form, and secondly, the sense of resistance he 
        notes might be aligned with attempts to persuade students to write poetry 
        at all.</p>
        <p>This latter statement of mine is, perhaps, overstressing the point, 
          but I think many teaches of creative writing have found a certain resistance 
          among students to attempt poetry outside the old 'mainstream' formal 
          structures. This, in my experience, relates back to the general Australian 
          resistance to any forms of modernism in the 20th century and a suspicion 
          of experimentation as a self conscious literary device.</p>
        <p>At the basic level, new students often have great difficulty in even 
          writing about their local environment. Something far off, fantastic 
          (or fantasy-ful) or glamorous is often the instinctive choice. How many 
          futuristic or Gothic or Neanderthal epics have we seen from beginners? 
          To harness writers down to naming specific streets or suburbs is an 
          early but major task. To make the leap beyond habitation and specific 
          perception into the subjective dislocations and leaps of association 
          implicit in the prose poem is a leap indeed.</p>
      <p>Perhaps if we had an anthology of the Prose Poem in Australia the task 
        os teachers might be considerably lightened. And some very exciting possibilities 
        opened up.</p>
        <p>In 1982 when I was writer-in-residence at Deakin University in Geelong 
          their magazine <em>Mattoid</em> published an interview with me on the 
          prose poem. This was reprinted in 1990 in my collection of essays, <em>Biting 
          the Bullet</em> (Simon &amp; Schuster) and in that I gave not only a 
          run-down on the development of the form, from 19th century France to 
          modern English explorations of the genre, most notably in the U.S. (and 
          leaning on Latin American exemplars, which in the 1960s became suddenly 
          available in translation in the States). Kevin Brophy does not mention 
          the great rise of prose poems in the Latin America, nor Europe, but 
          these were pertinent phases. When Mark Strand and Charles Simic published 
          <em>Another Republic</em> in 1976 (Ecco NY) they made a major step in 
          introducing 17 contemporary poets in English translation. Of these, 
          no less than seven were represented with prose poems, several of them 
          entirely in this form: Francis Ponge, Henri Michaux, Zbigniew Herbert, 
          Julio Cortazar, Octavio Paz, Miroslav Holub and Italo Calvino. Most 
          of these names are now well know, even in Australia.</p>
      <p>My interview article explored some of the reasons these took hold in 
        the creative minds of an important segment of American poets. What I did 
        not mention was that American poetry at that stage had already massively 
        broken with old formal traditions, and 'field poetry' offered an even 
        greater sense of flexibility and layout experiment than the prose poem. 
        Nevertheless, it can be said the prose poem did establish its place and 
        there are many more collections of great interest published than is hinted 
        at in Kevin Brophy's (admittedly concise) article.</p>
        <p>The development of the form in Australia was outlined in my piece, 
          and it might be useful to re-print it at the end of this small response. 
          I had been interested - and still am - in the concept of an anthology 
          of prose poems from Australia, though to date I have not managed to 
          interest a publisher. Perhaps it is now time. </p>
        <p>When I edited the UQP verse anthology <em>The Moment Made Marvellous</em> 
          in 1998 I included prose poems by Pamela Brown, Joanne Bums, Gary Catalano 
          and Judith Rodriguez (her <em>Borges at 73</em> also invokes one of the 
          most influential of the influential Latin American experimenters in 
          the form, seen at its most expansive and flexible).</p>
        <p>Certainly as a technique, the prose poem continues to attract Australian 
          poets and there are a considerable number of book-length collections 
          that have been published here. I could list, for instance, Andrew Taylor's 
          <em>Parabolas</em> (which as I mentioned in my Mattoid interview was 
          the first book of prose poems to be published in this country), two 
          books by Bruce Beaver (<em>Headlands</em> UQP 1986 and <em>As It Was</em> 
          UQP 1979), two by myself (<em>Turning Full Circle </em>New Poetry 1979 
          and <em>Stump and Grape and Bopple-nut Bullion </em>1982), several stunning 
          books by Gary Catalano (including <em>Fresh Linen</em>, UQP 1988), Ania 
          Walwicz, Laurie Duggan (including the award-winning <em>The Ash Range</em>, 
          Picador 1987), Rodney Hall's <em>The Most Beautiful World</em> (UQP 
          1981), all of Philip Hammiell's books from 1976 to 1994, Rudi Krausmann's 
          <em>From Another Shore</em> (Wild &amp; Woolley 1975), Gerard Lee's 
          <em>Manual For a Garden Mechanic</em> (1976), Alison Croggon's <em>Nevigato</em> 
          (Black Pepper 1996), and books by Pamela Brown, Joanne Bums and Anna 
          Couani. And that is only skimming the surface.</p>
        <p>In addition, many Australian poets have published occasional prose 
          poems which are included in their general collections: Chris Wallace-Crabbe, 
          David Malouf and Kevin Hart, on to M.T.C.Cronin, Luke Davies, John Scott, 
          John Kinsella and Michael Sarabin, again to name only a few.</p>
        <p>What these lists do suggest is that as a distinct genre, the prose 
          poem in Australia is alive and well. Probably in better health than 
          the Sestina, the Sonnet or the Haiku.</p>
      <p>The advantage of an anthology, now, would be to suggest to teachers of 
        creative writing in Australia something of the Australian development 
        of the form. And it has taken, I think, specifically Australian resonances. 
        If it could be said to remain essentially lyrical in its preoccupation 
        with language (and even cadence), it is more gently satirical and sometimes 
        even rueful than its American counterparts. It has less anger, more stoicism. 
        Less extravagance, more essential caution. We are, let us remember, a 
        supremely cautious people. The Tampa affair has, most recently, all too 
        clearly illustrated that.</p>
        <p>But the Australian evolution of the prose-poem is no merely pallid 
          thing, a sort of pale reflection of the wan English versions (and, as 
          with recent English art works which set out to shock, the English prose 
          poem has a terrible posing safety-pin-in-the-nostril and stud-in-the-penis 
          determination that merely chafes). It also has something of the Australian 
          laconic wit and defiance, and it can get under the skin of the more 
          conventional verse structures, which bear the ghostly train of the measured 
          cadence still. As Kevin Brophy says, the prose poem is subversive. That 
          is something Australians have always been good at, even if they are 
          outwardly cautious and conformist. If young readers could see something 
          of the range and scope that has evolved over the last generation of 
          our poets, they might be more able to see for themselves how and where 
          the adventure might take them.</p>
        <p>
      <blockquote>THE 1982 INTERVIEW WITH MATTOID: ON PROSE POETRY
          <p>Mattoid: <em>Could we start, Tom, by discussing the genre of the prose 
            poem? There seems perhaps a contradiction of terms here. Poetry and 
            prose are separate matters, how can you put them together and expect 
            them to be a 'real' form? What do you think a prose poem can do that 
            either a poem or prose can't do?</em></p>
          <p>Tom Shapcott: Your statement that it seems a contradiction in terms 
            is the point at which the prose poem began. Most true prose poems 
            operate from a sense of contradiction or I'd prefer to say the tension 
            between certain sorts of claims being made upon language. The basic 
            claims are the demands of an innate lyricism and the demands of prose 
            realism. I think the genre as it has evolved in the last 120 or 130 
            years or so has tried to make use of the intrinsically dramatic conflict 
            involved. To place it in its historical perspective: the first sustained 
            attempts were by Charles Baudelaire - works written as a result of 
            heightened states through drug-taking. It was the urgency of getting 
            something down, I'm sure, that made him write these as prose. He was 
            a superb craftsman, and he discovered that something came through 
            which was different from what would have resulted had he attempted 
            it in a stanzaic form. There are precursors to that sort of discovery: 
            in the English language Walt Whitman used a non-stanzaic loping structure 
            at a time when it was a real innovation; this was based on the dynamics 
            of the Hebraic psalms, which involve a counterbalance in each sentence. 
            But Baudelaire's prose poems opened up further ways - they were celebratory, 
            in other words, lyrical, but they used the language of ordinary conversational 
            discourse. And it was through the conflict between these two forces 
            that something inherently different came out. The French tradition 
            ever since has explored this. In English, such experimentation was 
            much slower. Eliot's early attempts were quasi-translations of the 
            French, and he later abandoned the form. Then, in the 1920s and 1930s, 
            other (mainly American) writers made sporadic experiments... </p>
          <p>M: <em>Your summary of the prose poem's origins and relationships raises 
            several interesting points about the form. Just before we pursue those, 
            though, could you bring your survey up to date? </em></p>
          <p>TS: American, English, even Australian poets had done the odd little 
            exercise. from the 1920s onward. But the form in English came to a 
            new stage of richness from the late 1950s when American poets started 
            using the prose poem in a serious and sustained way. This was through 
            their postwar interest in European and especially Spanish-language 
            poetry and translations. The Spanish-speaking countries had, as it 
            were, spontaneously fallen for the combination of vigour and violence 
            implicit in the structure. In Australia, Chris Wallace-Crabbe was 
            the first poet to tackle it seriously as a form. He was influenced, 
            though, by the French prose poem, which had become a much more elegant 
            and almost 'courtly' study in layers of irony. Through the last decade 
            the Americans have widely explored the possibilities of the clash 
            between the extrovert dynamism and greed and introverted idealism 
            and despair, and the prose poem allowed them to hit the raw nerve 
            of the subconscious - wham - in a way that had only been tentative 
            before - say, in the work of e e cummings... </p>
          <p>M: <em>To pursue that question of form and expectations: if the line-breaks 
            in a poem suggest how we should read it, what means does the prose 
            poem have of directing the expectations we bring to it? </em></p>
          <p>TS: Very often the 'poetic' part of the prose poem is expressed through 
            an appeal to illogic: to states of receptivity which deny what we 
            have come to expect prose to offer - that is, rational discourse, 
            descriptive clarity, even rhetoric in its conventional sense of persuasion, 
            of using language to set certain cogs in motion. The prose poem creates 
            its lyrical frisson by pointing the reader's anticipatory glands in 
            that direction, and then somehow working a change ... Also, the prose 
            poem seems very much a present-tense form. It operates on a sense 
            of immediacy: I am doing this, this is happening to me. And that's 
            immediately conducive to a dream state, because a dream has exactly 
            that things-are-happening-to-me-now feeling. What's implicit is that 
            I am a passive receiver of certain things. Things flow around the 
            &quot;I&quot;. This has become characteristic of a lot of prose poetry: 
            an observer is operated on by all sorts of things, some magical, some 
            absolutely mundane. Often the juxtaposition becomes the active force 
            - 'I am sitting in a car there is a blue pram being wheeled past by 
            a lady wearing a pink floral eiderdown...' The naming quality becomes 
            important.</p>
          <p>M: <em>So although some of your prose poems suggest a narrative, that's 
            not the important thing? </em></p>
          <p>TS: No. But there's another interesting quality of the prose poem 
            apart from that surreal experience presented with the openness of 
            a passive dream state. This is the implicitly dramatic context of 
            a you-and-me. The poem becomes a dialogue between writer and reader. 
            Many of the more bizarre elements of a lot of prose poems attempt 
            to provoke the reader into participating in what the work offers. 
            Sometimes shock tactics are used. Sometimes coercive tactics. </p>
          <p>M: <em>I've noticed that in some of your prose poems there's also a dialogue 
            within yourself, or there's an implied interlocutor, and perhaps very 
            occasionally a dramatic impersonation. </em></p>
      <p>TS: Yes, though that's less characteristic of the form than the use of 
        surrealism. This is a way in which surrealism has become legitimate, opening 
        up possibilities that seem not just jejune. </p>
          <p>M: <em>Are there other ways, then, in which voices, or points of view, 
            are important in the prose poem? </em></p>
          <p>TS: I suggest that the best prose poems of the twentieth century 
            have all tended to be groups of poems which build up into sequences. 
            Octavia Paz, in his book-length <em>Eagle of Sun </em>(the first major 
            Latin-American essay in the form, by the way), uses the &quot;I&quot; 
            as an ordinary person full of practicalities, involved with ordinary 
            functions, who is also exploring what it is to be a Mexican, and as 
            well having a vision of the old Aztec gods in the present-day world. 
            All these things cohere because of the surrealism and typical Spanish 
            violence of the juxtapositions, the balance between flat prose and 
            highly florid colouration. It only works as a sequence: each small 
            piece builds upon the next and upon the next, like infinite variation. 
          </p>
          <p>M: <em>So you get both the advantage of lyricism, which you mentioned 
            earlier, and the more extended scope of prose? </em></p>
          <p>TS: This is where the prose poem can develop as a major form. It's 
            a way of creating a lyrical epic, if you like, without a narrative 
            but with an implied dramatic context, so that all those things we've 
            been talking about, tensions within even the essence of the word, 
            the words as they cling together in a sentence, are expanded and built 
            upon in this larger accretion. The most exciting and successful prose 
            poems of the last twenty years have taken this form - such as Italo 
            Calvino's <em>Invisible Cities</em>, Robert Bly has also done three 
            or four books of prose poems; they're small sequences because Bly 
            is always a miniaturist, but all explore that capacity for growth 
            through accretion. In Australia, Andrew Taylor's <em>Parabolas </em>was 
            a pivotal work, the first book-length collection of prose poems here. 
            To mention just a couple of other Australian writers: Anna Couani 
            attempts a form closer to the non-narrative short-story but with all 
            the lyricism of an eternally displaced present-tense I mentioned before. 
            Robert Kenny in <em>Etcetera</em> tries to recreate and explore his 
            childhood in the early 1950s: he uses short prose forms that list 
            just a few non-essential items suddenly isolated to give that strange 
            intensity like an unexpected photograph of a familiar scene. The book 
            itself might not 'live' more than a few years, but its importance 
            is greater than can be objectively measured: it's already given rise 
            to other collections of a similar sort ?? by Laurie Duggan and Denis 
            Gallagher, for instance. </p>
          <p>M: <em>Among the titles you mention </em>Parabolas<em> and your own 
            </em>Turning Full Circle <em>both use the image of the curve, of the 
            momentum that comes back to itself. Presumably recurrence is important 
            in those sequences of prose poems you're talking about? </em></p>
          <p>TS: Yes, that hits very much to the centre. Finding what's within 
            the circle. The greatest of all French prose poets must be Francis 
            Ponge and his <em>Soap</em> is a great circular pattern of finding and 
            refinding...I hadn't previously traced that as an overriding formal 
            focus, though I'd been intrigued by the capacity of the prose poem 
            to work through extended groupings - and certainly the 'rondo' or 
            'variation' musical forms had seemed somehow parallel. </p>
          <p>M: <em>Yet in your own </em>Turning Full Circle<em> you do use the image 
            of music from time to time so you have that sense of development of 
            motif, its recurrence and variation. </em></p>
          <p>TS: In my collection there were certain recurring motifs and a self-conscious 
            preoccupation with 'turning full circle', of ending up where you started 
            - but you never come back to where you started with exactly the same 
            perspective. </p>
          <p>M: <em>Yes, there's no sense of any contrived connections and yet they 
            obviously do relate to one another. </em></p>
          <p>TS: One has preoccupations in any time of one's life. But others 
            which are much more basic come through. For the very last group I 
            looked back - and then I tried to do different things, partly because 
            I felt I'd been following a certain thread, seeing where it led, and 
            suddenly I thought: no, there are other things that can be done too 
            in this form. That was where I introduced the short-loin chops - to 
            create a compressed short-story resonance. I used a third person there 
            as a contrast. The temptation was to bust the form open, try something 
            wider...
        </blockquote> 
        <p><br>
          Reading that interview again, these decades later, I am of course struck 
          with the extended book-length prose poem sequence that have been achieved 
          in Australia in more recent years. Certainly Laurie Duggan's <em>The 
          Ash Range</em> stands out, but also John Tranter's recent <em>Different 
          Hands</em> (Folio/Fremantle Arts Centre Press 1998), which calls itself 
          'seven stories', comes more truly into the genre of prose poem (and, 
          for that matter, some of David Brooks' stories similarly lean in that 
          direction rather than as straightforward 'prose'). I myself have always 
          considered my novel <em>White Stag of Exile </em>more truly a prose poem. 
          The thing is, I must maintain, we now have an achieved body of work 
          in this form. We should know more about it. Knowing it more closely, 
          we can teach it more ably. That is my belief. </p>

<p><strong><em>from Moya Costello</em></strong></p>
      <p> 
      <blockquote> To the Editors, 
        <p>Re Kevin Brophy's paper 'The Prose Poem: A Short History, a Brief Reflection 
          and a Dose of the Real Thing' in the April 2002 edition of Text: http://www.gu.edu.au/school/art/text/april02/<a href="../april02/brophy.htm">brophy.htm</a>, 
          I quote from the paper:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>While the subversive French poetic form of vers libre was taken up 
            by English writers in the modernist era to the point where free verse 
            now dominates poetry written in English, <strong>there has been no comparable 
            interest in the prose poem among English-speaking writers.</strong> [my 
            emphasis]</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>For the Soundings '97 poetry conference in Adelaide, I delivered a 
          paper on the prose poem (unpublished, though similar comments in it 
          appear in my articles 'The Fetishized Fragment'? Nah! 'Flow sucks'! 
          <em>Redout</em> 28 1999 and 'An Effort of Non-compliance' online in<em> 
          M/C Reviews</em> at <a href="http://moby.curtin.edu.au/%7Eausstud/mc/reviews/features/women/effort.html">http://moby.curtin.edu.au/~ausstud/mc/reviews/features/women/effort.html</a>). 
          The conference paper was entitled 'the prose poem says find me'. It's 
          a quote from joanne burns' manifesto in that now classic text <em>Poetry 
          and Gender from Brooks and Walker </em>(UQP 1989). burns talks of herself 
          as 'a hybrid, prose poetie sort of poet'. In the same book Pamela Brown 
          says of her prose pieces that they are 'snapshots of conditions. Incidents 
          of emotion. Episodes from a long running serial. Chronicles of a transition 
          which is never completed'.</p>
        <p>The best exemplary practitioners of the prose poem to be found anywhere 
          at any time are among contemporary Australian women writers (often categorised 
          as feminist/experimental), including burns and Brown. Anna Couani and 
          Susan Hampton are two more. </p>
        <p>Brophy comments in his paper: </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>One consequence of the relative neglect of the prose poem in English 
            is its lasting presence as a subversive and alternative poetic tradition: 
            a permanent shadow thrown by the dominance of free verse; a niggling 
            outsider; an exotic and possibly decadent third way somewhere between 
            prose and poetry.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>All of the women I mention above have been working in the form since 
          at least the early 1980s. All of them at one stage belonged to the Sydney 
          Women Writers' Workshop, a workshop characterised as feminist and experimental, 
          and one of its aims for being set up was to counter patriarchal practices 
          in writing and publishing. The four women mentioned have, between them, 
          have published over 20 books. </p>
        <p>Hampton's first book Costumes (1981) contained some prose poems gems 
          such as 'The Kitchen of Aunty Mi and Aunty Pearl', and her latest fantastic 
          book, <em>A Latin Primer</em> (Cerberus 1998), could be said to contain 
          one long extended (brilliant) prose poem. </p>
        <p>Brophy asks and answers his question:</p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>What does it feel like then to be writing a prose poem? </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><br>
          In her statement in <em>Poetry and Gender</em> burns says: </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>the prose poem, the poem in the prose is more humble, or perhaps 
            more patient, more subtle. it knows the potential, the freedom of 
            not being too obvious. the prose poem says find me. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Anna Gibbs noted in her paper on feminism and fictocriticism (Text 
          October 1997): http://www.gu.edu.au/school/art/text/oct97/<a href="../oct97/gibbs.htm">gibbs.htm</a>, 
          that the prose poem is one of the 'indeterminate forms' of 'literary 
          detritus' that fictocriticism makes use of. (Heather Kerr and Amanda 
          Nettelbeck edited <em>The Space Between: Australian Women Writing Fictocriticism</em> 
          (UWA 1998), and Gail Jones work in T<em>he House of Breathing</em> (FACP 
          19992) and <em>Fetish Live</em>s (FACP 1997) is regarded as fictoctiticial. 
          These might be places to look further for Australian women writing the 
          prose poem.) </p>
        <p>I was very concerned to have my collection of short prose pieces <em>Small 
          Ecstasies</em> (UQP 1994) not described as a collection of short stories, 
          because it contains a variety of short prose forms, including the prose 
          poem.</p>
