                    Committee on Immunization Practices is expected to make recommendations 
                    in June on whether Americans should be vaccinated against 
                    smallpox, a disease that no longer exists on the planet. 
                  <P> The United States and the rest of the world have been comfortable 
                    for more than two decades in the knowledge that the last case 
                    of smallpox occurred in 1977, and the disease was declared 
                    completely eradicated in 1980. After eliminating stocks of 
                    the virus in laboratories worldwide, the World Health Organization 
                    was able to say in 1984 that the only remaining variola virus 
                    isolates are stored at just two sites: the Centers for Disease 
                    Control and Prevention in Atlanta and the State Research Center 
                    of Virology and Biotechnology in Novosibirsk, Russia. 
                  <P> But there are lingering concerns that the virus resides 
                    outside those laboratories and could be used as a weapon by 
                    terrorists. And the effects of such a terrorist attack would 
                    be catastrophic, say public health officials, for two reasons: 
                    the virus is highly contagious and spreads readily and rapidly 
                    from person to person, and almost no one in the United States 
                    is immune to the infection. Smallpox vaccination has not been 
                    performed routinely in this country since 1972, so there is 
                    now a large population of children and young adults who were 
                    never immunized. And even persons born before 1972, who probably 
                    received a smallpox vaccination in order to enter school and 
                    have the scar to prove it, may no longer be immune, since 
                    no one knows exactly how long vaccination-induced immunity 
                    lasts. 
                  <P> That means almost everyone in the United States would potentially 
                    be at risk if terrorists introduced the smallpox virus, either 
                    by sending infected persons to mingle with crowds or by disseminating 
                    the virus itself in the air or on commonly used objects. That 
                    poses questions for the Committee on Immunization Practices, 
                    including: 
                  <UL>
                    <LI>Should we act now to make smallpox vaccine available to 
                      everyone in the United States, or, alternatively, to young 
                      people between the ages of one year and 29 who were never 
                      vaccinated; and should vaccination be compulsory or voluntary? 
                    <LI>Or should we wait until there is an attack, relying on 
                      the fact that immunization within two or three days of exposure 
                      seems to prevent or lessen the severity of smallpox?
                  </ul>
                  <P> A number of factors may enter into the committee's decisions. 
                    One is whether there is enough smallpox vaccine to carry through 
                    whatever recommendation the committee may come up with. There 
                    is currently a limited stockpile of vaccine in this country, 
                    most of it produced in 1982 or earlier. In studies published 
                    in April in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>, researchers 
                    reported that they found those vaccines can be diluted 5- 
                    to 10-fold "without substantial loss of efficacy." "When administered 
                    by a bifurcated needle to previously unvaccinated adults, 
                    the vaccine produced vesicular skin lesions that correlate 
                    with the induction of the antibody and T-cell responses that 
                    are considered essential for clearing vaccinia virus infections."

                  <font face="arial" size="2">
                  <P> That means, says Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes 
                    of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, that "The current stockpile 
                    of 15 million doses of smallpox vaccine may safely be diluted 
                    to yield at least 75 million doses." In addition, he points 
                    out, the ongoing production of second-generation smallpox 
                    vaccines will increase our supply to approximately 286 million 
                    doses by the end of this year, and the Department of Health 
                    and Human Services has said it will test for safety and immunogenicity 
                    some 75 million doses of vaccine that recently were discovered 
                    to have been stored by a pharmaceutical company since 1972. 
                    "Thus, the availability of vaccine will soon become less of 
                    a factor in the formulation of a policy," Fauci said. 
                  <P> Another point the advisory committee may consider is how 
                    immunization on a massive scale might be handled, either before 
                    or during a terrorist attack. In its successful campaign to 
                    eradicate smallpox worldwide 40 years ago, the World Health 
                    Organization relied on a technique called "ring vaccination," 
                    which is the approach currently recommended in guidelines 
                    developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
                    In ring vaccination, patients with suspected or confirmed 
                    smallpox are isolated; contacts are traced, vaccinated, and 
                    kept under close surveillance; and high-risk persons who may 
                    have had direct or indirect contact with the patient are identified 
                    and vaccinated. 
                  <P> "Despite the fundamental soundness of this approach and 
                    its success in previous naturally occurring outbreaks, there 
                    is considerable skepticism about the feasibility of this strategy," 
                    in the event of a terrorist attack, Fauci notes, since multiple 
                    exposures and the resulting panic could overwhelm the capacity 
                    of CDC and local authorities to carry out the plan. And most 
                    importantly, he points out, previous outbreaks that were controlled 
                    by ring vaccination were in the context of existing herd immunity, 
                    not in an essentially non-immune population. 
                  <P> But the factor that seems most likely to affect public opinion 
                    about the need to vaccinate in advance of an attack, says 
                    Dr. William Bicknell of the Boston University School of Public 
                    Health, is that smallpox vaccination often has adverse reactions 
                    in otherwise healthy persons. Commonly, researchers reported, 
                    the healthy young volunteers who received either full-strength 
                    or dilute vaccine to test its efficacy experienced side effects 
                    including the formation of satellite lesions, regional lymphadenopathy, 
                    fever, headache, nausea, muscle aches, fatigue, and chills, 
                    as well as generalized and local rashes.  <P>

                  <P> In studies reported to the Pediatric Academic Societies 
                    annual meeting in Baltimore, Maryland, May 7, pediatricians 
                    Alex Kemper and Matthew Davis of the University of Michigan 
                    predicted that a mass campaign to vaccinate Americans against 
                    smallpox could result in 200 to 300 deaths and might make 
                    several thousand people severely ill with complications such 
                    as viral infection spreading from the vaccination site and 
                    severe skin rashes. "There's no other vaccine that we currently 
                    give that carries with it a risk of death," Kemper pointed 
                    out. "From a societal viewpoint, we have to decide whether 
                    or not we're willing to take this risk." 
                  <P> But in making its recommendations, the advisory committee 
                    is expected to weigh the very serious nature of smallpox itself 
                    against the possibility of adverse reactions to immunization 
                    in a limited number of people. Most doctors and nurses now 
                    in practice have never seen a case of smallpox, but a doctor 
                    who treated 22 smallpox patients while stationed with the 
                    military in Japan in 1945 described the experience in a <i>New 
                    England Journal of Medicine</i> article. "The disease began 
                    with a high fever," Dr. Murray Dworetzky recalled, "with the 
                    temperature exceeding 40 degrees Centigrade and then dropping, 
                    although never to normal, before it spiked again. Although 
                    some patients had pustular lesions, those who died had confluent 
                    subcutaneous hemorrhages that rapidly involved the entire 
                    body, with a similar enanthema involving the mucous membrances 
                    of the oral cavity, respiratory mucosa, and entire gastrointestinal 
                    tract. The pain was intense and morphine relieved it only 
                    marginally." Fourteen of the 22 patients died. 
                  <P> Another <i>New England Journal</i> article notes that the 
                    incubation period for the disease is 7 to 17 days, after which 
                    severe backache, headache, and fever begin abruptly. Lesions 
                    occur first on the face and extremities but then cover the 
                    entire body. After severe smallpox, pockmarks or pitted lesions 
                    are seen in 65 to 80 percent of survivors, most commonly on 
                    the face. Death from smallpox is ascribed to toxemia, associated 
                    with immune complexes, and to hypotension. 
                  <P> In any case, the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> 
                    editorializes, "The debate on preemptive vaccination cannot 
                    go on indefinitely. We need to make a decision. If we do proceed 
                    with large-scale vaccination, we need to consider what operational 
                    plans might be workable, who should be immunized, when they 
                    should be immunized, and how to reduce unintended sequelae."
