President Bush Signs African Growth and Opportunity Act
</b></font>
<br>
Remarks by the President at Signing of the Agoa Acceleration Act of 2004<br>
Dwight David Eisenhower Executive Office Building 





<p> THE PRESIDENT:  Thanks for coming.  In just four years, the African
Growth and Opportunity Act has shown the power of free markets to
improve the lives of people in both the United States and Africa.  By
reducing barriers to trade, this law has increased export, created
jobs, and expanded opportunity for Africans and Americans alike.  It
has given American businesses greater confidence to invest in Africa,
and encouraged African nations to reform their economies and
governments to take advantage of the opportunities that AGOA provides.
So today I'm pleased to build on that success and extend the law's
benefits long into the future by signing the AGOA Acceleration Act of
2004.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/07/images/20040713-3_agoagreet071304-515h.html"><img src="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/07/images/20040713-3_agoagreet071304-250h.jpg" alt="After signing into law the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) Acceleration Act of 2004, President George W. Bush meets with ceremony attendees in the Dwight D. Eisenhower Executive Office Building Tuesday, July 13, 2004. White House photo by Paul Morse." border="0" align="right" width="254" height="171"></a> This legislation is a product of strong bipartisan cooperation, and
I thank the members of the House and the Senate for working together on
this very important piece of legislation.  And I want to thank those in
the audience who worked hard to see that the bill made it to my desk as
quickly as it did.</p>


<p> Mr. Secretary, thank you very much for your leadership.  Secretary
Powell is a strong believer in the potential of the continent of
Africa, and so am I.</p>

<p> I appreciate so very much Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist for
joining us today.  Senator, thank you for coming.  I'm pleased to see
that my friend, the Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee, Max
Baucus, is still standing.  And I appreciate your
leadership, sir.  We're honored that Dick Lugar, who is the Chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is with us.  Mr. Chairman,
thank you, and thank you for your clear vision for a better world.  I
appreciate so very much the members of the Ways and Means Committee who
are here with us -- the Chairman and Ranking Member -- Chairman Bill
Thomas, who's worked so hard for this legislation, as has his friend
and Ranking Member, Charlie Rangel, both fine members of the Congress.
Thank you all for being here, and thanks for your good work.  I also am
honored that Ed Royce, the Chairman of the International Relations
Sub-committee on Africa, has joined us, and soon will be joined by
Donald Payne, the Ranking Member, as well.</p>

<p> These members put in good work.  They worked hard.  They brought
the other members of Congress along with them, many of whom are with
us.</p>

<p> I am honored that the dean of the African Diplomatic Corps stands
with me today.  Mr. Ambassador, thank you for coming.  I'm proud you're
here.  And thank you for representing the other ambassadors who have
joined us today.  We appreciate you taking time to come.  And thanks
for supporting this legislation.</p>

<p> There's a growing consensus in both Africa and the United States
that open trade and international investment are the surest and fastest
ways for Africa to make progress.  That's what you have said; that's
what Congress had responded to.  For too many years, the world's
efforts to promote Africa's development were focused on aid.
Development aid is important.  Nothing wrong with aid.  And my
administration has substantially increased aid to Africa, and we
appreciate working with the members to do that.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/07/images/20040713-3_agoasign071304-515h.html"><img src="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/07/images/20040713-3_agoasign071304-250h.jpg" alt="President George W. Bush signs into law the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) Acceleration Act of 2004 in the Dwight D. Eisenhower Executive Office Building Tuesday, July 13, 2004. White House photo by Paul Morse." border="0" align="right" width="254" height="169"></a> But as Uganda's President Museveni has said, "By itself, aid cannot
transform societies.  Only trade can foster the sustained economic
growth necessary for such transformation."  This African leader
understands that when nations close their markets and opportunity is
hoarded by a privileged few, no amount of development aid is ever
enough.  But when nations respect their people, open their markets,
expand freedom and opportunity to all their citizens, entire societies
can be lifted out of poverty and despair.  This is a hopeful piece of
legislation.  As America works for open markets and opportunity on the
African continent, we will also confront disease and hunger and the
violence that undermines progress and hope.</p>

<p> I'm deeply concerned about the humanitarian and human rights crisis
in Darfur, Sudan.  For the sake of peace and basic humanity, I echo the
sentiments of the Secretary of State.  I call upon the government of
Sudan to stop the Janjaweed violence.  I call on all parties of the
conflict to respect the cease-fire, to respect human rights, and to
allow for the free movement of humanitarian workers and aid.  The
United States and the United Nations and the leadership of the African
Union are working to bring relief to the suffering people of that
region.  America will continue to strongly support these efforts for
peace.</p>

<p> One way to spread peace is to encourage political and economic
reform across Africa by opening markets here in the United States.
It's important for our people to understand, by opening United States
markets we make it more likely there will be peace on the continent of
Africa.</p>

<p> AGOA nations are strengthening the rule of law.  They are lowering
trade barriers, they're combating corruption, and eliminating child
labor.  They're setting an important example for the entire continent,
demonstrating that governments that respect individual rights and
encourage the development of their markets are more likely to grow
economically and achieve political stability.</p>

<p> Like all good partnerships, AGOA has been beneficial to all
parties.  Free trade between the United States and sub-Sahara Africa
has created jobs, wealth, and opportunity on both continents.  Last
year, under AGOA, African exports to the United States increased by 55
percent, and African -- and American businesses saw a 15-percent
increase in our exports to sub-Sahara Africa that equals almost $7
billion.  The most notable gains were made by American companies
selling agricultural goods and machinery and transportation equipment.</p>

<p> See, when you sell goods in Africa, it means somebody is finding
work here at home.  Trade must work both ways.  AGOA has been
beneficial to the people of the continent of Africa and to the people
of the United States of America.  That's why this is a good piece of
legislation.</p>

<p> Since its enactment in 2000, AGOA has generated over $340 million
in investment and created thousands of jobs.  Things are happening
because of the law we're extending today, positive things for people in
Africa and in America.  The enactment of this law will help ensure that
this mutually beneficial trade continues.  Trade and investment from
around the world is essential to world peace.  The United States and
the nations of the sub-Saharan Africa are working together to break
down trade barriers around the world -- not just between ourselves, but
around the world.</p>

<p> My trade representative, Ambassador Bob Zoellick is in Africa right
now.  He's meeting with his counterparts from across the continent to
prepare for the World Trade Organization meeting in Geneva later this
month.  These are important meetings.  They're important meetings for
the people of the United States; they're important meetings for the
people on the continent of Africa.  And the reason why is because we
want to advance our shared economic agenda, and it's very important for
our AGOA partners to help make these talks in Geneva a success.  Pass
the word on to your capitals.</p>

<p> No region has more to gain from free markets than Africa -- that's
the message.  And no region has more to lose from a stalled WTO process
than Africa.  By working together and by our example, we can show the
world that a new global trade agreement can bring greater prosperity to
all nations.</p>

<p> Real prosperity is the work of many years.  I know that.  It's hard
work.  It's hard to change the status quo.  This law encourages the
change in the status quo.</p>

<p> I'm so pleased and proud to see the ambassadors from the African
nations who are here.  Thank you all for coming.  You've worked hard to
make AGOA a success.  You've worked hard to spread the message in the
halls of Congress, and your hard work has paid off.  I share your
optimism about Africa's future.  That's what we believe.  Those of us
who are standing up here believe in the future of Africa.  We
appreciate the commitment to freedom.  We appreciate your understanding
that we all have an obligation to spread opportunity throughout all
corners of this important part of the world.</p>

<p> And now, it is my honor to sign this important piece of
legislation. </p>
