It turns out the only two times           we&#146;ve gotten any real snow this winter have been the days book           club was scheduled. We&#146;ll, we&#146;ve decided to give this book           one more chance.

The author of the 1981           book &quot;Industrial Design&quot; (an essential item on every self-respecting           industrial designer's bookshelf) he now succeeds to define industrial           design by reflecting it against modern contexts such as cultural, technological,           environmental and corporate influences.</p>        <p>&quot;Design is one of the basic characteristics of what it is to be           human, and an essential determinant of the quality of human life.&quot;           - a principle that nurtures his book as much as our profession.</p>        <p>If you don't make it there, then book is also available on-line at           Amazon:<br>          <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/detail/-/books/0192803212/reviews/103-5395707-6548649#01928032125000">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/detail/-/books/0192803212/reviews/103-5395707-6548649#01928032125000</a></p>        <p><b><br>          IDSA Modelmaking Workshop: &quot;Model Thoughts&quot;<br>          </b>Hosted by Tim Copeland, IDSA, Podd Morrow Design<br>          Columbia College<br>          Thursday March 27th- 6:30-8:30 pm.<br>          623 S.

Paul Hatch: &quot;We found           that the chief attraction of the Book Club is the social aspect of the           meeting, which typically only briefly focuses on the chosen book. Discourse           then ran the full gambit of topics.&quot;</p>        <p>Fight Club is a more targeted discussion, around a chosen topic of           debate such as a film, TV show or current exhibition. The first meeting           will be centered on the film Matrix Reloaded. Here, two volunteers will           take extreme pro and contra angles to debate the merits and pitfalls           of the film, the actors, and the genre. Everyone else can add their           spice to the debate on either side. </p>        <p>First Rule of Fight Club: There are no debating rules.<br>          Second Rule of Fight Club: There can only be one winner.</p>        <p>Being able to articulate and defend your opinion is one of the most<br>          important skills a designer could have, and one that is rarely taught           in school. Join us on June 26 for the very first IDSA verbal slugfest.</p>        <p><br>          <strong>Battle of the Bands<br>          </strong>July 9<br>          6:30 pm refreshments<br>          7:00 pm discussion</p>        <p>SRAM Corporation<br>          1333 North Kingsbury<br>          Chicago, IL 60622<br>          312.664.8800<br>          <a href="http://www.sram.com/">www.sram.com</a></p>        <p>Come see how local designers use their 3D software.
