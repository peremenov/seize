              for the books she wrote and edited for children and younger 
              readers. She was editor-in-chief of the Junior Literary Guild from 
              1929 until her retirement in 1959. Helen J. Ferris' first 
              publication appeared in the Wisconsin Audubon Magazine when she 
              was eleven. From 1912 to 1919, she held a number of editorial 
              positions including The Guardian, American Girl, and Youth's 
              Companion. She also published her first four books - one of which 
              was the landmark manual for workers - Girls' Clubs.</i><p><i>Helen

        <h4><a name="need"></a>The need for a leader</h4>
        <p class="MsoNormal">[<span class="GramE"><i>page</i></span><i> 14</i>] 
        The necessity for having a Leader among any group of organized girls is 
        evident to all who have had experience with Girls’ Clubs. The younger 
        the <span class="GramE">girls, the greater becomes</span> this necessity 
        for the presence of an older person who can steady their impetuous 
        enthusiasm and tactfully guide their activities into useful channels. No 
        matter what the purpose of the Club is, the girls are coming together 
        because of some need in their lives. This need may be social or 
        educational in character. But, whatever it is, a Club Leader who is 
        far-seeing, wise in her judgments, and sympathetic, can introduce into 
        the Club activities the elements which will meet the needs of the Club 
        members. Often the girls but vaguely realize that there is a lack, in 
        their lives. It is part of the older Cub Leader’s task to discover it 
        and to meet it.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">The presence of a Club Leader gives to the 
        proceedings of the Club a stability which is most necessary. The mothers 
        of the girls are more willing to have their daughters attend the Club 
        meetings when they know that the Club is under wise supervision. If the 
        Club Leader is present at every meeting, on hand early to welcome all 
        comers, if she knows What must be accomplished and [<i>page 15</i>] by 
        her suggestions sees that the Club does not wander from its purpose — 
        she constitutes a help to any Club which it cannot afford to be without.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">When times of stress and disagreement enter into 
        the Club life, the Club members often look instinctively to a fair and 
        impartial Club Leader to make the necessary decision and to bring 
        harmony to the ranks once more. A wise and tactful leader can frequently 
        hold a Club together when, without her, the Club might have suddenly 
        ended its existence.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">The presence of a Leader is often necessary for the 
        constructive development of the Club. Many groups of girls have but few 
        ideas for the activities upon which their Clubs should enter. Given a 
        good suggestion from their leader, however, they are able to enlarge 
        upon it and add their own ideas. Other girls have suggestions which are 
        practicable for Club work only after they have been adapted to the 
        particular situation at hand. A farseeing Club Leader receives such 
        suggestions and tactfully modifies them for her particular Club. Such 
        functions of a Club Leader could scarcely be performed by one of the 
        girls themselves, for it is the more mature judgment of the leader which 
        enables her to meet and to solve the problems of Club life.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">To the uninitiated, it might seem a wise policy to 
        allow one of the Club members to assume these duties of Leader. Such a 
        course of action suggests greater opportunity in the development of 
        self-reliance. As a matter of fact, in most Girls’ Clubs the presence of 
        a Leader is needed in order to insure just this training to all Club 
        members alike. A Club of young girls without a Leader — a Leader who 
        insists that all her girls, whether [<i>page 16</i>] self-assertive or 
        retiring, share equally in the opportunities of the Club — will almost 
        inevitably see its affair, gradually drift into the control of a few 
        natural “leaders,” and its spirit of democracy lose force. A Club Leader 
        is needed among girls to see that the <span class="SpellE">honors</span> 
        and opportunities of Club life are distributed “share and’ share alike.” 
        Her presence should mean greater opportunities for her girls and, 
        because she is there, her Club should be a more helpful and happy one.</p>
        <h4><a name="who"></a>Who is to be leader?</h4>
        <p class="MsoNormal">This is the question which confronts many a Club 
        organizer as she thinks of a group of girls whom she would like to see 
        formed in a Club. <span class="GramE">For the majority of Girls’ Clubs 
        are formed at the instigation of some larger organization or because of 
        the interest of some social worker or other broad-minded person.</span> 
        The Head of a Settlement House gets acquainted with a few girls who are 
        interested in sewing She thinks it will be helpful to have them meet 
        together—and thus is born a Sewing Club. An extension Library worker 
        finds some girls who are interested in reading. She sends out 
        invitations for a “Book Party,” at the close of which she suggests that 
        they meet regularly to read and discuss what they have read. The idea is 
        enthusiastically received and a Girls’ Club is then under way. Or 
        perhaps a Y W C <span class="GramE">A</span> secretary finds a factory 
        where the lunch hour is sufficiently long for some activity. She obtains 
        permission to try out her plan and goes to the factory during the lunch 
        hour. The girls gather around her. She tells stories or amuses them 
        4.vith “stunts.” The girls show [<i>page 17</i>] their interest and she 
        asks them whether they wouldn’t enjoy coming together once a week. They 
        agree to do so — and another Girls’ Club has been organized. To be sure, 
        groups of girls do organize into Clubs without any outside suggestion. 
        Such groups sometimes apply for admission into a Settlement House 
        organization. They have been together in school and now they wish to 
        have a Club. In any case, the group of girls is there. They can be 
        organized. Now what about a Leader?</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">The obvious answer to this question seems to be, “a 
        woman.” And this answer comes naturally because women have successfully 
        held the leadership of the majority of Girls’ Clubs. Men have, at times, 
        wisely directed such organizations, especially when the Club has met for 
        some class work and the man in charge has been qualified to teach in 
        that definite work. But a woman seems especially fitted for Club 
        leadership because of her understanding of the problems which the girl 
        constantly meets. The Camp Fire Girls’ Manual outlines the 
        qualifications of a “Guardian” (as the Camp Fire Leaders are called) in 
        the following way: “Camp Fire Guardians are older women, who, because of 
        their larger experiences, are able to lead the girls into larger 
        interests. Mothers are urged to become Guardians, and the meetings are 
        usually held in the homes or out-of-doors.” <span class="GramE">If, 
        then, a woman is to be chosen as Leader of a proposed Girls’ Club, what 
        kind of woman is best qualified for the task?</span> Shall the organizer 
        search for a young woman, full of enthusiasm and energy, or for an older 
        woman, with the wisdom of judgment that comes with years? There can be 
        no fixed rule to follow. Girls’ Clubs have succeeded under the guidance 
        of [<i>page 18</i>] enthusiastic young women, full of the “stunts” which 
        girls enjoy. And they have been successful under older women who have 
        had the spirit of youth in their hearts. The kind of Leader desired 
        depends upon the situation at hand. The social worker hunts for a 
        volunteer worker. The employer searches for someone to employ. In either 
        case, the task is essentially the same. The social worker must find 
        someone who is willing to take up the task and who will be faithful to 
        her responsibilities. The employer must find a Club worker who is 
        primarily interested in the development of the girls, rather than in the 
        salary he will pay her for the work.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Each Club presents its special problems and often 
        the Leader should be definitely qualified to meet those problems. The 
        Leader of a Girls’ Canning Club in the country must understand the art 
        of canning and preserving. She will, whenever possible, introduce into 
        the Club life those social elements which mean so much to the lonely 
        country girl; but, first and foremost, the Club has been organized to 
        can. And the leader must therefore have this specific knowledge. The 
        leader of a Literary Club will of necessity have <span class="GramE">a 
        knowledge</span> of books. Her girls have formed a Literary Club because 
        of their interest in literature. Her own acquaintance with books will 
        enable her to suggest those books for study which will be definitely 
        helpful and inspiring to her particular group of girls. The Leader of a 
        Girls’ Club in a business house will grasp the various phases of the 
        business life in which the Club is to grow, and will plan her work to 
        appeal to and help girls who are in just that situation. The leader of a 
        group of foreign girls will find it helpful if she is able to speak 
        their [<i>page 19</i>] native language. This ability of hers is the door 
        through which she can lead them to an understanding of American life and 
        its ideals.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Not every Club requires such specific talents. Most 
        Girls’ Clubs, especially those among the younger girls, come together to 
        “have a Club.” They wish to do many kinds of things in their hours 
        together—singing playing, dancing and whatever else appeals to them. In 
        the majority of Clubs, in settlement houses, in <span class="SpellE">
        Y.W.C.A.’s</span> and in churches, the demand is for a general Club 
        Leader, one who can rally the girls, interest them in the activities of 
        the Club and carry those activities to a successful conclusion. It is 
        always of great help, however, in planning the work of any Club, to know 
        at the outset what the prospective Leader is able to do in any special 
        line. The Settlement or Guild director can then often suggest certain 
        activities when she knows that the Leader is qualified to carry them on. 
        The Club Leader herself does not always realize that her talents can be 
        of practical use, until the questioning of the organizer brings the 
        matter to her attention and points out the possibilities. This search 
        for some talents often reveals others which are equally useful, and the 
        Club Leader comes to realize this important fact—that Girls’ Club work 
        is wide in its possibilities and its requirements, and that—whatever she 
        herself can do well—this very training can be passed on to her girls.</p>
        <h4><a name="qualities"></a>Special qualifications to be sought</h4>
        <p class="MsoNormal">The following questions show the points concerning 
        prospective Club Leaders which an organizer of girls has considered 
        important in her own selection of them.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">[<span class="GramE"><i>page</i></span><i> 20</i>]</p>
        <h5>Choosing the Club Leader</h5>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span class="GramE"><i>Her appearance and 
        personality</i>.</span> Is she neat and attractive appearance? Is her 
        personality, winning?</p>
        <h5>Her Training</h5>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span class="GramE"><i>Education</i>.</span> What 
        has been her education? If at a college or other advanced school, in. 
        what did’ she specialize? What did she most enjoy? Was .she active in 
        any non-academic interests? If so, which were they? Did she hold any 
        offices or serve on any committees?</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span class="GramE"><i>Special Talents</i>.</span> 
        Has she any special talents? Is she musical? Can she coach plays? Can 
        she direct athletics? Teach dancing? Can she teach cooking? Can she 
        teach sewing? Art embroidery? Crochet or knitting? Can she teach any 
        special arts, such as weaving? Does she enjoy books and reading?</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span class="GramE"><i>Previous Experience</i>.</span> 
        Has she held any position, volunteer or paid, previously to this?
        <span class="GramE">If so, what?</span> <span class="GramE">For how 
        long?</span> Why did she leave? Has she ever done work of this kind 
        before? <span class="GramE">‘Where?</span> What was the extent of it? 
        Who were the girls with whom she dealt? What were the activities of the 
        Club? Did she enjoy it? If she has never been active in Club work 
        before, bow did she <span class="GramE">become</span> interested in it? 
        How much time can she give to it? What are her ideas about the 
        conducting of a Club?</p>
        <h4><a name="where"></a>Where are leaders found?</h4>
        <p class="MsoNormal">The heads of our large social organizations 
        naturally look to our educated young women for service as Club Leaders. 
        They have enjoyed advantages for which many of these Club girls yearn, 
        or, perhaps, to which they are looking forward. To those who will never 
        be able to enjoy them, the college or school girl can bring something of 
        the happiness and of the lessons of school days. To those who will some 
        day be college girls themselves, the Club Leader can bring—through 
        their’ Club team [<i>page 21</i>] work—some elements of preparation 
        which are not to be found in the pages of the Latin grammar. In Hull 
        House, the evening social Clubs (self-governing groups of young people) 
        organize and meet under the direction of Leaders appointed by the Social 
        Clubs Committee. These Leaders are drawn from the Recreation Department 
        of the Chicago School of Civics and. Philanthropy and are
        <span class="GramE">students</span> in. training. Such a plan is of 
        great advantage both to the Clubs and to the Leaders. The Clubs enjoy 
        the leadership of trained and vitally interested workers, and the 
        Leaders enjoy the opportunity of contact with a Club, while they are 
        studying to be recreational directors.</p>
        <h4><a name="qualification"></a><a name="_General_qualifications"></a>
        General qualifications</h4>
        <p class="MsoNormal">But such specially trained young people are not 
        always available. Many of our smaller and country communities have no 
        specially educated women upon whom they may call for Club leadership. 
        This should not mean that a Club cannot be started in these places. 
        There can always be found a club Leader for the girls, if careful search 
        is made. Many a mother has been found who has welcomed such an 
        opportunity to meet with her daughter and her daughter’s friends and to 
        be “chums” with them. Often school teachers have been persuaded to 
        undertake the work; they have been glad to meet the girls in an informal 
        way and to put aside the relationship of being the “teacher.” The Camp 
        Fire Manual suggests these points in the selection of a Leader. 
        “Guardians should be appointed from among those (1) who personally know 
        the families of the girls; (2) with whom the parents will cooperate.” If 
        a woman [<i>page 21</i>] is vitally interested in the girls, open to 
        suggestions, and eager to develop her Club, that Club Leader will render 
        a service to the Community through the organization which she is 
        helping.</p>
        <h4><a name="requisite"></a>A fundamental requisite</h4>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Club Leaders of many years’ experience often 
        realize that, while the question of one’s talents and specific abilities 
        is apt to be a first consideration, it is, in fact, secondary to 
        another. Without this other, the most brilliantly talented Club Leaders 
        have failed in their efforts. With it, those coming to their Clubs with 
        apparently empty hands have made of their Clubs vital organizations. 
        This primary consideration is the spirit of the Leader. To have the Club 
        do its most effective work, the leader must be wholeheartedly interested 
        in its members and their development. Real interest in the girls means 
        interest not merely in their meetings of one or two hours a week or a 
        month. The influence of the best Club Leader extends far beyond these 
        comparatively short periods of their being together in the Club, out 
        into the lives, of the girls, whether at home, at work, or in school. 
        She gets intimately acquainted with them and knows their family life, 
        their problems, and their interests. No matter who or where the girl is, 
        of what age or nationality, she will respond to real interest and will 
        instinctively go for advice to her who she, feels is her real friend.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">“Do not go to your girls with any feeling of 
        superiority,” a successful Club worker once said to a new Club Leader, 
        “and don’t feel rather satisfied to think you are doing a truly good 
        deed. They will feel your superiority [<i>page 23</i>] and will resent 
        it. Instead, go to them as you would to a group of people whom you have 
        wished for a long time to meet, and as friend to friend get acquainted.” 
        This key word “As friend to friend” is one which the new Club Leader may 
        well ‘remember throughout her Club work.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">A small, unattractive woman once approached a 
        Superintendent in a city Sunday <span class="GramE">School</span> and 
        asked whether she might take a class of young women. Thinking her 
        services would be of no special value, he gave her a class of three. In 
        the course of a year, the class had grown to seven. Two years passed and 
        fourteen were in the class. The quiet woman had formed a Girls’ Club 
        which met regularly at her house. She had called in the homes of the 
        girls and had come to know their families. She remembered their 
        birthdays with cards and went to see them when they were sick. She gave 
        parties for them to which they were sometimes invited to bring young 
        men. She could not direct plays or get up a Glee Club, and yet when her 
        girls wished to do those things, they had little difficulty in finding 
        someone who was willing to help them in that special line. Such 
        instances as this encourage tentative Club Leaders who perhaps feel that 
        they have not sufficient ability for Club work. A true, wholesome friend 
        is what every girl needs and it is possible for an earnest, interested 
        worker to give and to win friendship of this kind.</p>
        <h4><a name="desirable"></a>Other desirable characteristics</h4>
        <p class="MsoNormal">To name all the personal characteristics desirable 
        in a Club Leader would be to describe a combination of [<i>page 24</i>] 
        them which is rarely, if ever, found in one worker. A few, however, 
        stand out as especially helpful in Club work and surely not 
        unattainable.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><i>Faithfulness</i>—how often has the lack of it on 
        the part of her volunteer workers brought despair to the heart of a 
        Y.W.C.A. director! And, on the contrary, how often has she blessed the 
        Club Leader who is always present at meetings, always on time, and who 
        has always made the plans for which she said she would be responsible! 
        The best Club Leader places faithfulness to her word before her own 
        personal pleasure, and her influence upon the girls is strong or weak 
        according as she considers her Club important or unimportant. One Club 
        Leader once wrote a pledge which, in her opinion, was the most important 
        for a worker among girls to observe. The pledge was as follows: “I will 
        always keep my promises to my girls, unless some real reason prevents. 
        By real reason, I do not mean an attractive social engagement.”</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><i>Ability to be fair and to treat all Club members 
        impartially</i> is also desirable in a Club Leader. It is difficult to 
        be constantly impartial when some of the girls seem so responsive and so 
        well worth the effort expended upon them, while others are far from 
        being attractive and are coldly indifferent. Unless a Club Leader is on 
        her guard, she will quite naturally fall into the habit of referring to 
        one or two Club girls as ideal Club members, and before she knows it, 
        the rest of the Club will charge her with having “pets.” Those who have 
        had little interest before will seize upon this as an excuse for their 
        indifference. One Club Leader found her work made suddenly difficult 
        because she had held up a certain few girls as [<i>page 25</i>] a 
        constant example before the others. This aroused resentment in the Club 
        against the good workers and against her. She had, to be sure,
        <span class="SpellE">honored</span> those who most deserved it, but she 
        afterward said that had she realized the consequences of her action, she 
        would not have been so’ emphatic about the excellence of the few and 
        would have worked more intensively with the others to bring them up to 
        the high standard.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">The necessity for maintaining wholesome friendships 
        is closely allied to this ability to treat all with impartiality. Any 
        who have dealt with girls know what a “crush,” or passionate 
        hero-worship, is; and have come to dread its appearance as destructive 
        to team work and Club cooperation. Incipient hero-worship is but natural 
        in girls. They are at the hero-worshiping age. The wise Club Leader will 
        not shun nor treat with disdain the young ‘girl who dogs her footsteps. 
        Rather, she will make of it the opportunity for developing a real and 
        vital friendship. And by showing an attitude of simple cordiality and 
        dispassionate interest, she will almost invariably be able to win a 
        steady loyalty quite different from flaming and fluctuating adoration, 
        and far more lasting. A director of many Girls’ Clubs once pointed with 
        pride to the fact that this spirit of passion was lacking in all of her 
        organization. “Some people will tell you that it is impossible to carry 
        on Girls’ Club work without it,” she remarked, “but it is possible and 
        we know it because we have done it. To be sure, we have had a policy of 
        aiming at wholesome friendships and have kept it constantly before us. 
        More than this, we have <span class="SpellE">endeavored</span> to have 
        our own friendships for each [<i>page 26</i>] other on the high plane of 
        balance and sanity. All of this has helped and we are proud of the 
        result.”</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><i>Power to see things in the same way as her girls</i> 
        is of greatest value to the Club Leader. When she knows their home life 
        and their training, or lack of it, there comes to her an understanding 
        of their actions. “Before I give any advice, I always try to put myself 
        in the girl’s place,” one Club Leader has said. “It’s surprising bow 
        often this changes what I had meant to say<span class="GramE">!“</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Lack of this very ability to put herself in the 
        girl’s place has brought misunderstanding and even failure into the life 
        of many a Leader. A Club Leader in a business house once decided to 
        organize a Club among some young girls to meet during the lunch hour. 
        The girls were interested in dancing, so she taught them simple folk 
        dances. At the outset, she had had in mind the conducting of a class 
        like the Physical Training classes she had conducted in her gymnasium. 
        She soon found that she could not do it in that way. At first she was 
        inclined to reprimand the girls for getting out of line and for 
        giggling, but when she stopped to consider the fact that lunch time was 
        their only free hour during the day, she soon lost all desire to see 
        them standing in rows,’ learning steps the entire time. So there was no 
        reprimand for the girls who laughed heartily at their own efforts to do 
        the dances. She provided songs and games for part of the half-hour with 
        the result that when the time came for the dance work, the girls 
        invariably gave earnest attention to it. The result of this policy on 
        her part was the creation of an atmosphere of sociability and enjoyment 
        rather than of work to be done. [<span class="GramE"><i>page</i></span><i> 
        27</i>]</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">A visiting Club Leader complained of her inability 
        to hold her girls during lunch hour in a similar Club. The first leader 
        visited the other’s rooms and talked with the girls.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">“She makes us work all the time on those dances,” 
        objected one, “and she says we’re silly when we laugh. How would you 
        like to work all day and never laugh even on your lunch hour<span class="GramE">?“</span> 
        The second Club Leader could not have made this mistake bad she been 
        able to sympathetically put herself in the place of her Club members.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span class="GramE"><i>Self-Control</i>.</span> 
        Perplexing situations are sure to arise in the life of a Club, such as 
        try the Leader’s patience to the utmost. If, through them all, she is 
        able to preserve her self-control, she will have contributed vitally to 
        the development of her girls, who are often sadly in need of that very 
        self-control. The force of a good example is perhaps never exerted more 
        powerfully’ than in showing control of one’s temper when the Club work 
        is difficult. “She never gets mad when you’re bad,” said one girl of a 
        beloved Camp Director, “but she makes you feel pretty mean when you 
        break rules, because she’s always so sorry about it!”</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">And so it would be possible to make a long list of 
        personal characteristics which enable a Club Leader to exert a helpful 
        influence upon her girls. Perhaps the best general rule for the Leader 
        is to always try to be what she wishes her girls to be. If her ideal is 
        sufficiently high, she will never attain it. But in the striving, she 
        will help not only her girls but also herself, immeasurably. [<span class="GramE"><i>page</i></span><i> 
        28</i>]</p>
        <h4><a name="acquanited"></a>Getting acquainted with the girls</h4>
        <p class="MsoNormal">The earnest Club Leader will at once set about 
        getting acquainted with her girls in as vital a way as possible. She has 
        been given a group of girls to lead along the lines of useful 
        development. The activities of the Club and her personal relationship 
        with them must further this aim. In order to accomplish this, she must 
        know each girl. Her help can then be given wisely. But such acquaintance 
        cannot be gained, at once, nor without definitely searching for it. For 
        “knowing each girl” means far more than being able to recognize her upon 
        the street and calling her by name. It includes acquaintance with her 
        family and her home life, her education, her surroundings, her 
        interests—in short, an acquaintance with the forces which have made her 
        what she is. If, a Leader has definitely in mind what she wishes to, 
        know about her girls, any conversation will give her an opportunity to 
        learn the desired facts. It may be some time before the Leader knows all 
        that she wishes concerning her girls. Many Club Leaders have found it 
        far wiser to approach the girls gradually than to go to them in the 
        attitude of a cross-questioner and by constant questioning to arouse 
        their suspicions and antagonism. A friend, however, confides in a 
        friend. Once a Club Leader has proved herself a friend to her girls, 
        girlish confidences follow and the Leader is in a position to advise and 
        direct wisely.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Just what it is helpful to know about a group of 
        girls varies with the ‘kind of girls who are members of the group. The 
        following list of questions, however, includes many of the necessary 
        facts and may be a guide [<i>page 29</i>] to Club Leaders in making a 
        fundamental acquaintance with their girls. Miss Mary Richmond’s book on 
        “Social Diagnosis” (Russell Sage Foundation, Publishers) also gives au 
        excellent set of questionnaires which fit situations of all kinds.</p>

        <h4><a name="community"></a>Know your community</h4>
        <p class="MsoNormal">From the outset, the progressive Club Leader will 
        realize that her Club is not the only force which touches the lives of 
        her girls. The Club meets for one or two hours every week or two weeks. 
        Think of the many other hours during each week when other forces, for 
        good and for evil, are touching those same lives! “What are they? How 
        can I work with them, and in this way establish more firmly the work of 
        my own Club<span class="GramE">?“</span> These are the questions which 
        come before every Club Leader. Often they present themselves through the 
        desires or needs of the girls. One of the Club girls wishes to join a 
        church. What is the best one for her, in the section where she lives? A 
        Club member is eager to study stenography and typewriting. Where is the 
        most thorough course given, and at what price? The father of one of the 
        Club girls is living a life harmful to the best interests of the family. 
        What organization should she consult for help? The Club wishes to give 
        some financial help to some good cause in the community. What shall it 
        be? Such questions as these arise constantly in a growing Girls’ Club. 
        The alert Club Leader who knows the organizations and opportunities of 
        her own district or town is able to answer them with practical, definite 
        suggestions, which the girls can put into action. Margaret F.
        <span class="SpellE">Byington</span> in her booklet on “What Social 
        Workers Should Know about Their Own Communities,” has said of her 
        suggestions: “This is not a plan for a Social Survey; it is rather an 
        outline of those facts about local conditions which are a necessary part 
        of the equipment for service of the volunteer or [<i>page 32</i>] of the 
        regular in the social army. In fulfilling his task, whatever it may be, 
        every such worker must rely for help on the organized forces, on State 
        laws and local ordinances, on city, departments and volunteer agencies. 
        He will, moreover, find his problem so dovetailed with other problems 
        that all must be worked out jointly if anything is to be achieved.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;“The knowledge of these forces and agencies is of 
        special importance to one who works among needy families, since he must 
        utilize them constantly in the rehabilitation of individual families. 
        Conversely, he should learn from the study of dependency in these 
        families what reforms are most needed, and help to focus the efforts of 
        all agencies with a social program on the removal of evils thus made 
        real to him.”</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;The general outline of Miss <span class="SpellE">
        Byington’s</span> suggestions concerning facts which the Club worker may

        <p class="MsoNormal">Many interested in the girl-problem have given this 
        matter of community organization special study and have compiled 
        outlines of definite help to workers with girls. In Columbus, Ohio, 
        through the officers of the Girls’ Friendly Society, a survey was 
        compiled of opportunities for girls in’ that city. The list included 
        opportunities for education, employment, amusement, protection,
        <span class="SpellE">labor</span> laws, legal aid, lodgings, lunch 
        rooms, savings, settlements and churches.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">The Young Women’s Christian Association, in its 
        pamphlet on “Some Resources for Work with Girls and Young Women in 
        Towns,” places such a survey as an important part of girls’ work. This 
        pamphlet states: “The purpose of a survey is not for prying, but for a 
        definite focus on facts, ‘getting one’s range,’ so that there shall be
        <span class="GramE">neither haziness</span> of aim nor waste of energy. 
        Each place is a different puzzle, and the life and ambitions of girls 
        are always more or less <span class="SpellE">colored</span> by the 
        influence peculiar to each locality, so that one must never generalize.”</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">The outline suggested in this pamphlet is as 
        follows:</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><b><i>Sources of Information for the Survey</i></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">1. Direct conversation with girls and young women.</p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">4. Study of methods and successes and failures of 
        other town organizations.</p>

        to women. Number of women employed outside of their homes. State how

        clubs, indicating whether their purpose is literary, social, civic,
        <span class="GramE">philanthropic</span>, telling the name of the 
        president and the number of members. Make separate lists of lodges and 
        also of church organizations. How many of these organizations have in 
        their membership girls between 55 and 25? What organizations, if any, 
        are there whose membership is made up exclusively of girls?</p>

        not go on to High School? How many girls from the High School have gone 
        to college in the last three years? What determined the others not to 
        go? What work have they taken up? (Consult the school superintendent or 
        High School principal in getting these figures.) Is there a library in 
        town? How many volumes? Open how much of the time? Does the town have a

        active young people’s organizations? Is there a city union of young 
        people or any other interdenominational plan for working together?</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">A large, general survey of this kind, while 
        suggestive for the individual Club Leader, is much <span class="GramE">
        more broad</span> in scope than she may wish to undertake. Miss Eliza R. 
        Butler, in connection with the problems of Secondary School girl work, 
        has formulated an outline for a survey in that field which shows how the 
        idea of a survey can be adapted to special problems. The following 
        points are included in Miss Butler’s outline:</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">1. Study of the nature and interests of girlhood.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">2. Social programs—to determine the amount of time 
        available for Club activities.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">3. School regulations in regard to student 
        activities and organizations.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">4. State laws and ordinances concerning the use of 
        public school buildings, etc.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><span class="GramE">5. The problems of school life’ 
        in the given school or group of schools.</span></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">(a) Percentage of graduates going to college.</p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">(d) Existence of other clubs and organizations 
        which- ma~ be meeting student needs. [<span class="GramE"><i>page</i></span><i> 
        36</i>]</p>
        <h4><a name="contact"></a>Contact with other leaders of girls</h4>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Perhaps nothing is of more inspirational help to a 
        Club Leader than meeting others who are also interested in girls and who 
        are dealing with the same problems. Great benefit is to be gained from 
        such personal contact and from informal discussion of these problems. 
        Those who direct large organizations made up of many Clubs have long 
        since realized the importance of gathering Club Leaders together. And so 
        it is that we see the Club Leaders of a Settlement House meeting to 
        discuss their plans; the Secretaries and the volunteer workers in a Y. 
        W. C. A. coming together; we hear of Camp Fire Guardians or Girl Scout 
        Captains conferring in special sessions. In many parts of the United 
        States such gatherings are not limited to single organizations. Groups 
        of leaders have been formed that are city-wide, county-wide, and even 
        country-wide.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">In Philadelphia the leaders of girls in that city 
        are united in the Girls’ Conference. All organizations interested in 
        work for girls are invited to join. The conference is an open forum for 
        the discussion of city-girl problems. Four or more meetings are held in 
        the course of the year, and the problems are then presented and 
        discussed. The roll of the Girls’ Conference includes organizations of 
        all kinds—religious (Jewish, Catholic, and Protestant); remedial 
        organizations; educational organizations; and recreational 
        organizations. The executive board of this Conference includes a Girls’ 
        High School principal, representatives from the Catholic, Jewish, and
        <span class="SpellE">Colored</span>, organizations of the city, and 
        representatives from such organizations as the <span class="GramE">
        Salvation &nbsp;[</span><i>page 37</i>] Army, the Y. W. C. A., the Girls’ Aid 
        Society, and the <span class="SpellE">Travelers</span>’ Aid Society. A 
        meeting of a committee of this kind gives many points of view concerning 
        the girls of the community. The following subjects which the 
        Philadelphia Girls’ Conference has considered show the practical 
        problems which have come before them: “Closer cooperation of all field 
        workers”; “Vocational training and guidance and follow-up work of girls 
        obtaining working papers, with special attention to recreation and 
        character building”; “Social Service for cases heard in Magistrates’ 
        Court”; “Work with girls and women in War Times”; “Constructive War Work 
        with girls,” and “Recreation of women affected by War-Time Activities.”</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">In smaller communities, it is possible to bring 
        together the school teachers and the Sunday- School teachers as well as 
        those directly concerned with Club work. The Boys’ and Girls’ 
        Agricultural Clubs, which have been largely promoted under the auspices 
        of the United States Government, have used the county as a unit, and 
        within a county have brought the Clubs and Club Leaders into personal 
        touch with one another. In this way there has been created a cordial 
        friendliness and cooperation.</p>
        <h4><a name="training"></a>Training for the new club leader</h4>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Contact with experienced Club Leaders is especially 
        valuable to the new and inexperienced Leader. Many young women just 
        starting out upon this work have received valuable suggestions by 
        talking with those who have for years been interested in this line. 
        Those who are in charge of many Clubs and of Club Leaders have prepared 
        for these Leaders short courses to be <span class="GramE">given &nbsp;[</span><i>page 
        38</i>] at summer conferences or winter meetings. The
        <span class="SpellE">foTlowing</span> course for Leaders was given under 
        the Girls’ Division of the National Service Commission, New York City, 
        in the form of six lectures by women of experience in girls’ work:</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal"><b><i>A. The Club and its Organization.</i></b></p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">1. How best to reach the girls.</p>

        have been found to be successful for girls, such as,</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">a.&nbsp;Girl Scout Work.</p>

        <p class="MsoNormal">5. Forum meeting for Questions and Discussions.</p>
        <h4><a name="publications"></a>Contact with club leaders through 
        publications</h4>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Many books have been written which touch upon the 
        various phases of Girls’ Club work, and the periodicals which are 
        published by the various organizations give to every Club Leader a 
        splendid opportunity for gathering new ideas for her Club. The Camp Fire 
        Girls’ Handbook (fifty cents); the Handbook for Girl Scouts (thirty 
        cents); the Woodcraft Manual for Girls of the Woodcraft League (fifty 
        cents)—all of these outline in greatest detail many activities for 
        girls. The monthly publications of the large organizations of girls and 
        young women give many suggestions for the actual carrying out of these 
        activities. There is no issue of the following Girls’ - Club magazines 
        which does not contain definite suggestions for Club work, either in the 
        special articles written by trained Club workers, or in the reports 
        which the girls themselves contribute. Any Girls’ Club Leader will find 
        help in the “Association Monthly” (Y. W. C. A. publication, one dollar a 
        year); “<span class="SpellE">Wohelo</span>” (Camp Fire Girls’ Magazine, 
        one dollar a year); “The Rally” (Girl Scouts’ Magazine, one dollar a 
        year); “The Club Worker” (published by the National League of Women 
        Workers, thirty cents a year). By subscribing to one or all of these 
        publications any Club Leader can, at <span class="GramE">a &nbsp;[</span><i>page 
        40</i>] small expense, receive a constant influx of new ideas. It 
        matters little whether or not she has a group of girls under any of 
        these particular organizations; there is suggestion and inspiration for 
        her in all work which is being carried on among girls.</p>
        <h4><a name="copperation"></a>Cooperation with other individuals</h4>
        <p class="MsoNormal">Many Club Leaders have found that there are others 
        living in the same community who are willing to help in the work of 
        their Clubs. These others are not willing to undertake the work of a 
        Club, but they are glad to give their help in coaching a play, in 
        training a Glee Club for a certain concert, or in arranging for a 
        special outing. The Club Leader who makes use of not only her own 
        talents but also those of her friends finds help waiting for her where 
        she may least expect it.</p>
        <p class="MsoNormal">One Club Leader in a large city successfully 
        introduced the “Big Sister” idea into her Club work. Her girls were of a 
        kind who needed a large amount of individual attention. She herself was 
        unable to give it. So she sought the help of a number of her friends, 
        asking each one to take one girl in the Club and be her “big Sister,” 
        taking her out to wholesome pleasures, watching her, and advising her. 
        The plan was well worth the effort, and the girls profited by these 
        helpful friendships.</p>
        <h4><a name="the_new_club_leader"></a>The new club leader</h4>
        <p class="MsoNormal">The numerous possibilities in Girls’ Club work 
        should cause no young woman who is genuinely interested in it to 
        hesitate in undertaking it <span class="GramE">There</span> is help for 
        her at every turn, through these many and various channels. She may feel 
        that her talents are <span class="SpellE">meager</span> and that she is 
        not well-equipped. But as her Club grows and develops, she, too, will 
        grow and develop. The girls themselves and those ready and anxious to 
        help her will teach her. As Dr. Luther H. <span class="SpellE">Gulick</span>, 
        President of the Camp Fire Girls, has said, “The paradox of life is that 
        we keep that part of it which we give to others and that we lose that 
        which we save for ourselves. The <span class="GramE">breath of the 
        Spirit is like the breeze—grasp</span> it to hold and there is nothing. 
        It is like the heart which grows by giving love. Without love, save it, 
        and the heart <span class="GramE">is</span> empty.”</div>
