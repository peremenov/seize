<p align=left><b>Updated 7/06 [F 42]</b>  I like intercourse, but I don't recEive very much sensation that way.   Position, size and how turned on I am beforehand make no difference to me either.  To me it's just another way to get my husband off -- I'm just as happy to go down on him, really!  I've tried masturbating during the act, and some men I've been with before I got married have tried doing it for me, but that doesn't work for me.  With all the movement going on, I can't focus on the sensation there or even feel it at all, especially if I'm on top.  In that position, I have to concentrate on the job (thrusting) and putting on the show (men need that visual stimulation!) and the verbal part (urging him on, go team!)  It's exciting, like a long passionate kiss, but nothing more.  I do love seeing my husband have a great time though!  If only I could get my clit surgically moved to my vaginal entrance where it would do me so much more good.

<p align=left><b>updated 3/05 [F] </b>First of all though, I think it is worth saying that the clitoris that most people refer to is actually just the tip of the clitoris. The full clitoris is in two halves which run down the sides of the vagina, just under the skin, like threads. They join together somewhere near the pelvic bone and then turn around through almost 360 degrees and emerge as the clitoral tip, just under the hood. For me, the two threads seem to be between the inner and outer lips. If you look far enough on the web you can get much more info on this - it is worthwhile knowing about it. 
<br>The point is that thrusting will usually stimulate these two threads depending on your position. For me, they seem to get rolled around under the skin as my husband thrusts in and out. If my legs are wide open, the stimulation is not very great but if I have my legs together with a pillow under my hips, as one lady indicated below, then there is a lot of stimulation.. In this position my husband usually seems to ride over the tip of my clit as he thrusts and so that gets stimulated as well. It’s a position I really like and can get me to a climax, with one proviso (see below). I should add that in this position I can very easily get sore around the tip of my clit because there is so much contact. We use a lot of baby oil around there, which prevents the problem. 
<br>The position that works best is for me to sit on the dressing table with some pillows behind me and lots under me so that I am at the right height. I can sit back and open my legs and my husband can get into me whilst supporting my thighs. The advantage of this is that my husband can thrust from a standing position and that means it is easier for him to thrust hard and fast. Also, and this is important, the angle is just right. If we’ve spent a lot of time on foreplay and I am very aroused then in this position the thrusting will easily get me to a climax. In fact, when it’s like this I don’t want him to go slow at all because that seems to calm me down too much. I would much rather he entered and started to thrust hard from the outset. 
<br>I think the two things which are vital for me to climax with thrusting are the stiffness of his penis which, with the help of Cialis, is very stiff(!!) and the speed and force of the thrusting. It really does have to be very hard and very fast whatever the position we are in. I suppose you also need a dressing table which is pretty solid and a guy that is in good shape! 


<p align=left><b>Updated 2/05 [M 58] </b> I'm 58, and years ago I decided to read all I could find on what women had to say about the topic of love and sex. Believe me, it was worth the effort. 
<br>Experience has taught me to arouse the woman thoroughly before intromission. Moreover, fully open her labia so that her clitoris exposed to the male's pelvis and pubic hair. And "grind" against her vulva, first in a clockwise motion, then counterclockwise. 
<br>Most importantly, communicate. Tell her how beautiful she is. Look her directly in the eyes during intercourse, kiss her and let her know just how wonderful sharing the experience makes you feel. 
<br>Almost certainly she will climax. 
<br>Stay in her after climax, telling her that you don't want to withdraw; that you want to "soak" and savor her essence. 
<br>My experience indicates that she will desire you more 

<p align=left><b>Updated 1/05 [F] </b> I guess I am kind of odd in that the thrusting doesn't do much for me.  It's almost like there is too much going on down there.  In fact, when I masturbate with a toy, I never thrust with it.  I find the feeling of being filled while my clitoris is stimulated much more exciting.

<p align=left><b>Updated 11/04 [F 35] </b>I can climax with thrusting alone, especially if I'm on top.  I've pretty much always been this way.  I think what gets me off is the rubbing motion more so than the thrusting though.  I agree with the previous post that there is quite 
a bit of clitoral contact on the partner's pelvic bone in the positions that 
work for me.  I could pretty much rub up against anything and get off (which 
is nice!)  I don't know if this is related, but like the other woman who 
posted, I too am able to have multiple orgasms...as many as I have the energy 
to go for.  

<p align=left><b>[M] </b>We actually never thought it was possible for my wife to cum through
thrusting alone.  Her orgasms had always required clitoral stimulation.  She
easily reached climax during penetration (from me, a vibrator or a dildo),
but only when either she or I fingered her clitoris, we used a vibrator on
her clitoris, or I gave her oral during dildo penetration.   Her first
climax from penetration alone came during a love making session where I
introduced her to an above average sized dildo.  I had visited a local
"porn" store to purchase some videos and stopped by the toy section to see
if there was anything new or different we might like to try.  The only thing
that caught my eye was a half dozen or so larger than life dildos.  I spent
some time obsessing over which size she might be able to accommodate, then
made a purchase of an 8" life like model with a fairly good sized girth.
Some were so large I questioned whether any woman could truly accommodate
them.  Anyway, with videos and a new toy in hand I went home for dinner and
what I hoped would be a fun night of sexual adventure.  As we watched one of
the videos and toyed a little with one of my wife's current dildos, I
introduced her to my new purchase.  Albeit it larger than any dildo or
vibrator she currently had tried, and larger than my cock, she was excited
enough from the video and our foreplay to give it a try.  We put a
lubricated condom over it and she lubricated her pussy (in and out) with a
good amount of KY in anticipation of a potentially difficult penetration.
As I watched, she pushed the dildo in slowly, inserting it in very small
increments.  
<br>After 4 or 5 inches were comfortably inside her she began to
carefully slide the dildo in and out in a fucking motion, each thrust
pushing it into her pussy just slightly deeper.  It took her quite some
time, many adjustments of her hips, a pillow under her ass, and a wider
spreading of her legs before she could manage a full penetration.  Once she
had it deeply in her pussy, she took a short break to catch her breath.  She
told me at the time that she felt that her pussy was completely stretched to
it's limit around the dildo.  As best she could, she slowly began fucking
her pussy as I sat there watching in amazement and excitement.  It wasn't
long before her strokes got longer and faster.  With one hand clutching the
sheets beneath her and the other holding the base of the dildo, she fucked
herself into an incredible frenzy.  Watching her orgasm like this was
without doubt the most exciting sexual act I had witnessed to date.  As she
came, she could barely keep her ass on the bed, her legs were flying about
and she screamed as if her life depended upon it.  When she finished cumming
and after many minutes of rest, she carefully and slowly pulled the dildo
from her pussy.  Many times that evening and into the next day she continued
to talk about the intensity of her orgasm and that this was the "first" time
ever that she had climaxed vaginally, with no clitoral stimulation.  From
that night on, her orgasms have been a mix of clitoral and vaginal climaxes
depending upon her desires and our sexual play.  She soon was able to orgasm
from my thrusting alone when we fucked and always during any dildo
penetration.

<p align=left><b>Updated 10/04 [M] </b>I am married to a really gorgeous lady who is very capable of doing this.
<br>I am no monster penis person; average is about where I stand in this regard. So it can’t be due to my size. Of course I could get all modest and say it is probably my technique!
<br>She interestingly does not like too much clitoral stimulation; in fact, I don’t think that I have ever made her climax clitorally. I know she is not into masturbating much if at all. She does not get very wet before sex but as soon as I am in her she seems to melt.
<br>Depending on how worked up she is she can orgasm in about 30 seconds and if I continue with a certain angle she has huge, long orgasms. She likes to be on top with pressure on the top side of her vagina not too deep in. I suppose where you would say her G-Spot is. If she is rocking with almost no movement with the root of my penis firmly against this spot if does not take long to get her off. This of course is great for me as there is not too much stimulation so I can go on for quite a while. 
<br>If we are having a good evening she can have 4 or 5 orgasms, all vaginal.  Our record is 8, while mine is 3 in a night. I haven’t come across a woman like this before, though I really can’t call myself a “well traveled man” in this regard.

<p align=left><b>[F 36] </b>In response to your visitor's question, "can you climax from thrusting
alone - without clitoral stimulation?" - in a word 'yes', but with some
qualifiers.  I've been able to achieve orgasm without 'direct' clitoral
stimulation for some time.  It took some experimentation, and a lot of
patience, but once I was able to find what worked, it's been fantastic. 
I've discovered a number of different positions that allow me to achieve
orgasm.  As an example, simply closing my legs together after my
husband's penetrated me in any face-to-face position works quite well,
although if I'm on the bottom, I also need something under my ass, such
as a pillow or his hands - anything to give just a touch of pelvic tilt.
 Also, having my husband enter me from behind works, but I tend to
experience more 'g-spot' orgasms that way.
<br>The reason that I emphasize 'direct' clitoral stimulation is that with
the face-to-face positions, there is a fair amount of contact with my
clitoris and his pubic bone, but I've never been able to cum via that
alone - I've always had to bring my legs together in order to vary the
angle of penetration and create that added 'tightness'.  I'm also
careful to point out that I can achieve orgasm through
penetration/thrusting - but to climax is a completely different matter
for me.  I can cum many times during intercourse without ever reaching
climax.  When I cum, I can feel my pussy contracting around my husband's
erection and I get that warm buzz washing over me.  Often, I'll even
feel it deeper, especially when he stimulates my g-spot, but when I
climax, I loose all control - and to achieve that, I need direct
clitoral stimulation (as well as other parts of my body).
<br>A couple of my girlfriends have reported similar success playing with
different positional variations, while others can only cum when they or
their lovers play with their clits directly.  The best advice that I've
ever heard is not to get hung up on it - if it happens, it happens and
we're all different, so just have fun trying.

<p align=left><b>Updated 9/04 [F 57] </b>This message is written in response to the question as to whether a woman can climax with thrusting alone and no clitoral stimulation.  I am very happy to say that I can, but it helps greatly if I am on top.  My husband is quite thrilled to accommodate for he is not concerned about his location as long as each of us reaches a very pleasing climax.
