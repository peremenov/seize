        These claims are based primarily on statistical probability models and are unsupportable when viewed in the context of
        other physical and documentary evidence available surrounding the benchmark.&nbsp;
        The study claims the benchmark was originally set 44.5cm above the mean level of the sea
              <font color="#800000"> (as it then existed in 1841)</font>. Since it now sits at 31.5 cm above
              <font color="#800000"> (see fig.1)</font>, the difference - 13cm - is claimed to be evidence of sea level rise.</font>
              <p>
        <font face="Arial">
        However, the man responsible for putting the mark there, explorer Sir James Clark Ross stated explicitly and</font></td>

      <p><font face="Arial">several times in his 1846 book <b><font size="2" color="#800000">[3] </font></b>that the mark was placed at MSL <font color="#800000">(as he estimated it to be)</font>, not at a point 44.5cm above,
      near the high tide point, as claimed by the study.&nbsp;
      Other evidence surrounding the original placing of the benchmark is less clear, but we do have one positive measurement of where the benchmark stood relative to sea level taken in 1888 by the then Government meteorologist, Commander J. Shortt R.N.&nbsp;
      He found the mark to be 34cm above sea level - only 2½ cm different to its current
      position <b><font size="2" color="#800000">[7] [5]</font></b>.<br>
         <br>
        This suggests a sea level rise since 1888 of only 2½cm, not 13cm as claimed by the study.&nbsp;
      This small rise of 2½ cm is fully consistent with a survey of long-term tide gauges
      <font size="2" color="#800000"><b>[15]</b></font> around the Australian coast carried out recently by the National Tidal Facility in Adelaide, which found a sea level rise rate of only 0.3 mm/yr, equivalent to a sea level rise of 3cm over a century. Even the current sea level in the inner cove
      <font color="#800000">(Mason Cove)</font> of Port Arthur itself is lower than that indicated by a tide gauge
      <b><font size="2" color="#800000">[6] </font></b>which the study claims existed there in the early 1840s.<br>
        <br>
        The 1888 measurement by Cmdr. Shortt suggests sea levels rose an incredible 44.5 - 34 = 10½ cm in only 47 years, at a time of global cooling
      and slowly uplifting land when quite the opposite should occur. While the study dismissed
      Cmdr. Shortt's measurement as inaccurate, with no coherent explanation given for that
      view, it is much more probable that the study simply got the original benchmark height wrong and that the 1888 measurement by Cmdr. Shortt was sound.<br>
        <br>
        Complicating the issue further is the possibility, expressed by Cmdr. Shortt himself, that numerous earth tremors in
      from 1883 to 1886, unprecedented either before or since, may have uplifted the land
      by an unknown degree over that period of time. Indeed, this was his stated reason for making the measurement in the first place, having received reports of just such an effect from islands in the Bass Strait.&nbsp;
      Any land uplift from the 1880s tremors would displace the benchmark upwards from its original position if the benchmark had indeed been placed at
      MSL as stated clearly by James Clark Ross.<br>
        <br>
        In addition, modern tide gauges located at Hobart and Spring Bay on either side of the Port Arthur site, on the same coast, show no sea level rise since their installation during the
      1980s <b><font size="2" color="#800000">[18]</font></b>.&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        The weight of physical and documentary evidence shows that sea level rise around Tasmania, and indeed Australia as a whole, is only very slight, and that this study is seriously in error. The reason may well be the over-reliance on statistical probability modelling at the expense of
      physical and documentary evidence.</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">This report has been prompted by the recent publication of
      a paper by Pugh <I>et al</I><font color="#800000" size="2"><b> [1]</b></font>, giving details of a 7-year&nbsp; study by the
      Universities of Southampton and Tasmania into the origins, history, and current
      height of a sea level benchmark etched onto a cliff on a small island in Port
      Arthur Harbour,
      Tasmania, in 1841.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">The authors claim the benchmark was not struck at
      <b>Mean Sea Level <font
      color="#800000">(MSL)</font> </b> as described by the man responsible for putting it there, Antarctic
      explorer <b> Captain Sir James Clark Ross</b>, acting in association
      with&nbsp; <b>Thomas Lempriere</b><font color="#800000">  (a senior official of the Port
      Arthur convict colony),&nbsp;</font> but was rather struck&nbsp; closer to high tide, the mark estimated by Pugh <I>et al</I>.&nbsp; to be 44.5 cm above MSL as it existed in
      1841.&nbsp; Since they report that the mark is now 31.5 cm above current
      MSL, as determined from modern tide gauge data, they propose
      that a sea level rise of 44.5 - 31.5 cm = <b> 13 cm</b> has therefore occurred since
      1841.&nbsp; Of this, they further propose that the current land uplift
      rate would raise the land 3.2 cm over the same period, making a net sea
      level rise of 13 - 3.2 = 9.8 cm.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">There are a number of&nbsp; height positions relative to MSL in 1841 to which the benchmark might have been&nbsp; struck - at
      44.5 cm
      above as claimed by Pugh <I>et al</I>., or 14 cm above as suggested later in this
      report or at the actual 1841 MSL itself.&nbsp; Any such scenarios involve
      unresolved issues with available evidence, the most serious of which is
      the Pugh <I>et al</I> scenario which completely contradicts the written account given by
      Ross in his 1847 book<font color="#800000" size="2"><b>  [3]</b></font>.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">Between 1841 and the modern era, we have only one
      measurement made of the height of the benchmark relative to sea level, and
      that was organised by Commander J. Shortt R.N., the Government Meteorologist of
      the day, on 24th February 1888.&nbsp; The height he reported is only 2½
      cm different to the height today, a sea level rise of only an inch in 114
      years.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">It is the Shortt measurement of 1888 which
      is critical for any scenario.&nbsp; In the case of Pugh <I>et al</I>., they have applied a
      very long error bar to the Shortt measurement,&nbsp; 26 cm, or about one third
      of the full tidal range at Port Arthur.&nbsp; It is only through this wide
      error bar that the scenario favoured by Pugh <I>et al</I> works at all as the sea
      level rise they propose depends on their sea level trend line passing through the
      extreme lower end of their 1888 error bar.&nbsp; A narrower error bar would
      require a sea level rise between 1841 and 1888 of around 10 - 12 cm, much
      too large for only 47 years during a period of global cooling and against
      the trend of a gently uplifting coast.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial">This report demonstrates some key problems with the Pugh <I>et al</I>. study and to provide an alternative scenario in
      Part 2 consistent with the known evidence surrounding the Ross-Lempriere
      benchmark.</font></p>

      extreme bottom of which is needed to allow the rising sea level trend line to
      pass through to the present.&nbsp; Indeed, at a lecture given by the study
      authors to explain
      the results<font size="2"
      color="#800000"><b>  [2]</b></font>, it was pointed out that because
      there was no evidence from elsewhere in the world that sea levels rose in
      the mid to late 19th century, then the sea level line from 1841 should
      really run horizontally to 1890 and then curve sharply upward from there to
      the present.&nbsp;In light of this, we can modify the timeline graph accordingly -</font></p>

      horizontally from the upper extreme of the 1841 error bar though the extreme lower tip of the 1888 Shortt

      error bar would put the `sea level rise' scenario in considerable
      difficulty and also call into question the validity of their 1841
      benchmark height placement.&nbsp; Their scenario cannot accommodate any
      land uplift pre-1888 as that would impose a slight sea level fall to 1888,
      again putting their trend line out of reach of the Shortt error bar.</font></p>

        made by the
        U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change <font color="#800000">(IPCC)</font>.&nbsp;
        It claims a 10 to 20 cm sea level rise since 1900, a point of some
        controversy, but which
        Pugh <I>et al</I>. regard as consistent with their result of 13 cm relative sea
        level rise at Port Arthur.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Firstly, can we see recent sea level rise?&nbsp; For Port Arthur, we
        simply don't know because the CSIRO tide gauge has been operating there
        only a few years, and mean sea level determination needs 18½ years of
        data to get a fully accurate figure.&nbsp; This is because it takes that
        long for all the variations and permutations of lunar and solar cycles
        to work themselves through one full cycle.&nbsp; However, there are
        longer-term tide gauges located at Hobart to the northwest and Spring
        Bay to the north.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the lecture it was stated&nbsp; - <font color="#FF0000">&quot;We know that sea
        level can't change very much between Hobart and Port Arthur. Simple
        calculations show that it only varies at most 1 or 2 centimetres.&quot;</font><font

        and Port Arthur tides and sea levels which has enabled Pugh <I>et al</I>. to
        give a figure for current MSL at Port Arthur as being 31.5 cm below the
        current height of the benchmark.&nbsp; This linkage between
        Hobart and Port Arthur makes sense because both harbours are adjacent to
        each other and both face&nbsp; south, opening out directly to the Southern Ocean.&nbsp; Spring Bay to the north
        is different in that it sits on the east coast of Tasmania with a sea access

        neither shows any general tendency for sea level rise - a lot of variability certainly,
        but no significant upward trend.&nbsp; The lowest sea level recorded at both sites
        was quite recently - late 1997, right in the middle of a major El Niño
        event, a separate issue which will be returned to later.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial">From this data, we can confidently conclude that whatever sea level
        rise may have happened since 1841, none of it happened since 1987 when
        the Hobart tide gauge data from PSMSL begins.&nbsp; If Pugh <I>et al</I>. were right, then
        the sea level rise they claim - all of it - must have been pre-1987.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">This brings us to the work of <b>Bruce Hamon</b> <b><font size="2"
        color="#800000">[5]</font></b>, who researched the benchmark well before
        Pugh <I>et al</I>., publishing a paper on the subject in 1985.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Hamon also published his paper well before climate change and sea level
        rise became a political issue and his paper can therefore be viewed as a fairly
        neutral assessment on his part.&nbsp; Using the
        Hobart tide constants as his guide, he determined MSL at Port Arthur to
        be 36 cm below the level of the benchmark, although he himself put an
        error range of ±5 cm for any single spot observation - such as the one
        he himself made.&nbsp; This makes his observation and associated error
        bar within&nbsp; the latest
        estimate of 31.5 cm given in the Pugh <I>et al</I>. study.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">But Hamon did more than merely measure the benchmark relative to MSL
        in 1985.&nbsp; He proceeded to use Hobart tidal constants to effectively
        go back in time.&nbsp; Just as tides can be predicted years into the
        future, once each areas tide constants are known, it is equally possible to
        predict tides years into the <i>past</i>, many decades even.&nbsp; Hamon took
        his analysis right back to 1888 when Cmdr. Shortt made his measurement
        of the benchmark.</font></p>

        Tasmania, the state's premier scientific body.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">During the early 1880s, and immediately in the
        wake of the mammoth eruption of Krakatau in August 1883, Tasmania was subjected to over a thousand earth
        tremors, mostly on the eastern half of the island <b><font size="2"

        tremors were unprecedented in number or scale either before or
        since.&nbsp; Three years later, Shortt published his paper on the Ross-Lempriere
        benchmark </font><b><font size="2" color="#800000">[7]</font></b><font color="#000000" size="3">, and explained that it was because of the possible vertical

        height of the benchmark so that future vertical movements of the land,
        if any, could be accurately tracked.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Shortt himself did not do the actual measurement.&nbsp; He

        <p><font face="Arial"><font size="3"
        color="#FF0000">&quot;Mr. Mason, at my request, very kindly ascertained
        the time of low water on February 24th, 1888, at 11 h. 45 m. a.m., which
        day corresponds relatively with the moon's age 45 years previously</font><font

        difference between these levels of low and high water,...&quot;</font><font
        size="3" color="#000000">.</font></font></p>
        <p><font size="3" color="#000000" face="Arial">Clearly this is a `spot' measurement
        and potentially contains a lot of room for error, amply justifying a
        large error bar on the timeline graph in the absence of any other
        information which might narrow down those errors.&nbsp; There are
        potential errors from the observer himself, there are errors arising
        from the complex pattern of tides in that region, and there are errors
        which might arise from meteorological variability such as strong
        westerly winds making the tides pile up, or atmospheric pressure changes
        which can raise or depress the local sea level.&nbsp; Any or all of
        these uncertainty factors calls for a significant 1888 error bar on the
        timeline graph.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" color="#000000" face="Arial">With regard to observer
        error, if the observer was an outsider visiting Port Arthur for the
        first time, then such an observer would have no idea if the measurement
        they were making was normal for that location or somehow anomalous due
        to some local variable skewing the sea level on that occasion. The error
        bar for such a measurement would have to be very wide in the absence of
        any application of knowledge about local tides, winds, or pressure.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" color="#000000" face="Arial">Then we have
        what we might call an `informed spot measurement', one where the
        observer already has some of that additional information and acts on it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font size="3" color="#000000">My photograph of the benchmark</font><font
        size="3" color="#800000"> (fig 6)</font><font size="3" color="#000000">
        represents just one such `informed spot measurement'.&nbsp; In my first
        report over two years ago on this issue, I estimated the current height
        of the benchmark to be 30 cm above mean sea level.&nbsp; Since we now
        know it is 31.5 cm above, that was an error of only 1½ cm on my
        part.&nbsp;&nbsp; How did I manage to achieve such close accuracy?&nbsp;
        It could of course be plain luck, but I did&nbsp; choose a day close to
        the same age of the moon as on the day
        the benchmark was struck.&nbsp; Next, I checked the
        National Tidal Facility in Adelaide to find out the times of the tides
        at nearby Hobart and Spring Bay on the day I intended to visit the Isle of the
        Dead.&nbsp; From this, I determined the most likely time of mean tide </font><font
        size="3" color="#800000">(not itself mean sea level, but close)</font><font
        size="3" color="#000000">.&nbsp; I even checked the barometric pressure
        on the day to make due allowance for that also.</font></font></p>
        <p><font size="3" color="#000000" face="Arial">With that information, I hired a boat
        and took the photo of the benchmark at the expected time of mean tide.&nbsp; Once there, I found a lot of swell
        in the vicinity of the cliff where the benchmark was located, but from
        carefully observing the ebb and flow of that swell, I was soon able to settle
        visually on where the mean level at any one time was. I took the photo
        at the time of expected mean tide.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font size="3" color="#000000">When I looked at the photo afterward,
        I saw that the benchmark was sitting about 40 cm above the water </font><font
        size="3" color="#800000">(using the horizontal line of the benchmark -
        50 cm - as a guide.&nbsp; See fig.6)</font><font size="3" color="#000000">.&nbsp; Since
        atmospheric pressure was 1024 mb on the day I did it, thus depressing
        sea level by nearly 10 cm, I subtracted that 10 cm from the 40 cm visual
        height to arrive at a figure of 30 cm for the adjusted height.&nbsp;
        Nothing too difficult or complicated.&nbsp; No ruler or measuring
        stick, just knowledge of the tide times, moon phase, and the atmospheric
        pressure and wind.</font></font></p>
        <p><font size="3" color="#000000" face="Arial">My final answer, 30 cm, ended up only 1½ cm different to the real figure
        determined at some considerable cost of personnel time and a
        state-of-the-art tide gauge.&nbsp; If I could do that, it is simply not
        credible to imagine that someone else with better local knowledge than
        mine would
        end up incurring an error bar 26 cm wide.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" color="#000000" face="Arial">This example is given to show that
        the claimed difficulties in making a good spot measurement may be
        over-rated, perhaps for reasons of professional pride rather than any
        genuine difficulty, and that it is not necessarily inaccurate provided it is integrated&nbsp;
        with that additional information such as knowledge of tide times,
        heights, meteorology, and phases of the moon.&nbsp; If I could do it to within 1½
        cm, with such simple methodology, there's no reason to suppose a local
        man with local knowledge, Mr. Mason, could not do
        equally well or better, especially as he was measuring it from the low
        tide point and not the more turbulent mean tide that I used.&nbsp; A 5 cm error bar,
        as suggested by Hamon, to allow for potential observer error is therefore
        perfectly reasonable in the circumstances.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" color="#000000" face="Arial">Tidal variability is
        sufficiently complex at Port Arthur to impose a significant error on
        Shortt's measurement.&nbsp; However, this was removed by Bruce Hamon and
        his backward projection of tides.&nbsp; Because Shortt gave the exact
        date and time of the measurement, 11.45 a.m. on 24th February 1888,
        Hamon was able to determine where low tide <i> should have been</i> on that day,
        based on the Hobart tide constants.&nbsp; From that he was able to
        correct for any error created by tidal variability. He wrote -</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">&quot;Shortt found the mark 2ft 6in
        (0.76m) above low water, at 11.45 local time on 24 February 1888.&nbsp;
        Again using the Hobart tide constants, I found the tide at this time to
        be 0.42 m below mean sea level.&nbsp; Predicted low tide was about 30
        minutes later, and only 1 cm lower. &quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font size="3" color="#000000">Finally, he
        completed the tidal
        correction - </font><font size="3" color="#FF0000">&quot;Shortt's
        observation corresponds to the mark being<br>
        0.76 - 0.42 = <b>0.34 m</b> above
        mean sea level in 1888... &quot;</font><font size="3" color="#000000">
        </font><font color="#000000" size="2">
        (my emphasis - JD)</font><font size="3" color="#000000">.</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font size="3" color="#000000">So, the observer error range is about 5 cm, and tidal error has been largely removed by Hamon's
        calculation.&nbsp; That leaves the meteorological error.&nbsp; This
        is potentially quite large because strong westerly winds in southeastern
        Tasmania cause a `pile up' of the tides and result in very high tides
        all along the east and south coasts, including Port Arthur.&nbsp; In addition,
        every millibar of pressure above or below the mean pressure of 1014.8 mb</font><b><font
        size="2" color="#800000">  [5]</font></b><font size="3" color="#000000">
        results in a raising or lowering of sea level by about 1 cm.&nbsp; That
        imposes a huge uncertainty on any spot measurement since it could make
        the sea level as much as 10 cm higher or lower than normal.&nbsp; It
        certainly did so on the day I photographed it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font size="3" color="#000000">On this issue, Hamon regrets to inform
        us&nbsp; - </font><font size="3" color="#FF0000">&quot;We cannot apply a
        correction for atmospheric pressure in this case, as no Hobart data for
        for 1888 are available.&quot;&nbsp;</font><font size="3" color="#000000">
        That lack of atmospheric pressure and wind data means that the Shortt
        observation would need a wide error bar after all.</font></font></p>
        <p><font size="3" color="#000000" face="Arial">During a recent discussion group emailing
        over a period of a week, after receipt of their paper and attendance at
        their lecture,&nbsp; I asked one of the authors what the basis was for the long error bar
        applied to the Shortt/Hamon measurement for 1888, as the paper itself
        was somewhat vague on the point.&nbsp; The reply -</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font color="#FF0000">&quot;After adjusting for the tides, you are still left with the meteorological variability, which is simply caused by the effects of the weather (e.g. winds and atmospheric pressure) on the oceans.&quot;<font

        comm.]</font></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font size="3" color="#000000">I took this to mean that the big
        unknown
        that Hamon acknowledged, atmospheric pressure, formed the basis
        for the large error bar applied to the Shortt/Hamon observation, its
        size making it possible for the sea level timeline in their graphic </font><font
        size="3" color="#800000">(fig.8)</font><font size="3" color="#000000">
        to squeeze in through the extreme lower tip of the Shortt error bar.</font></font></p>
        <p><font size="3" color="#000000" face="Arial">Although Hamon did not have
        those atmospheric pressure or wind figures, they were on public record.&nbsp;
        Once I concluded from the email discussion that pressure and wind
        uncertainty was the primary reason for the long 1888 error bar used by Pugh <I>et al</I>.,&nbsp;
        it took me about half an hour at the public library to find the relevant
        data on pressure and wind in 1888.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font size="3" color="#000000">On 24th February 1888, the atmospheric
        pressure at Hobart was 29.96 inches, which converts to <b>1014.7
        millibars</b>.&nbsp; The wind was <b>light south-easterly</b></font><b><font
        color="#800000" size="2">  [10]</font></b><font size="3" color="#000000">.&nbsp;
        This information was contained in the `Shipping News' of one of the
        local papers of the time, the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pugh <I>et als</I>.
        determination of such a large error bar for
        the Shortt measurement suggests they were including meteorological
        uncertainty as a key factor in their calculation of that error bar, an uncertainty which
        now no longer exists.</font></font></p>
        <p><font size="3" color="#000000" face="Arial">Now that we have the wind and
        pressure data, that particular uncertainty is redundant.&nbsp; Since
        Hamon estimated modern mean pressure in the region to be 1014.8 millibars, the lack of
        wind and the Hobart
        pressure for that day, 1014.7 mb, means that no adjustment is
        necessary.&nbsp; The figure of 34 cm can stand without any significant correction or
        uncertainty allowance for wind or pressure.&nbsp; A light south-easterly
        wind on 28th February would have minimal effect on the height of the
        tide that day.&nbsp;&nbsp; The pressure of that day, 1014.7 mb, is only
        0.1 mb different to the modern mean pressure for that area reported by
        Hamon.&nbsp; Consequently, the sea levels measured in 1888 and in 1985
        by Hamon <i>are directly comparable</i> since the two atmospheric pressures
        were practically the same.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" color="#000000" face="Arial">Clearly, an error bar 26 cm long on the
        Shortt measurement, fully one third of the tidal range, is at odds with observation now that both
        tides, pressure, and wind have been accounted for.&nbsp; Only a smaller

        <p><font size="3" color="#FF0000" face="Arial">&quot;From a comparison of Spring Bay sea level data and SOI, I find that sea level varies approximately<br>
        as SOI/40 m. Now SOI for February and March 1888 was -0.33 and -1.47 (see
        <a href="http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/ftpdata/soi.dat">http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/ftpdata/soi.dat</a>
        ). For an approximate SOI value for 24 Feb. 1888, I therefore take an average of -0.33 and
        -1.47, which is -0.9. The average SOI for 1866 to 1997 is -0.067,<br>
        which I will take as a reference value. Therefore the SOI adjustment should be (0.9-0.067)/40 = 0.02 m.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">That's a 2 centimetre error factor which <i> should</i> have been
        integrated into
        the Shortt error bar.&nbsp; I checked the Spring Bay data from PSMSL for myself.&nbsp; Instead of using
        a SOI-based procedure as quoted above, I averaged the whole data from 1987 to 2000, then subtracted from
        it the
        average of the months of the 1997-98 El Niño.&nbsp; Sure enough, the
        answer also came to 2 cm.&nbsp; even though my method was
        different.&nbsp; Since the SOI is a statistical index based on
        comparative <i>air pressure</i> between Darwin and Tahiti, I did not regard it's use as a constant in
        local <i>sea level</i>
        determination to be particularly appropriate, as subtracting averages of
        sea levels directly made much better sense.&nbsp; Besides, using the
        pressure-based SOI as part of a sea level calculation creates an&nbsp;
        `apples and oranges' effect which may look mathematically elegant, but
        in reality be somewhat meaningless.&nbsp; That we came to the same answer
        for Spring Bay is interesting, perhaps coincidental, but would not
        necessarily agree for other stations.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">However, both Hamon and Pugh <I>et al</I>. have consistently used Hobart as
        their frame of reference for Port Arthur, particularly as both harbours
        face south, whereas Spring Bay faces east and more easily subject to
        wind and coastal effects on the tides.&nbsp; Performing the same
        subtraction of averages on the Hobart data yielded an El Niño sea level
        effect of<b> 5 cm</b>, not 2 cm.&nbsp; The statement at the lecture
        - <font color="#FF0000">&quot;We know that sea
        level can't change very much between Hobart and Port Arthur. Single
        calculations show that it only varies at most 1 or 2 centimetres.&quot; </font>means
        that any El Niño effects at Hobart will show up with a similar
        magnitude at Port Arthur.&nbsp; It is this 5 cm correction which should
        therefore be applied to the Shortt measurement of 1888, not the 2 cm one
        would get from Spring Bay.&nbsp; The chart now looks like this -</font></p>

        offered by Pugh <I>et al</I>. is in deep difficulty.&nbsp; With a narrower error

        accomplished between the years 1841 and 1888, a period where the authors
        themselves acknowledged in the lecture saw no general sea level rise at all anywhere else in the world.&nbsp;
        The&nbsp; Shortt measurement is now scarcely different to the current position of the benchmark.&nbsp;&nbsp; The idea
        that a steep sea level rise took place between 1890 and 2000 is
        simply&nbsp; not credible.&nbsp; In addition, land uplift of about 2½
        cm since 1888 would make the centre of the Shortt measurement exactly

From the foregoing, the Pugh <I>et al</I>. study is faced with this problem.&nbsp;
Should the sea level trend line in fig.16 be the red one, or the purple
one?&nbsp; The purple one is that suggested by the authors at the lecture, but is
clearly untenable given that we cannot now justify the excessively long 1888 error bar.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even with the original error bar, it only then barely
squeezed in using the upper extreme of 1841 and the lower extreme of
1888.&nbsp; The red sea level trend line&nbsp; is physically impossible.&nbsp;
There was slight global cooling going on during the 1841-1910 period, and that
would if anything cause a sea level fall of about 3 cm, not a rise.&nbsp; In
addition, the land itself is measured by them to be uplifting very slowly - 3.2
cm over the full 160 years.&nbsp; That means their sea level rise would have
been swimming uphill against global cooling <i> and</i> rising land, a physical
impossibility given the climatic circumstances and the available evidence.&nbsp;
Probability statistics may attempt to explain it away,

      such subsidence at nearby sites.&nbsp; If those two tide gauges are excluded

          return from the Antarctic seas, which is the reason of my not having

        <p><font face="Arial">His friend, Governor Sir John Franklin, informed him that an official
        of the convict colony at Port Arthur, Thomas Lempriere, had been keeping
        tide measurements for some time and that perhaps that would afford a
        means of placing a sea level benchmark at Port Arthur.&nbsp; Ross seized
        the opportunity and went to Port Arthur, with the Governor, in May 1841
        to meet Thomas Lempriere - <b><font size="2" color="#800000">[17]</font></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font color="#ff0000">&quot;My principal object in
        visiting Port Arthur was to afford a comparison of our standard
        barometer with that which had been employed for several years by Mr.
        Lempriere, the Deputy Assistant Commissary General, in accordance
        with my instructions, and also to establish <b>a permanent mark</b> at
        the <b>zero point</b>, or <b>general mean level of the sea</b>  <b> as
        determined by the tidal observations</b> which Mr. Lempriere had conducted
        with perseverance and exactness for some time: by which means any
        secular variation in the relative level of the land and sea, which is
        known to occur on some coasts, might at any future period be detected,
        and its amount determined. The point chosen for this purpose was the
        perpendicular cliff of<b>  </b> the small islet off Point Puer, which, being
        near to the tide register, <b> rendered</b> the operation more simple and
        exact; the Governor, whom I had accompanied on an official visit
        to the settlement, gave directions to afford Mr. Lempriere every
        assistance of labourers he required, to have the mark cut deeply in the
        rock <b>in the exact spot which his tidal observations indicated as the
        mean level of the ocean</b>.&quot;</font><font color="#800000"> &nbsp;<font

        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">With such an explicit explanation of what
        the benchmark was for, and where it was placed, it becomes perplexing
        that Pugh <I>et al</I>. did not take this testimony seriously enough to exhaust
        every possible avenue by which their study could avoid contradicting
        this very clear account.&nbsp; But contradict it they did - they took
        the view that the benchmark did not end up at `zero point' at all, but
        at a height closer to high tide.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">They justified this view by citing what
        Ross himself said a little later in his narrative.&nbsp; Speaking of any
        future such sea level mark, he said -&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#FF0000">&quot;I may here observe,
        that it is not essential that the mark be made exactly at the mean level
        of the ocean, indeed it is more desirable that it should be rather above
        the reach of the highest tide: it is, however, important that it be made
        on some part of a solid cliff, not liable to rapid disintegration, and
        the exact distance above the mean level (which may also be marked more
        slightly) recorded on a plate of copper, well protected from the
        weather...&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">He added -</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font size="3" color="#FF0000">&quot;The most desirable
        position for such another mark would be near the north-west extremity of
        the island, and in the vicinity of Cape Grim...&quot;.&nbsp;</font><font
        face="Arial" color="#000000" size="2"> (Cape Grim is at the
        north-western tip of Tasmania - JD)</font><font
        face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">.</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font size="3" color="#000000">What Ross was referring
        to here was not the mark on the Isle of the Dead - he wrote about that
        in the past tense, as something already done,
        `rendered' - but rather about prospective&nbsp; <i>future</i>
        marks.&nbsp; These passages can in no way be interpreted as modifying or
        negating what he wrote earlier about the Isle of the Dead
        benchmark.&nbsp;&nbsp; To impute such a meaning to it is quite
        misleading. Besides, the benchmark was not even struck `above the reach of the
        highest tide', but rather at some point below high tide and fully exposed to
        the sea.</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3" color="#000000">Ross did eventually get
        an opportunity to strike a second mark, this time in the Falkland
        Islands, and he did exactly what he said above - struck it over 5 feet
        above mean sea level, `above the reach of the highest tide', with a plaque
        to indicate the exact height of the mark above the real mean sea level.&nbsp;
        That particular mark in the Falklands now poses a puzzle of its own - it shows no sea
        level rise.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Pugh <I>et al</I>. deny the accuracy of the Ross
        testimony.&nbsp;
        Are they saying Ross was mistaken?&nbsp; A liar?&nbsp; Did Lempriere do
        something contrary to what Ross and the Governor ordered?&nbsp; It should take compelling evidence to contradict such a clear and precise testimony
        by someone with the stature of James Clark Ross..</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">But, let us assume Pugh <I>et al</I>. were right and
        that the benchmark was not struck where Ross said it was.&nbsp; That
        would mean that (a) Ross was a liar, or (b) Lempriere did the job alone
        and struck the mark in a different place, or in a different way, to what
        Ross instructed, or (c) Ross had a lapse of memory about it all and
        misreported the whole episode in his book.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Taking each in turn,&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Scenario (a) is a
        non-starter.&nbsp; Ross was a respected officer of the Royal Navy, and a
        scientist and explorer.&nbsp; The Ross Sea in Antarctica is named after him.&nbsp; He
        knew only too well the importance of exactness when it came to
        scientific endeavours.&nbsp; He was also a mariner, and seafarers have
        their own set of ethics, one of which is to report navigation
        information accurately - lives may depend on it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Scenario (b) is possible, but only if Ross
        was not present at the time the benchmark was struck.&nbsp; Had Ross
        been supervising the operation personally, or just overseeing it, he
        would not have reported the mark as being at mean sea level.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        In addition, Thomas Lempriere had a wife and 11 children in cramped
        quarters at Port Arthur.&nbsp; He was desperately seeking both promotion
        and better accommodations for his large family, and it is therefore
        unthinkable that he would perform his task in any way other than to follow the
        instructions of Ross - and indeed the Governor - to the letter.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Scenario (c) is not credible
        either.&nbsp; Ross was only 41 years old when he met Lempriere, and his
        book was published only 6 years later, making age-related memory loss very
        unlikely for such an important project by a man in his prime.&nbsp; His sense of seafarer's ethics would also have persuaded him
        to report the positioning benchmark with proper attention to accuracy as
        other seafarers might come across the benchmark sometime in the future..</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">Of the three scenarios, only <font
        color="#800000">(b) (i.e. Lempriere acting in defiance of instructions)</font> could
        possibly explain the benchmark being struck at a height different to
        that reported by Ross.&nbsp; This then raises the question - <b>was Ross present at
        Port Arthur on the day?</b>&nbsp; If he was present, then there is no
        way the benchmark would have been stuck at near high tide - and then for
        Ross to misreport it in his book.&nbsp; If he was present, then we can
        be confident the mark really was struck at what Ross and/or Lempriere
        estimated MSL to be.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="3">We have no confirmed evidence that Ross
        was present on the day.&nbsp; What we do have is four items of
        circumstantial evidence -</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font size="3">1) A cruising yachtsman visited the Isle
        of the Dead in 1891</font><b><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#800000">
        [4]</font></b><font face="Arial" size="3"> and saw the benchmark
        there.&nbsp; He also saw something else - a small stone tablet mounted above the benchmark,<font color="#FF0000"> &quot;...erected it is said by
        Captain Ross, of the <i>Erebus</i> and <i>Terror</i> Antarctic
        expedition, during the interval between the visits to the south polar
        regions.&quot;</font>&nbsp; We will return to that stone tablet later,
        but since 1841 was within the living memory of many of the local people
        of 1891,
        their collective memory that Ross struck the benchmark suggests he was
        present on the day. Ross was not the kind of man people would forget
        easily.&nbsp; He was very famous.</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font size="3">2) Ross was positively placed at Hobart&nbsp;
        </font><font color="#000000">on 29th
        June, 1841</font><font color="#800000"> (when he was engaged in compass

        was nothing to prevent Ross&nbsp; making a brief overnight visit to Port Arthur to
        oversee the striking of the benchmark.&nbsp; Had Lempriere
        deviated from the original plan in Ross' absence, he had sufficient time
        and means to send a message to Ross to that effect, either by the very
        quick semaphore signalling system which linked Hobart and Port Arthur,
        or by sending a letter by sea, or even by meeting Ross' ships </font><font

        color="#000000"> as they passed the harbour mouth of Port Arthur a week
        later on their way to Sydney. Since Ross published his account
        six years later in 1847, there was even ample time for normal mail.</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><font color="#000000">3) Pugh <I>et al</I>. stated this
        in their paper - </font><font face="Arial, Geneva" color="#FF0000">&quot;Ross
        may have been present, although preparations for the departure of his
        expedition from Hobart on 7 July would have also demanded his
        attention.&nbsp; Examination of the copy of the official letter-book
        (now in the Scott Polar Research Institute, Cambridge; called `Ross
        Family Papers' in Ross, 1982) show that no official letters were signed
        by Ross around 1 July.&quot;</font><font color="#000000"
        face="Arial, Geneva">&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the ships were due for departure
        from Hobart within a week, the lack of signed letters around that day suggests Ross was
        out of town.&nbsp; Where? At Port Arthur?&nbsp; Port Arthur was the only
        matter important enough to pull him away from Hobart during that final
        week of his visit to Tasmania.</font></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">(4)&nbsp;<font color="#000000" face="Arial, Geneva"> Lempriere kept a

        <p><font face="Arial">Look at the sudden change of the formatting.&nbsp; The upper part for
        June 1841 shows long dashes between numerals, making it possible for
        someone to confuse what number refers to what.&nbsp; Suddenly, as of 1st
        July, the formatting changes from a long dash to a mere dot, much
        clearer and less prone to reading error.&nbsp; Who advised him to make
        that change?&nbsp; The upper formatting was present on all pre-July
        logs, while the lower formatting style was present on all subsequent
        logs.&nbsp; The abruptness of the change suggests someone asked him to do
        it for clarity's sake, and did so on 1st July 1841.&nbsp; That someone could only be Ross as there
        was no-one of seniority in Port Arthur who was interested enough in
        Lempriere's tide log to suggest or demand such a change.&nbsp; Lempriere is
        even on record as wanting to please the scientific community as much as
        possible and a `suggestion' by such a luminary as Ross would be all the
        excuse Lempriere would need to change the formatting style of his tide
        log.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Individually, all these are merely circumstantial.&nbsp; But

        the exact same formatting style
        for times <font color="#800000">(post-1st July)</font>&nbsp; as the yachtsman used, but not Mr.
        Mason.&nbsp; There are subtler differences still, such as the
        yachtsman's use of capital letters at the start of sentences, and the
        yachtsman's inclusion of commas.</font></p>

                did not stop merely with the tablet.&nbsp; He also looked at
                some of the gravestones, one of which he recited word for word
                in his article in <i>The Australasian</i> magazine, and even
                drew an accurate&nbsp; sketch of it.&nbsp;</font><p><font
                face="Arial">That gravestone still exists today and is fully readable in
                spite of the passage of time. It is the gravestone of one Joseph
                Kerr, and the yachtsman's version of what was written on it
                matches the wording on the same gravestone today <i>exactly</i>,
                word for word.&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">It is for this reason that the yachtsman's version of what
                was written on that `curious little stone' should be treated
                more with much more credibility than it has been.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
                <p><font face="Arial">Furthermore, Cmdr. Shortt added this to Mason's reading of
                the tablet -</font>
                <p> <font color="#FF0000" face="Arial">&quot;It is stated by my
                informant, Mr. Mason, that the words and figures underlined
                are nearly obliterated, and that he has given what they appear
                to be.&quot;</font></td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </div>
        <p><font face="Arial">Looking to Mason's version above, we see the phrase `now struck'
        underlined, as per Shortt's qualifier, but there were no figures underlined as Shortt claimed.&nbsp; We are therefore
        left to ponder exactly which figure or set of figures were problematic.&nbsp; The
        time?&nbsp; The tide height?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">The yachtsman gave no indication of having any problem with reading the
        words on the tablet, so we are left with something of a puzzle
        here.&nbsp; Which time is the right one?&nbsp; Which tide height
        applies?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial">Taking them in turn, the time of 4.44 p.m. reported by Mason is
        almost consistent with a height of 6ft 1in in Lempriere's tide gauge, based on the data in his log, but 2.44 p.m. definitely is not.&nbsp;
        However, 4.44 p.m. <font color="#800000">(4.55 p.m. modern Australian
        Eastern Standard Time)</font> is a very strange time of day to be doing important
        survey work - close to the winter solstice of the southern hemisphere,
        virtually at twilight, and close to high tide when striking a benchmark
        would be both difficult and potentially dangerous due to the depth and turbulence of water at the
        cliff face.&nbsp; On the other hand, the yachtsman's 2.44
        p.m. in mid afternoon makes much better sense as there was good light
        and a lower tide.</font></p>

                <p><font face="Arial">Now look at this blow-up of Lempriere's tide log and examine
                the 5's and 6's.&nbsp; The fourth one down on the left is

                <p><font face="Arial">Even in our modern era, it is common for `6' and `5' to be

        On that occasion, they simply reported on Mr. Mason's 1888 reading and

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>With Fremantle clearly
        invalid, </b></font><b><font face="Arial" size="2">that leaves only Fort Denison and Port Pirie of the
        three 60-year plus stations.</font></b></p>
        <p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">On the face of it, Fort
        Denison's sea level rise would seem to support Hunter<i> et al.&nbsp;</i>
        But does it?</font></b></p>
        <p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">A careful look at the
        plot of Fort Denison below shows that most of the sea level rise there
        took place in a 3-year period between 1948 and 1951 when an apparent
        stepwise rise in long-term sea level, of about 6 centimetres,
        occurred.&nbsp; This is impossible physically.&nbsp; Sea level cannot
        simply rise 6 cm in three years from one long-term level to another
        higher level.&nbsp; It is also unlikely to be caused by land subsidence
        as that too is a slow cumulative process as happens at Fremantle, not a
        sudden step action.&nbsp; Earthquakes or tremors could cause it - if
        severe or numerous enough - <font color="#800000">(such as the 1,000
        tremors which happened in eastern Tasmania during the early 1880s, and
        which may have affected sea level at the Isle of the Dead during that
        period.)</font>.&nbsp;
        But that seems very unlikely in the case of Sydney Harbour.&nbsp; That
        leaves instrumentation problems as the only viable explanation for the
        sudden datum shift around 1948-51.&nbsp; Such datum shifts caused by
        instrument problems are very common with tide gauges, such as those of
        Hobart <a href="hobart-msl.gif">shown here</a>. Simple fouling
        by sea weed, marine growths and debris is all it takes to skew readings
        from a tide gauge.&nbsp; Relocation or instrument replacement can also
        cause such shifts.</font></b></p>

        <p align="left"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">But suppose Hunter <i>et
        al.</i> was right and that the Fort Denison datum shift was a genuine
        sea level rise and not an artifact of instrument problems.&nbsp; Such a
        large sea level rise could not go un-noticed at the other long-term tide
        gauge in Australia - Port Pirie in South Australia</font></b></p>
