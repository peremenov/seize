<B>Ludendorff, General Erich</b>.  (1865-1937).  Born, Kruszewnia, Prussia.
<BR>
<br>
 Born in Kruszczewina (Posen), W. Prussia, 9 April
1865 to a family of small businessmen, Ludendorff chose a military career. He received his commission in 1882 at age 17, serving in the usual assignments
and completing training for the general staff.&nbsp; In 1904 came the call
to Berlin to serve on the Great General Staff.&nbsp; He worked in section
II, responsible for deployment and mobilization plans. In 1908 he became
head of the section, the most prestigious position excepting the Chief
of the General Staff.

<P>
 Having an excitable and highly strung temperament,
the strong-willed Ludendorff proved a difficult subordinate.&nbsp; Charged
with refining and improving the Schlieffen Plan in the years before the
war, he became convinced that Germany lacked the trained manpower to defeat
the French in a rapid campaign. Ludendorff insisted that the government
raise additional forces. When this suggestion met disapproval, he by-passed
his superiors and initiated contact with politicians in an effort to influence
the budget.&nbsp; That the German political system could not bear the
cost of additional units was something he never considered.&nbsp; To him,
it was a matter of will.&nbsp; The response was a transfer to a
 regiment in D&uuml;sseldorf, safely away from Berlin.&nbsp; A year
later he was given a brigade in Strasbourg and promoted to general, but
his mobilization orders as quartermaster general (he should have
 been an army chief of staff as a brigadier general) of the 2d Army
indicated he was still persona non grata in Berlin.
<p>
When war came in August 1914, fortune smiled.&nbsp;
In the confusion of the attack on Li&egrave;ge, Ludendorff received the
surrender of the city, and Germany had its first war hero.&nbsp; The Kaiser
personally decorated him with Prussia's highest award, the <I>Pour le merit&eacute;</I>,
the second of the war.&nbsp; The situation in the east, where two Russian
armies threatened to break through German
 defenses, demanded his brilliance and capability for superb staff work.&nbsp;
As a counterweight to his volatility, the High Command recalled from retirement
General Paul v. Hindenburg, a phlegmatic, no-nonsense, even cautious officer,
to command 8th Army.&nbsp; Ludendorff became chief of staff.&nbsp; The
two generals met for the first time en route to East Prussia.&nbsp; The
situation they confronted was threatening and risky, but by no means hopeless.
With the able assistance of the 8th Army's operations officer, Max Hoffmann,
the Germans routed the Russians at the Battles of
 Tannenberg (August 1914) and Masurian Lakes (September 1914). The impressive
victories electrified Germany and cemented Ludendorff's reputation as the
man of genius.&nbsp; The image of the
 invincible duo of Hindenburg and Ludendorff took root in the German
mind.&nbsp; They became legends to a people demoralized by the bloody stalemate
in the west.&nbsp; For Ludendorff, who grew
 increasingly critical of the western war effort, the lack of success
reflected a lack of will.&nbsp; He called for "total war."&nbsp; Convinced
of his own judgment, his vocal criticism of the war effort mounted, and
he campaigned endlessly against those who opposed him.

<P>
The apostle of total war got his chance when the
Kaiser, staggered by the losses at Verdun, sent Hindenburg and Ludendorff
westward to take-over the German war effort.&nbsp; Ludendorff took the
 title Quartermaster General and received a promotion to lieutenant
general, while Hindenburg, already a field marshal, became chief of the
general staff.&nbsp; Shocked by the materiel superiority of the Allies
and convinced that the civilian leadership lacked the will to prosecute
the war to the fullest,
 Ludendorff initiated the Hindenburg Program.&nbsp; Largely a military
take-over of the economy including compulsory labor coupled with a ruthless
exploitation of occupied territories, the unpopular
 program resulted in considerable production gains while sapping home
front morale.&nbsp; Convinced German defense operations were too static
and hence costly, Ludendorff introduced new tactics that
 emphasized an elastic defense in depth.&nbsp; To free divisions for
reinforcements, Ludendorff conducted a massive shortening of German lines
by evacuating his forces <I>Operation Alberich</I> to the Siegfried Line
in early 1917.&nbsp; The Allies called the line the Hindenburg Line. The
withdrawn area was left a wasteland.

<P>
Ludendorff recognized the strategy of the war had
become one of attrition.&nbsp; With her inferior resources compounded by
the strangling English naval blockade, Germany could not win with
this strategy.&nbsp; Consumed by fears that time was running out, Ludendorff
convinced Hindenburg that Germany had to husband resources for a knock-out
blow on the western front.&nbsp; Shortening the lines to free up units,
stepping up the Hindenburg Program, and wrapping up the war in the east
would free the resources needed for the decisive blow.

<P>
Convinced that only total effort could achieve victory,
Ludendorff shrank from nothing.&nbsp; Accepting the Navy's contention that
a return to unrestricted submarine warfare would bring a halt to the delivery
of vital American munitions, Ludendorff urged its adoption knowing America
would enter the war.&nbsp; He severely underestimated both the U.S. military
potential and the speed with which it could be brought to bear.

<P>
By now there were voices of opposition in Germany
to his increasingly bullying manner and excessive authority.&nbsp; Hardly
an area of German life remained outside his grasp by 1918.&nbsp; The
 Kaiser loathed and feared him, but he could not stand up to him. Ludendorff
contemptuously dismissed peace initiatives and war weariness as manifestations
of a lack of will.&nbsp; He spared no one,
 including himself and his family.&nbsp; Two of his stepsons fell in
combat, losses which made him harder.&nbsp; He relentlessly attacked those
who opposed his measures, including Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg, whom he
forced from office by mid-1917.

<P>
The submarine campaign served only to bring the U.S.
into the war.&nbsp; American forces began arriving at a rate undreamed
of by their foes.&nbsp; Only the collapse of Russia under the Bolsheviks,
to which Ludendorff had indirectly contributed by transporting Lenin from
Switzerland to Russia, brightened the otherwise disastrous picture.&nbsp;
Convinced any peace terms would be unacceptable, a belief fed indirectly
by his own draconic demands upon the hapless Russians, he cobbled together
the esources for one last great push, the Spring Offensive of 1918.&nbsp;
By stripping units from the east, Ludendorff increased his strength in
the west by 30%.&nbsp; Special units (Storm Battalions) trained in new,
infiltration tactics, used surprise and mobility to by-pass enemy strong
points and emerge behind enemy lines into the open. Traditional infantry
units following along reduced the by-passed areas.&nbsp; A complete absence of the new weapon, the tank, constituted
a major weakness to the otherwise formidable restructuring.&nbsp; Ludendorff
had seen tanks, but he belittled their importance and dismissed his soldiers'
concerns as a lack of will, a strange lapse in a man who usually incorporated
his subordinates' suggestions.

<P>Ludendorff's spring offensive, code-named <I>Kaiserschlacht</I>,
called for a series of attacks rather than a single break-through.&nbsp;
The Quartermaster General planned a number of sharp blows to collapse the
entire western Allied front.&nbsp; The first onslaught began on 21 March.&nbsp;
Although badly shaken, the Allies finally held, and Ludendorff called off
the advance in early April.&nbsp; His next two operations followed the
same pattern: extraordinary initial successes petering out owing to a lack
of reserves and supplies.&nbsp; The end had come; the Germans could not
make good their losses.

<P>Ludendorff collapsed under the stress.&nbsp; He had
lost his second son in the offensive, and on occasion his ravings against
defeatists and incompetent civilians turned into uncontrollable tantrums.&nbsp; On the 28th of September, he told Hindenburg and his
staff that Germany must seek an immediate armistice.&nbsp; The Kaiser and
Chancellor Hertling heard this sad news the next day, and
 agreed.&nbsp; When Ludendorff later publicly reversed his position
about Germany's ability to continue the war, the Kaiser demanded his resignation.

<P> Ludendorff's post-war career tarnished his reputation.
Fearing revenge, he fled temporarily to Sweden.&nbsp; He wrote his memoirs,
blaming Germany's defeat on his innumerable foes and their lack of will
power.&nbsp; He railed at the new Republic and his new enemies, the Jews,
Jesuits and Freemasons, whom he blamed for stabbing Germany in the back.&nbsp;
He became the darling of the extreme right, marching with Hitler during
the Beer Hall Putsch.&nbsp; In 1925 he ran for Reich President, polling
a mere 1%.&nbsp; His views and demons grew more extreme, and he fell to
bickering with Hitler and his former wartime comrades.&nbsp; One-by-one
he broke relations with his staff and colleagues, including his wife whom
he suddenly left for Mathilde v. Kemnitz, a folklore specialist. She encouraged
his fantasies.&nbsp; In 1935 he published The Total War, reversing Clausewitz's
dictum and arguing that politics must
 serve war.&nbsp; On 22 December 1937 he died, shortly after declining
Hitler's offer of promotion to field marshal with the remark, "a field
marshal is born, not made."

<i>Reference</i>
<br>Ludendorff, Erich, <I>Ludendorff's Own Story, August 1914-November 1918</I>,
2 vols., New York, 1919, gives a flavor of the man.&nbsp; It bears careful
reading, for Ludendorff passes the blame for
Germany's defeat onto others.
