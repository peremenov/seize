        Irene Tabor bought their custom-built house on Mason Avenue in 1957. There, 
        in the McNeil neighborhood, they raised their family. "We moved in just 
        before Roger was born," Irene says. "In back of us was the desert, some 
        barns and horses. And there was a big gap between us and Downtown." Over 
        the years the barren land became rich with vegetation--and lush with friendships.</font>

        a place on Mason, they had to settle for Westleigh Avenue, several blocks 
        away. "It was as close as we could get," Irene says. In their absence, 
        the old neighborhood had become very popular. The Tabors found their children 
        and friends of their children moving in. They saw a lot of new faces.

      <font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bounded by Charleston 
      and Oakey, and stretching west from Rancho to about Cashman, McNeil was 
      one of the city's first westward suburban "sprawls." Now it's pretty much 
      in the heart of town, just a mile or so southwest of the Union Pacific plot 
      that city leaders see as the key to Downtown revitalization. And while the 
      Tabors are seeing a lot of re-energizing activity in McNeil, it's not the 
      high-density infill city officials talk about. These are single-family homes 
      on big, quarter-acre lots. The folks moving in aren't exactly yuppies--they're 
      a bit older now and raising young kids. But in Vegas, where "new" is de 
      rigueur, and where the new-housing market leads the universe, there actually 
      are people buying old homes in an old neighborhood close to the city center. 
      </font> 
      <p> <font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They are 
        buying inexpensively, spending big bucks to remodel, renovate, retrofit 
        and add on. For what it's costing them, most could have had new custom 
        homes in the 'burbs. But they're drawn to McNeil by the individuality 
        of the houses, the mature landscaping and larger yards, the proximity 
        to work, the challenge of renovating old homes and the sense of neighborhood. 
        Most buyers are natives, and some grew up in the neighborhood, have lived 
        elsewhere and are now drawn "back home" to raise their own families.<br>

      <font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"There are 580 
      houses in the neighborhood, and only seven or eight on the market right 
      now," says Realtor Debbie Zois of Debbie Zois &amp; Associates. Arriving 
      from Canada 15 years ago she found it to be "the only older neighborhood 
      that's still well-maintained." She soon began a monthly "McNeil Update" 
      mailer that lists offerings and recent sales. The homes, mostly ranches, 
      typically cost $160,000-$180,000 for about 2,500 square feet. Buyers, Zois 
      says, are often professionals, drawn by the ease of commuting to the University 
      Medical Center/Valley Hospital complex, Downtown, the business area, the 
      county center and the Strip.</font> 
      <p> <font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Today, old-timers 
        living in '50s and '60s houses mix neatly with a revitalizing element 
        that has brought babies and speed bumps. Some have moved here to downsize, 
        and content themselves with updating the insides. Some are using the lot 
        size to expand the houses for growing families. A few, asserting individuality, 
        are changing the exterior style of their homes.<br>

      <font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A drive through 
      the grid of tree-lined streets elicits a time-warp feeling and reveals a 
      striking variety of well-kept dwellings. Some still have the early wood 
      shake or white stone roofs, others the more modern tile or asphalt. Some 
      homes still have carports; at others, the homeowners have enclosed them 
      as garages or incorporated them into the living quarters, then built new 
      carports or garages. For new buyers, among the first things to go are the 
      '70s period details. "The avocado carpeting, the turquoise and gold appliances--they 
      just don't cut it anymore," Zois says.</font> 
      <p class=s4> <font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        rejuvenation of McNeil may have begun as early as 1985, when newlyweds 
        Bob and Mary Apple purchased a brown ranch-style house on Strong Drive. 
        They had often jogged through the neighborhood in search of the right 
        place. What they found was a 1962-vintage home with an interior that had 
        been "upgraded" to 1970s corkboard and shag carpeting. The roof was still 
        wood shakes. "They needed repair," says Bob Apple, a local attorney, "but 
        I wanted to wait and replace them with red tile as part of a major remodel. 
        So I would go up and staple visqueen on it during the rains."<br>

      <font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A self-described 
      "weekend warrior," he set to work on minor projects: moving walls, enclosing 
      the patio, vaulting a ceiling, remodeling the kitchen. ("Since my wife is 
      an artist, I had to change the window in the kitchen three or four times.") 
      The major project came in 1992, when the ranch was completely transformed 
      into a lovely Spanish-style house, inspired by the architecture of Santa 
      Barbara. The tile roof covered an added 1,000 square feet, including a new 
      master bedroom and bath. Apple also built a bell tower and removed the curved 
      driveway so he could convert the front yard into an enclosed courtyard. 
      </font> 
      <p> <font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Down a couple 
        of houses and across the street, a bright white picket fence encircles 
        the Cape Cod home of Bill and Heather Coulthard. Bill had grown up in 
        the nearby Rancho Circle area, and the couple had tried life in a new 
        country club community in the far northwest. They found that the commute 
        (to Bill's law offices on Howard Hughes Parkway) was "not very nice," 
        that the houses "all look alike," and they missed sidewalks. "In the newer 
        neighborhoods you end up walking in the streets," Heather says. So they 
        moved to McNeil in 1992. "Here there is a lot of activity--kids riding 
        bikes, people walking their dogs, mothers with strollers in the mornings." 
        </font> 
      <p> <font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/feature_house_Tabor-Bath.jpg" width="200" height="228" align="right">The 
        previous owner had converted the attic of the bungalow to living space, 
        but the home was a real patchwork, Heather says. "There were 17 different 
        floor coverings. The family room had been the garage, the bar had been 
        the patio." First, they gutted the kitchen and laundry area: out with 
        four layers of wallpaper, pink formica counters and 40-year-old appliances. 
        Project number two, completed this year, meant re-doing the family room 
        so they could enjoy time with their two young children. And they added 
        the white picket fence. </font> 
      <p> <font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The contractor 
        for Coulthard's projects was Tom DeBoard, who has found work in the McNeil 
        neighborhood to be a budding subspecialty. He's done more than a half-dozen 
        remodeling and retrofitting projects there in four years. "These people 
        have looked at new houses," he explains, "and for comparable footage they're 
        getting a better deal here." He's been modernizing, updating kitchens 
        and baths, and, especially, enlarging. "They want more space," he says. 
        "And they are absolutely opening the spaces more and lightening them." 
        </font> 
      <p> <font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/feature_house_CoultharotInt.jpg" width="200" height="208" align="right">DeBoard 
        has just opened up the kitchen in the home owned by Roger Tabor and his 
        wife, Amy. It's the latest of their three projects since buying the ranch 
        on Ashby nine years ago. The kitchen/family area, Amy says, had "carpeting 
        coming up over a bench and table, and a fake fireplace with plastic logs 
        and a red light." Now a sleek and efficient culinary island overlooks 
        the great room--where the three children can watch a G-gauge train circle 
        the perimeter on a ledge below the raised ceiling.</font> 
      <p> <font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Built in 
        1954 with 1,200 square feet on a huge corner lot, the house has maintained 
        its ranch character while climbing to nearly 5,000 square feet. A major 
        expansion four years ago provided a three-bedroom wing for the children, 
        as well as a high-ceilinged greenery-and-glass master bath that segues 
        to a yard of lush foliage, pool and entertainment area with built-in grill.

        an investment adviser, has pondered the financial end of their plan: buy 
        relatively inexpensively, upgrade and enlarge as family needs grow. The 
        total investment may or may not be reflected in the new market value, 
        but it will be close. Meanwhile, the intangibles--quality of life, the 
        community--make it worthwhile. "Instead of spending all kinds of money 
        on commissions and costs while buying and selling as you move up, you 
        can grow with the house," Roger says. "We've saved a lot of money."</font> 
      <p> <font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Roger lives 
        a stone's throw from where he was raised. "A lot of the kids are coming 
        back," says his mother, Irene. "Our daughter is back now, too, and several 
        of Roger's friends." Amy quickly names about 10 couples in the area who 
        live in homes that once belonged to a parent. </font> 
      <p> <font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Mark Stewart, 
        one of Roger's childhood chums, bought a 1959-vintage ranch house on Strong 
        Drive five years ago, and soon spent time and money redecorating. Gone 
        is the dark paneling and wallpaper; in is a lighter, "cleaner" decor. 
        Now he's wrestling with a major project, or perhaps a string of them. 
        "What I'm about to do, I've wanted to do for some time," says the certified 
        public accountant. "But it's a balancing act--how much to do, at what 
        cost, when."<br>

      <font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Working within 
      the 2,700 square feet of his house, Stewart plans to address a few problems. 
      Because the only bathrooms are in the sleeping area, he will convert utility 
      space into a privy and shower near the family room. Because he has no formal 
      dining area, part of the living room will be reconfigured into one. Because 
      he likes wine, the old carport--which has already been converted into a 
      garage, and then a laundry room--will be insulated and air-conditioned to 
      accommodate a "wine cellar." And because he has modern tastes, the formica 
      countertop and gold sliding-door shelves will be removed from the bar area/family 
      room.</font> 
      <p> <font size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Then there's 
        the kitchen, a wonderful old galley with birch cabinetry. He plans to 
        conceal the kitchen from the front entry, open it up to the rest of the 
        house, refinish the cabinets and add new countertops, wood flooring and 
        appliances.</font>

        on Stewart's list: the back yard--add a built-in grill, change the dog 
        run to a greenhouse. It is evident that he has caught the contagious excitement 
        of creating something new within the old. "I have a lot of respect for

      about moving, maybe to Summerlin. "But it would just be too far away," Bob

      <p align="left" class=s7><font color="#000000" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        McNeil neighborhood's street names are reminders of Las Vegas history: 
        Cashman (businessman, civic leader), Cahlan (founder / editor of the <i>Las 
        Vegas Review-Journal</i>), Ashby (Union Pacific president), Campbell (realtor/developer). 
        Then there's Mason, named after a supervisor for the McNeil Construction 
        Company, which built the Basic Magnesium plant, the original Basic Townsite 
        neighborhood (later incorporated as Henderson) and the Huntridge Addition 
        surrounding Maryland Parkway. </font> 
      <p> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Larry 
        McNeil platted his new development in the no-man's land west of the Union 
        Pacific property and southeast of the springs in 1947. According to Frank 
        Wright of the Nevada State Museum and Historical Society, the first model 
        opened in 1949, and UP executive Frank Strong moved in (presumably on 
        the street named for him) soon after. </font> 
      <p> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Miriam 
        Belmont was secretary to the president of Bonanza Airlines, Edmund Converse, 
        at the time. "One evening we were having a company party and Larry (also 
        a Bonanza board member) wasn't too happy because there was no action in 
        the tract," she recalls. "We were all young--pilots, mechanics, office 
        people. Larry said that the first couple that had a baby in the group 
        would get a free lot, and any of the rest of us would get 25 percent off 
        if we would build a home within a year. Turned out that the Halls were 
        already pregnant." Richard Hall, Bonanza's chief pilot, was quick to take 
        the offer. So did Miriam and her husband, Edwin, an insurance adjustor 
        and later investigator for the Gaming Control Board.</font> 
      <p> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        Belmonts paid a discounted $1,250 for one of the smaller lots, just under 
        a half acre. In early 1950 they moved into their new $10,000 ranch house 
        on Campbell. "The minimum size required was 1,250 square feet, and that's 
        what we built," she says. Over the years, as their family grew, three 
        major add-ons more than doubled its size. </font> 
      <p> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        original McNeil tract was modest, from Charleston to Ashby and Strong 
        to Cashman. The kids would go out the door and into the desert to hunt 
        jackrabbits, chipmunks and snakes, Belmont recalls. "My mother asked, 
        'Why did you buy that lot way out there? You will never have any neighbors.'" 
        But, later in the '50s, McNeil built luxury-type spec houses on the large 
        lots of Ashby, and the neighborhood blossomed. "We thought it was an address 
        we could really be proud of," Belmont says, "and it never changed."</font> 
      <p> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
        Over the years, several builders created a variety of housing within seven 
        different subdivisions. Fred and Irene Tabor bought their home on Mason 
        in 1957, a custom-built four-bedroom, two-bath for $36,500. He was a stage 
        electrician and she "worked wardrobe." During their stay in McNeil, they 
        came to own and operate the Chevron station at Charleston and Rancho, 
        Downtown's El Portal Theater and two drive-in theaters. </font> 
      <p> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Others 
        followed. Bob Johnston, who owned Las Vegas Furniture and then the House 
        of Lamps, had his house on Strong built in 1962. Notables such as entertainer 
        Sonny King and longtime school superintendent Guild Gray were early residents. 
        </font> 
      <p> <font color="#000000" size="3" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Miriam 
        Belmont stayed for 45 years. The Tabors tried retirement in California 
        but returned. Bob Johnston and wife Bobby are still there. "It was the 
        first upgraded neighborhood west of the railroad tracks," he says, "and 
        the neighborhood has remained good forever." </font>
