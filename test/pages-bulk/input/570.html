		<p>We're trying out a new location this year. New club-member Randy Word has a big ranch down near Granbury, and he's graciously allowed us to hold our shindig there. There's plenty of back-to-nature stuff to do there (hiking, fishing, etc) and lots of great activities for kids. Randy has also offered to smoke a batch of ribs for us, so we'll have plenty to eat and do.</p>
		<p>We'll likely be having a gift-exchange, so <strong>bring along a wrapped gift worth under $10 if you'd like to participate</strong>.</p>
		<p>It also looks like we're going to have a bigger-than-average group of young kids there, so if you bring along a wrapped toy (please keep it in the under-$5 range), we'll try to do a gift exchange for the kiddos. If your kid is older than about 8, the grownup exchange would probably be better.</p>
		<p><strong>What: </strong>Metroplex Atheists Infidels Bash</p>
		<p><strong>When: </strong>Sunday, December 17, noon until whenever (Randy has a fire-pit and cabins if we spend too much time partying) </p>
		<p><strong>Who:</strong> YOU! Okay, anyone who's ever been faced annoyance or condemnation for not following majority-owned holidays. We'll celebrate any winter holiday you'd like.</p>
		<p><strong>What To Bring: </strong>Randy will be smoking ribs and sausages, but we'll need any further fixins. If you'd like to bring some chips or soda or dessert or such, email <a href="mailto:director@metroplexatheists.org">director@metroplexatheists.org</a> and I'll help coordinate snacks so we don't end up with twenty bowls of dip and no chips.</p>
		<p><strong>BYOB </strong></p>
		<p><strong>Where:</strong></p>
		<p>Take 377 SW from I20 in SW Fort Worth towards Granbury (Benbrook exit).</p>
		<p> Stay on 377 thru Cresson and on to Granbury, take 377 Business to   downtown Granbury (the square with large rock courthouse).</p>
		<p> Go to the end of the square (1 block) and turn right on Hwy 4.</p>
		<p> Go thru town and then Hwy 4 angles/turns to the left immediately upon   crossing the RR tracks.</p>
		<p> Continue on Hwy 4 to Thorp Spring.  Stay on Hwy 4 to far end of town   and look for FM 2580.    Stay straight on Hwy 4 but immediately check your odometer.  Go   exactly 4.5mi from 2580 intersection to the turn into the ranch.    There will be a street sign there that says "Ruff Country".  You can   only turn right so turn right onto Ruff Country (gravel road)</p>
		<p> Again check you odometer and go exactly 0.9mi There will be an open   steel gate on your right.  There is a green street sign attached to   the gate that says "Randy Rd".  Turn right and you are now in the   ranch.</p>
		<p> Continue another 3/4mi on gravel/dirt road that will twist and turn   and go down a steep hill and eventually across a creek.  Don't give   up, if you take a wrong turn inside the ranch just keep driving and   you will find it.</p>
