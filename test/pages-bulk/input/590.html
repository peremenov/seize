<P><BLOCKQUOTE>Thanks to everyone who responded to the recent Pay Equity Survey.  The preliminary data from the survey,
combined with data from the Massachusetts Teachers Association (MTA), indicate that the districts listed below currently
have pay equity (defined as nurses employed full-time by a school district having the same salary schedule as the teachers
and other professional support personnel in that specific district).  <BR>
<BR>Please review this list.  If you think that any of the
data is incorrect or if you have additional districts to add, please contact Barbara Connolly at <A HREF="mailto:connnolly@msno.org">
connolly@msno.org</A>.  We received some conflicting data.  Pay equity committee members may be contacting you to verify
information.  The data collection and analysis continue and complete results will be available later in the year.

<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
We lost our case on the Appeals Court level.  After the decision of the Superior Court I guess that was expected, but 
still very disappointing.   There was no hearing and no opportunity for arguments.  The Appeals Court just reviewed the 
case.  Neil Rossman, our attorney, was very disappointed as well.  He felt very strongly about our case and did an 
excellent job in presenting it, but the judges just did not seem to understand.  This is the end of the line for this case; 
however, the Swampscott case is still alive.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
       Even though we did not win in the courts, I think we should be proud of what we accomplished.  We brought a lot of 
attention to the issue.  When we began there were only 25 districts with equity and now there are nearly 90.  And many of 
the districts without equity have made huge strides in their salary scales.  I like to think that this progress is a direct 
result of our courage in initiating the lawsuit.  There is still a long way to go and the quest for equity will not end 
with this.  MSNO plans to continue to explore other avenues to achieve the pay equity goal.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>  
    Thank you to Ann Borges, Roberta Cobbett, Janice DiFillipo, Ann Greenbaum, Kathy Larson, Maureen Saunders, Joan Scheid, 
and Lee Thurston for their courage in joining me and MSNO in this suit.  Every school nurse in the state owes them a great 
deal.  And thanks also to each of you who so generously gave your financial and emotional support to this venture. 
 Please contact me if you have any questions or any new ideas. If you would like a copy of the Appeals Court decision,

Barbara Connolly at her msno.org e-mail address of any additions or

the same salary schedule as the teachers and other professional support personnel (i.e. guidance counselors, 
librarians, adjustment counselors, speech therapists, etc.) in that specific district.  This means that the school nurse 
can progress up all the steps (for seniority) and across all the columns (for education) that a teacher can.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><UL><FONT SIZE="4"> The following information summarizes the history leading up to this action:</FONT SIZE="4">
<BR>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>The Massachusetts Education Reform Act of 1993 amended the teacher certification act to include school 
nurses.  The position of "school nurse" in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is now defined by statute.  Despite the 
fact that since June 1993 school nurse certification requirements are equal to, and in some areas even more rigorous 
than, those for teachers and other non-classroom based educational support personnel, most professional school nurses 
in Massachusetts are denied compensation equal to other professionals employed by the school system.
<BR>
<P>It is MSNO's contention that the practice of salary inequities ultimately impacts the quality of health care 
delivered to students, since it is difficult  to attract and retain school nurses with expertise in critical thinking, 
decision making, program management, health education and counseling, program planning, and community outreach, when 
competitive salaries are not offered.
<BR>
<P>Groups of nurses in individual school systems have historically had little success in securing equitable  contracts.  
Despite the current statewide and national recognition of the positive impact  of school nurses on children's health, 
the expanded public health role of school nurses, and the need for their professional education, many of Massachusetts' 
school nurses report that they continue to feel undervalued, unempowered, and isolated.  In spite of their many 
attempts to campaign for adequate compensation, comparable to other professionals  in the school system, they have 
continuously been denied pay equity.
<BR>
<P>Consequently in September 1997 the Massachusetts  School Nurse Organization (MSNO) formed a "Pay Equity Committee" 
and began a statewide effort to address  the problem of school nurse salary inequities.
<BR>
<P>In January 1998 MSNO conducted a statewide survey that confirmed that only a small minority of the school districts in 
the Commonwealth pay school nurses on the same pay scale as their professional counterparts with equal educational and 
certification requirements. (The survey report, entitled <I>Report  on the Current State of Salary Inequities for 
Professional School Nurses in Massachusetts, </I> is available from MSNO.) The vast majority of school nurses in 
Massachusetts  are significantly under-compensated.
<BR>
<P>In November 1999 a complaint was filed in Essex County Superior Court.  Plaintiffs were Ann Greenbaum, RN and Roberta 
Cobbett, RN, school nurses  in the Swampscott Public Schools.  Defendants were the Chairman of the Swampscott School 
Committee, the Superintendent of the Swampscott School Department and the duly elected Swampscott School Committee.
<BR>
<P>On July 25, 2000 a lawsuit was filed in Suffolk County Superior Court by Attorney Neil Rossman, Civil 
Action No.  #00-3348-F.</BLOCKQUOTE></UL>

<P>Newspapers across the state remain interested in doing articles on school nurses generally and on the pay equity 
issue in particular.  Journalists are very willing to pay attention to nurses.  A recently published book entitled 
<U>From Silence to Voice: What Nurses Know and Must Communicate to the Public</U> by Bernice Buresh and Suzanne Gordon 
presents a practical guide that provides approaches to increase nurses' visibility and voice in the media.  We have 
found during this campaign for pay equity that the media is very interested in our issues.  Do not be intimidated. 
 Contact your local newspapers and cable stations to publicize the pay equity issue.  We need to be heard and each of

<P>On October 26, 2000 <U><I>The New Bedford Standard-Times</I></U> ran an article entitled "School Nurses Keep Busy" 
in which they featured the nurses in the Freetown/Lakeville School District.  
<BR>
<P>The South Weekly edition of <U><I>The Boston Globe</U></I> on Sunday October 8, 2000 carried a feature article 
entitled "School Nurses Demand More Pay."</U>  Nurses from Duxbury, Hanover and Freetown/Lakeville were spotlighted.  
On October 22, 2000 <U><I>The Boston Globe</U></I> published the following letter-to-the-editor, submitted by Barbara 
Connolly on behalf of MSNO, in response to comments made in the article by Hanover's superintendent of schools.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=4>Pay Equity for School Nurses</CENTER>
<CENTER>(Letter-to-the Editor)</FONT SIZE=4></CENTER>
<BR>
<BR>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>A book published in 1989 entitled <U>Just a Nurse</U> stated that "the public wants a nurse to be a warm, 
caring human being.  The intellectual acumen needed to practice professional nursing is rarely understood." This 
statement applies to school superintendents and school committees who rarely seem to recognize the role of school nurses 
and certainly do not seem to understand the "intellectual acumen" required of these nurses.
<BR>
<P>The practice of professional nursing by school nurses occurs within the complex and unpredictable setting of the 
educational institution, not in a medical facility.  A school nurse usually functions as a sole practitioner in her 
school.  <U> The Comprehensive School Health Manual</U>, published by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health in 
1995, reminds us that the comprehensive and expanding public health nature of school nursing practice demands an 
educational and skill level that enables the school nurse to meet the current health needs of the students and staff.  
Why then, do the majority of school districts in the Commonwealth continue to devalue the nursing profession by refusing 
to pay nurses on the same salary scale as teachers <B> and other non-classroom based educational 
support staff?</B>
<BR>
<P>It is the Massachusetts School Nurse Organization's contention that the practice of salary inequities ultimately 
impacts the quality of health care delivered to students, since it is difficult to attract and retain school nurses with 
expertise in critical thinking, decision making, program management, health education and counseling, program planning, 
and community outreach, when competitive salaries are not offered.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><UL>It appears that school districts which deny school nurses pay equity are violating the Education Reform Act's 
statement of nondiscrimination.  A summary of the issues in the lawsuit are as follows:
<BR>
<OL>
<LI>under the Education Reform Act school nurses are required to be certified like all other educational professionals 
and to have a bachelor's degree as a prerequisite to certification...
<BR>
<LI>school nurses are professional educators, as are all other non-classroom based educational support staff...
<BR>
<LI>under Education Reform school nurses are the legal equal of other certified educators...
<BR>
<LI>in spite of having to meet the same requirements as classroom teachers pay equity and professional standing are 
denied the school nurses...
<BR>
<LI>salary schedules for school nurses are much lower than all other educational professionals...</OL></UL>
<BR>
<P><UL>Also, the Education Reform Act states (Section 99 of Statutes of 1993, Chapter 71):
<BR><UL>
"All programs and actions  undertaken under the provisions of this act shall be conducted in a manner reflecting 
and encouraging a policy of nondiscrimination and equal opportunity for members of minority groups and women.  All 
officials...of any school department...shall take affirmative steps to ensure equality of opportunity in the internal 
affairs of such departments...Each school district department...shall adopt measures to ensure equal opportunity  in the 
areas of hiring, promotion,...rates of compensation and in-service training programs..."</UL>
<BR>
<P>The MSNO Board of Directors has voted to support this legal action to achieve pay equity for school nurses.  
More information will be forthcoming to every school nurse in the State regarding how they can lend their encouragement  
and financial support to this undertaking.</UL>

<P><BLOCKQUOTE>The MSNO Pay Equity Committee wishes to thank all who have contributed to the MSNO Legal Action Fund.  
In the short time since <IMG SRC="tn_gavelonbook_gif.gif" ALIGN=LEFT VSPACE=6 HSPACE=18> we have informed our 
membership and other school nurse colleagues of our legal action process and our need for funding this action, 
we have raised $17,000. The requested amount to contribute is $50.  Individual school nurses' contributions have 
ranged from $25 to $1,000.  We thank you profoundly!  Since we anticipate needing $50,000, we hope that those who 
have not yet contributed will do so soon.  <U>Everyone's</U> contribution is necessary if this legal action is to 
succeed.
<BR>
<P>We have had a wonderful show of support from local unions, with donations ranging from $50 to $500!  The MTA 
has been contacted by Linda Salmonsen, requesting that MTA contribute financially, as well as to encourage 
the support of the individual locals.  NASN's Legal Defense Fund and the Connecticut Association of School Nurses 
have also been most generous in contributing to our legal action.
<BR>
<P>With the filing of this legal suit, the MSNO Pay Equity Committee will post various sample letters that school 
nurses may use to request contributions from their local unions and/or friends of school nursing-either private 
individuals or organizations which have supported school nurses and school health services.
<BR>
<P>We will keep you posted as this legal action progresses.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><BLOCKQUOTE>Several local unions have made generous contributions to the MSNO Legal Action Fund, such as Lanesborough, Dighton-Rehoboth, Brookline, Hanover, Westford and Central Berkshire.  Ask your local if they have contributed.  Show them the information on this website or in your newsletter which describes the Pay Equity lawsuit.  Ask them to make a contribution to show their support financially.  We are planning   an "Honor Roll  of Contributing Locals" to show our appreciation for their support  for this legal action and for their school nurses.</BLOCKQUOTE>
