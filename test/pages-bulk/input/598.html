              <em>Space Station Science officer</em></font></p>
            <p><em>Ed Lu was NASA&#8217;s science officer on the Expedition 7 
              mission to the International Space Station from April until October 
              2003. He and cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko were the first two-person 
              crew to live board the Station following the loss of the Space Shuttle 
              Columbia in February 2003. The crew flew to and returned from the 
              Station aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket.</em></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
              <strong>On riding the Soyuz spacecraft</strong>:<br>
              &#8220;I had the pleasure to fly twice on the Shuttle, and I can 
              tell you the experience in Russia is very different,&#8221; Lu said. 
              &#8220;When you&#8217;re launching on the Shuttle, it shakes a lot. 
              It&#8217;s like driving over a dirt road at 40 to 50 miles per hour.&#8221; 
              The vibrations are caused by the Shuttle&#8217;s Solid Rocket Boosters. 
              Since the Soyuz rocket relies entirely on liquid-fuel engines, it&#8217;s 
              a much smoother ride. However, the Soyuz is a three-stage rocket, 
              and there&#8217;s a strong acceleration when the stages separate, 
              particularly the last one. &#8220;When that thing went, if felt 
              like we&#8217;d been kicked in the butt by a giant.&#8221; Another 
              difference was that he and Malenchenko were not allowed to carry 
              as much with them on the Soyuz for their 6-month stay. Landing was 
              also very different. For example, the Soyuz uses an ablative heat 
              shield, which means it burns up as the craft re-enters the atmosphere. 
              &#8220;I remember looking out the window watching pieces of our 
              ship burn off, which is normal, but it&#8217;s still a little bit 
              disconcerting,&#8221; he said. The Soyuz also uses a parachute attached 
              to the side of the spacecraft. When it opens, the crew is hanging 
              sidewise, spinning in a circle.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>On 
              the International Space Station</strong>:<br>
              &#8220;The Space Station is like a big tube now,&#8221; Lu said. 
              &#8220;It&#8217;s about the size of a large jetliner.&#8221; As 
              the Soyuz approached the Station, he said it &#8220;looked like 
              a small model. It really feels like you&#8217;re in a science fiction 
              movie.&#8221; With the smaller crew and fewer supplies coming up 
              from Earth, keeping equipment operational was an important part 
              of the crew&#8217;s duties. &#8220;We spent a lot of time working 
              on equipment,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Another thing we spent a lot 
              of time doing was exercise.&#8221; The exercise paid off&#8212;Lu 
              was one of the first American astronauts to return from a long-duraction 
              spaceflight with almost no loss in bone density and little loss 
              in muscle strength. The crew was given an &#8220;exercise prescription&#8221; 
              for the work-out they had to perform. &#8220;And, I did extra on 
              top of that on my own,&#8221; Lu said. &#8220;I came back with less 
              bone loss than anyone.&#8221; His experience will help astronauts 
              healthy when they begin making the long trips to other worlds. &#8220;When 
              we do fly to Mars or asteroids or far away locations, it will take 
              months,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It could even take years.&#8221; 
              Lu said he enjoyed his stay on the Station. &#8220;It was a blast 
              from start to finish. Towards the ending I was wishing it would 
              last a little longer. I wasn&#8217;t ready to come home yet.&#8221;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><img src="images/lu3.jpg" alt="Ed Lu" width="233" height="288" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">On 
              eating aboard the Space Station</strong>:<br>
              &#8220;The food up there is pretty good, actually,&#8221; Lu said. 
              However, while the food is tasty, it gets monotonous after a while, 
              much like eating at your favorite restaurant every night would be. 
              &#8220;For us, it&#8217;s 3 months before we get to eat somewhere 
              else.&#8221; That&#8217;s why the crew looks forward to the arrival 
              of the Progress cargo ship, carrying supplies from Earth. &#8220;It 
              is a welcome thing, because it brings fresh food.&#8221; Another 
              welcome delivery of the Progress is odors. &#8220;Space Station 
              has no smell whatsoever,&#8221; Lu said, explaining that, because 
              of the air circulation system, when you open a can of food, you 
              can smell it only for seconds before the odor is circulated away. 
              When the Progress docked, however, the astronauts could smell food 
              inside. &#8220;When you opened the valve up, before you actually 
              open the hatch, you could smell apples in the Space Station,&#8221; 
              he said. &#8220;We were looking at our watches (until it was time 
              to open the hatch). Those things tasted terrific.&#8221;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>On 
              playing the piano upside down in microgravity</strong>:<br>
              You can&#8217;t do it. When you&#8217;re upside down, &#8220;everything&#8217;s 
              reversed,&#8221; Lu explained. &#8220;If you ever try it, it&#8217;s 
              not as easy as it looks.&#8221;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>On 
              the view from the Space Station</strong>:<br>
              &#8220;With binoculars, you can see airplanes in flight,&#8221; 
              he said. &#8220;You can see individual buildings. I even have a 
              picture of my home. You can also see lots of craters on <img src="images/lu4.jpg" alt="The Moon" width="270" height="171" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right">the 
              surface of the Earth.&#8221; Lu showed us a picture he took from 
              the Space Station which showed the Moon and Mars next to each other 
              in a single frame. &#8220;This is one of my favorite pictures from 
              the mission, because it shows where we&#8217;re going.&#8221; Mars, 
              which was closer to Earth than it had been in 60,000 years when 
              Lu was on the Station, put on quite a show for the crew. Ordinarily, 
              it is difficult to see celestial objects from the Station while 
              the lights are on, since the crew&#8217;s eyes are adjusted for 
              the brighter conditions. &#8220;Mars was bright enough last summer 
              that it was always out the window,&#8221; he said, explaining that 
              it was visible even with the lights on.</font></p>

              being on a two-person crew with Malenchenko</strong>:<br>
              &#8220;I learned to like, believe it or not, Russian rap music,&#8221; 
              he said. &#8220;We got along great. We never had a single argument. 
              We think a lot a like.&#8221; He said that he and Malenchenko were 
              fortunate that they had similar philosophies about the mission, 
              and that they each worked to be a good crewmate.</font></p>
