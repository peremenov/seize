   <b>In Charge of 14 Tax Offices</b><br>
   &quot;Although I had not yet finished my NTTS course I was considered good enough to teach income tax for the ... Tax Service Company. This was my first
   encounter with tax work other than as an NTTS student. The next tax season I worked for the same company as an office manager with 4 tax preparers under my
   supervision. That season we did 50% more business than that office had done during the previous three years. 
    <b>The office won a prize for greatest increase in
   revenue of all city offices</b> and I won a prize for the highest average charge of all the employees in the city area. I also received mention for the largest
   number of business returns in my type of office. After the season I represented many of my company's clients at IRS audits and did other part-time work for
   them. The following season I was offered and accepted a position as acting assistant city manager and trouble shooter for 14 local offices.&quot;

        &quot;Being retired I know how hard it is to find enjoyable, helpful and 
        profitable employment - especially if you have been accustomed to 
        working with your head and not your hands ... I can't resist offering 
        the suggestion that you make a special effort to reach the vast army of 
        retired clerical workers, executives, etc. What a big favor it would be 
        to many of these people if they enrolled in NTTS. I know. I did and now 
        I'm happily employed as my own boss - I'm a tax consultant, thanks to 
        NTTS.&quot;<p align="right"><b>Ira Dunn, Birmingham, Ala.</b></p>

       &quot;It has been 11 years since I took your training course and it was a 
       fortunate step, even though I was an accounting graduate ... At first I 
       only did taxes on a part-time basis since I was working for someone else, 
       but when I was let go by my employer, I decided to go into business 
       full-time. This I have never regretted, and year after year I have 
       continued to grow ...&quot;<p align="right"><b>J.T., Palm Beach, Fla. </b>

       &quot;I would like to take this opportunity to say that due to your Federal 
       Income Tax Course I have established a flourishing practice. I am still 
       on a part-time basis, yet word of mouth advertising on the part of last 
       year's clients and no effort on my part has kept me busy so far this 
       year.<p align="right"><b>Samuel T. Boyd, Chesapeake, Va.</b></div>

       know I was slow in getting the exams in but I studied and read every 
       chapter until I felt that I really knew it. I want to thank you for your 
       patience and time ... I shall continue to keep in touch with you. I 
       worked last tax season and showed the results of studying your course. I

       &quot;This past tax season I had 1,350 clients in and did all the work myself.
