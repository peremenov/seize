<font color="#006600" face="Bookman Old Style">A Language <br>Policy for Wales</font></h1>
</font>

<font size="2">

<p>&quot;The language issue&quot; has long figured prominently in the politics 
of Wales.&nbsp; The issue is 
conventionally conceived in terms of the assertion of Welsh usage &quot;<i>against</i>&quot; 
English usage.&nbsp;Use of the Welsh language has become one of the hallmarks of 
Welsh nationalism, of the assertion of a Welsh, Celtic cultural identity to 
contrast with the conventions of an Anglo-Saxon &quot;English&quot; culture.&nbsp;It is true that the history of Wales has been scarred by the oppression of the Welsh language, and 
of Welsh speakers, by dominant English speakers.&nbsp; Similar linguistic polarities 
have scarred other European societies, in Belgium, Brittany, and the Basque 
provinces. Against that background, 
it is understandable 
that those opposing <i>rule from London</i> should have rallied around the 
traditional language of Wales.&nbsp;It is no accident that one of the most 
radical Welsh political groups should have been called <i>Cymdeithas Yr Iaith</i>, 
or <i>The Welsh Language Society</i>.<p><b><font color="#006600">A future language policy for Wales</font></b> 
should, however, be conceived in much broader terms: it should not be 
constrained by the narrow conflicts of Welsh and English speakers.&nbsp; Indeed, there is a 
parallel need for a UK-wide language policy to govern the use of multiple languages by the 
modern State and its 
agencies.&nbsp; As a modern multicultural society, the need is to adapt to the 
requirements of <i>multilingualism</i>, and move away from the conventions of a 
monoglot, or even bi-lingual, society. In a modern society like Wales, the need 
is for a new systematic treatment of the overall 
<i>process of communication by language</i>.<p>Language policy has two quite 
distinct dimensions, namely the personal and the communal.&nbsp; <p>
<font color="#006600"><b>I&nbsp;&nbsp; PERSONAL</b></font><p>
<font color="#006600"><b>The first principle</b></font>, already formulated at 
UK law for the purposes of criminal court proceedings, is that any person, when 
faced with the prospect of condemnation and punishment, is entitled to be heard 
and to make his defence <font color="#006600"><b><i>in his mother tongue</i></b></font>.&nbsp; 
It is for the Court, as part of the conduct of a fair trial, to ensure that 
satisfactory translation/interpretation facilities are available for that 
purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp; <p><font color="#006600"><b><i>That principle should be 
developed</i></b></font>, as the primary arm of any language policy, for it 
constitutes a universal human right, going far beyond rules regulating the use 
of Welsh or similar traditional languages. It applies with equal force to the 
foreign visitor accused of shoplifting in London's Oxford Street.&nbsp; Wherever any 
person is <i>engaged with</i> the modern State, for the purpose of either securing a 
benefit or avoiding a penalty, the mother-tongue principle should be assiduously 
upheld.<p><font color="#006600"><b><i>This &quot;mother-tongue&quot; principle</i></b></font> 
is already well established, as a matter of Common Law and Court practice.&nbsp; It 
should be explicitly extended, however, to all situations in which the individual
<font color="#006600"><b><i>either </i></b></font>faces potential adverse 
consequences <i>(e.g. including Customs or immigration investigations)</i> <font color="#006600"><b><i>or</i></b></font> 
stands to gain or lose a valuable public benefit, according to the outcome of the 
proceedings.&nbsp; <p><font color="#006600"><b>II&nbsp; COMMUNAL </b></font> <p>
<font color="#006600"><b>The second group of principles is communal, or collective, 
in character.&nbsp; For each society</b></font>, the functional need is for a 
three-way classification of languages, as deployed by the State 
within the 
boundaries of its territory.<ul type="circle">
  <li><font color="#FF0000"><b>First</b></font>: Every State needs, as a 
  prerequisite of a settled civic order, an <b><i>official language</i></b>.&nbsp; 
  This is the official language of State, the language of official 
  pronouncements, the language of statutory legislation, the language of 
  official public announcements and orders, of the creation of new obligations 
  and punishments and benefits.&nbsp;Experience suggests that there should 
  preferably be a <i>single official language</i>.&nbsp; Where states have two or more 
  official languages <i>(Ireland, Canada)</i> it is easy for differences of 
  interpretation to generate unnecessary complication, if not conflict.&nbsp;Under the Government 
  of Wales Act, it was initially intended to constitute both 
  English and Welsh as having <i>joint official language status, </i>but that 
  plan was abandoned at an early stage. </li> 
  </ul>
<p></p>
<ul type="circle">
  <li><font color="#FF0000"><b>Second</b></font>: Social convention and history 
  may support the identification of a <b><i>traditional 
  language</i></b>, a language of culture, learning and social intercourse, 
  which may be habitually spoken by a large number of citizens but which is not 
  the <font color="#006600"><b><i>official language</i></b></font>.&nbsp; Welsh 
  is a good example of such a traditional language, as is Gaelic in Ireland, and 
  Breton in Brittany.&nbsp; In this respect, a single State may accommodate 
  within its borders a range of different languages, at 
  provincial or regional level and it should be possible to accommodate such 
  differentiation within a provincial frame <i>(Catalan in Catalunya, Breton in Brittany, Cornish in 
  Cornwall)</i>.</li>
  </ul>
<p></p>
<ul type="circle">

  <li><font color="#FF0000"><b>Third</b></font>: All societies must now, given 
  the increased ethic and cultural diversity within each society, deploy a range of <b><i>communal 
  languages</i></b>, being languages other than the indigenous <i>traditional</i> 
  language, but which are spoken by significant numbers of migrants within their own communities, and 
  which may still be the mother-tongue of newly-arrived migrants or elderly residents 
  who have never been able to learn English satisfactorily.</li>
  </ul>
<p>Each State should spell out, by law, the scope of these different categories 
of language, and their administrative and political implications.&nbsp; In the 
UK, the need is for primary legislation, preferably without imitation to Wales.&nbsp; This essay sets out the principles upon which such 
legislation should be prepared.<a name="two"><p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Official Language</b></font></a><p>
The UK should designate a single <i>official language</i>, binding upon all its 
territories.&nbsp; All official 
statements and requirements, instructions given, benefits conferred should as a 
matter of constitutional law be required to be stated in the official language, 
and clearly expressed. This principle has been developed as a matter of Common Law, 
and is embodied in the principles of construction <i>(&quot;interpretation&quot;)</i> 
applied by the Courts in deciding the meaning of statutes and statutory 
instruments (i.e.<i> primary</i> and <i>secondary</i> legislation).&nbsp;






<font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

And in this sense, whether with express statutory provision or not, the
<font color="#006600"><b> <i>official language</i></b></font> of Wales is English.</font><p>This principle extends to public requirements issued under legislation, made 
by any arm of government, national, provincial or local: in a highly mobile 
society, the most common of these takes the form of highway signage, but the 
principle also applies to the conduct of all legal proceedings, both criminal 
and civil.&nbsp; A further vital feature of contemporary society is the 
informational leaflet, particularly in the welfare sector, and this may shade 
into binding or procedural or advisory administrative directives, affecting a 
citizen's position.&nbsp; All such &quot;official&quot; statements should be made in the 
official Language. The same should hold true of <i>official </i>public records 
of public proceedings, including parliamentary and Civil Service records; where 
any statement was made, in such proceedings, in any language other than the 
Official Language, the record should always carry an official translation.&nbsp; 
And in all cases, the <font color="#006600"><b><i>official language alone</i></b></font> should generate legal effect.<a name="two"><p>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>Traditional Language</b></font></a><p>For most parts of 
the UK, there is no language capable of contending for designation as a 
traditional language, other than English itself.&nbsp; But in Wales, the Welsh 
language is the traditional language, occupying a very distinctive position, 
historically, culturally and politically.&nbsp; This status has already been 
recognised by the Welsh language legislation, the provision of S4C television, 
and the work of the Welsh Language Board.&nbsp; Indeed, in some respects, this 
legislation has already conferred on the Welsh language greater currency than a 
traditional language should necessarily, as a matter of general principle, 
enjoy.&nbsp; <p>But the concept of a traditional 
language should be developed further, by way of new statutory entitlement.<ul type="circle">
  <li><font color="#006600"><b><i>Place names </i></b></font>should be designated in <b><i>either </i></b>the official <b>
  <i>or</i></b> the traditional language, but no other.&nbsp; Every place should 
  be accorded one name and one name only, whichever the language of choice. The choice of 
  language should be a matter for decision by the most relevant local authority: 
  Cardiff City Council should decide on the naming of Cardiff (either <i>Cardiff
  </i>or <i>Caerdydd</i>, but not both).&nbsp; For Dinas Powis, the relevant 
  Authority would be the Dinas Powis Community Council.&nbsp; </li>
  <li><font color="#006600"><b><i>Public facilities</i></b></font> could, at the 
  discretion of the relevant authority, also be designated in either language - <i>cemetery </i>or<i> mynwent, 
  school </i>or <i>ysgol, church </i>or<i> eglwys, museum</i> or<i> amgueddfa.</i></li>
  <li><font color="#006600"><b><i>Public Documents</i></b></font>: In the case of specific public documents <i>(whether bearing coercive 
  force or merely advisory)</i> the State should always, if properly requested 
  by a citizen to do so, make them available in the traditional language, as 
  well as the official language.&nbsp; There should be <u><i>no requirement</i></u> that all 
  public documentation should be made available in the traditional language 
  <i>(unless of course the mother-tongue principle were engaged)</i>.&nbsp; And the State should 
  have the residual power to determine a request to be vexatious or otherwise 
  without proper foundation.</li>
  <li><font color="#006600"><b><i>Active support</i></b></font> should be given by the State for the cultivation of the 
  traditional language, both within the educational system and otherwise. In 
  Wales, education authorities should make many more facilities available for 
  residents seeking to learn Welsh.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The relevant authority should always retain a jurisdiction to avoid 
  dual-language deployment where other overriding considerations apply.&nbsp; 
  For example, it is a dangerous and destructive feature of Welsh highway 
  signage that operational instructions are conveyed in <u><i>both English and Welsh</i></u>, 
  thus running the risk of confused perceptions in an environment where highway 
  safety should be the prime concern.<a name="two"><p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Communal Languages</b></font>&nbsp; <p>
  <font color="#006600"><b><i>The status of communal languages</i></b></font> 
  will increase in importance, as the incidence of international migration 
  increases, and new ethnic and cultural groupings become established within the 
  territory of each State.&nbsp; Procedures should be put in place for the 
  official designation of a language, 



within any territorial unit of governance,
  



<font color="#006600">



<b><i>as a communal language</i></b></font>.&nbsp; <p>
  



<font color="#006600"><b><i>For those speaking minority foreign languages</i></b></font>, 
  the two most important factors are bound to be (a) learning the official 
  language, and (b) benefitting from the mother-tongue principle.&nbsp; But if a 
  community became firmly established within any locality <i>(which is the 
  common experience of migrating groups)</i> their settlement should be 
  recognised in other ways.&nbsp; For example, cultural grant facilities should 
  be accessible for the cultivation of communal languages and cultures, and 
  individuals should have the right to call for public advisory documentation to 
  be made available in the communal language <i>(e.g. as many educational 
  authorities provide foreign-language translations of material relevant to 
  children's education)</i>.</a><p><b><i><font color="#006600">The Welsh 
  Assembly is well suited</font></i></b> to the development of a new statutory 
  framework, pointing the way ahead, internationally, for this dimension of UK 
  public life.&nbsp; Within the UK, it is only in Wales that the 



relevance of 
  these issues is widely perceived and 



understood.&nbsp; There should be no 
  question of any 



crude stand-off between the protagonists of English and the 
  



devotees of Welsh.&nbsp; The issue is a much more 



profound one, going to the 
  dignity and human rights of 



each individual within modern society.<p>

  with the promotion of 



a new UK Language Act, embodying the 



above principles.<p>

<h1> <b>A Language Policy for Wales </b> </h1>



<font size="3"> Response to Roger Warren Evans by Fabian Chris Castle <br>

Cji-castle@cymru.new.labour.org.uk</p> </font>



<font size="2"> RWE has offered us a reasonable attempt to reconcile 



Welsh peoples commonly-held assumptions, misapprehensions, 



prejudices and ignorance with his obvious goodwill towards non-English languages.  



However, assumptions misapprehensions, prejudices and ignorance are features of his essay. </p> 



<p> I will argue that these negative attitudes lead to a confusion of language and ethnicity.

 A confusion, which is the most disgraceful aspect of the 



language issue.</p>

 

<p><font color="red"><b><i> However, I wish to begin </i></b> </font color> with two more obvious examples of 



linguistic prejudice.</p>



<p> (1) In an otherwise liberal-minded article on languages and their 



value (<i>You are what you speak</i> <b> New Scientist</b> 30 November 02) a subtle 



pro-English linguistic chauvinism became evident. The 



linguist Slobin has done research into the way that a 



group of languages <i>(including English)</i> have colourful verbs 



which express movement in terms that are dynamic, full of energy. 



Other languages <i>(including Romance languages)</i> are described has having prosaic verbs and lacking colourful verbs. All these terms are value laden. Would it not be better to consider why English/Russian etc are so subjective in comparisons with objective Romance languages? Are French/Spanish etc really lacking?



In this context I ask readers to note RWEs use of the words 



devotee, protagonists, unnecessary complication, 



and [the] dangerous and destructive [bilingual] highway signage.</p>



<p>(2) My second example is Paul Starlings <b>Welsh Mirror</b>.  



Readers of <b>Planet</b> magazine will be aware of Patrick 



McGuinesss close readings of the<b> Daily Mirrors</b> Welsh edition.  



Patrick has shown that by carefully selective translation and 



omission the Mirror is conflating all Welsh Language activists 



and Welsh speakers with the most violent forms of nationalism, 



xenophobia, and nazi-ism. The<b> Mirror </b> is careful to 



separate decent Welsh-speakers from this, but in <b>



Mirror </b>terms these can only be those who are prepared to stay 



silent in the face of linguistic bigotry from any English 



speakers with negative attitudes towards Welsh. The true 



horror is that Labour HQ at Transport House Cardiff, 



and some Labour representatives, are implicated in this 



black propaganda.</font size> </p>





<h3><font color="red">Dimensions of Language Policy, as proposed by RWE, which

need to be reconsidered</font color> </h3>  <font color="green">



<font size="3"> Personal rights </font size> </font color> </p>



<p> <font size="2"> The mother-tongue principle could lead to unintentional 

but institutional racism. 



  Mother tongue denotes 



ones language of ethnic origin.  Many Sikhs may have 



Punjabi as their mother-tongue, yet English may be their 



language of choice, they may be more comfortable speaking 



English away from the home. Using their mother-tongue in 



dealings with the State, however, may be an important way for 



them to express their ethnic identity. A right to use Punjabi 



in relations with the State, if it is provided for one group, 



must be available for all who speak Punjabi  including Sikh 



converts who may be non-Aryan.  Punjabi in this case becomes a 



communal language, not an ethnic language. A close reading of 



RWEs essay will reveal that  ethnic language is a better 



description what he outlines. </p> <p>

English is my mother tongue,  but Welsh is my chosen communal 



language in dealings with the State (form filling, advice 



lines etc). This, for me, is an important signifier that I 



have reinstated the Cymreictod <i>(Welshness)</i> of my fathers 



family who were bullied and cajoled into raising their 



children as monoglot English speakers. </p>





<p> Welsh is likely to be my language of choice in Court if I ever 



feel it necessary to engage in civil disobedience. 



Speaking Welsh is a major component of my sense of identity but 



the language does not define my ethnicity in any way shape or form. 



I have argued long and hard in the welsh language media 



against arguments for "Cymreictod Ethnig" <i>(Ethnic Welshness)</i>.</p> 

























<font size="3"> <font color="green"> Communal/Collective rights </font color></font size>> </p>



<font size="2"> Whilst RWEs assertion, that two official and 



equal 



languages can cause problems in interpretation of legal 



documents, is correct, that is not sufficient to argue against 



making Welsh an Official Language.  I fail to see any logical 



reason or even argument against the creation of a <i>subordinate 



Official Language</i>status for Welsh.

English then would become the<i>primary Official Language,</i>  



and it alone would generate legal effect.  I also see no 



reason why other languages with a British or any other 



origin could not one day become<i> subordinate Official 



Languages</i> within British towns, counties or regions.</p> <p>



Turning to road safety, if problems exist due to linguistic 



problems with road signs, we need to seriously consider 



confiscating the cars and lorries of non-English-speaking 



drivers the second they reach Dover.  I accept that there is a 



problem with the design of bilingual road signage  the 



confusion is usually caused by alternating monoglot English 



and Welsh signage, or by changing the relative position of 



the two languages, sometimes with Welsh on top, sometimes English.  



But the only way to promote Welsh is to make it <i>visible,  and 



accepted as normal</i>.  Bilingual road signs and official documents 



are amongst the best ways to do this.  RWEs idea of a 



traditional language seems designed to make Welsh 



disappear from any areas that are not ethnically Welsh-speaking  



i.e. where the majority are Welsh-speakers born and bred. </p> <p>





More Welsh Assembly work must first be <i>carried out in Welsh</i>.  



More work must be done to assimilate non-Welsh speakers into 



their naturally Welsh-speaking communities.  Most importantly, we 



must tackle the economic and social problems which are 



linguistically cleansing the traditional heartlands of the 



Welsh language. These processes exist in many parts of Britain. 



Language difference however makes the effect more obvious in 



Welsh-speaking areas. </p> 



<p>

As a party, Labour must take a long, hard look at the provision of 

Social Housing. We must find ways of funding real council housing 

and consider modifying the right to buy. We must be prepared 

to acknowledge that in some cases property rights militate 

against the welfare of stable communities. </p>







<p>Language shift in Wales is an indicator of social 

processes which Labour is failing even to acknowledge - let alone 

deal with.  We are not, at present, protecting working-class 

young people throughout Britain - from Cornwall to Bournmouth

 to Oxford to Abersoch - anywhere, in fact, where the right 

to buy a pretty view, an executive development or a 

luxury apartment is more important than the 

welfare of a community. </p>
