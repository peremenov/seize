                      a closely held corporation, shareholders are often concerned 
                      about what might occur if one of the owners dies. Will the 
                      deceased shareholder&#8217;s family retain the economic 
                      value of the corporate interest? Can the surviving owners 
                      avoid interference from the deceased shareholder&#8217;s 
                      family? Will the survivors have the economic resources to 
                      redeem the deceased owner&#8217;s interest? Given these 
                      concerns, corporate owners are best served by entering into 
                      a buy-sell agreement while they are all alive.</font></p>

                    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Owners 
                      usually choose from two basic types of buy-sell agreements. 
                      With a cross-purchase agreement, each owner of the corporation 
                      purchases an insurance policy on the other shareholders. 
                      The purchaser is both owner and beneficiary of the policies. 
                      Upon the death of a shareholder, the other shareholders 
                      are then able to use the life insurance proceeds to purchase 
                      the deceased owner&#8217;s shares. Another commonly used 
                      type of agreement is a stock redemption agreement, in which 
                      the corporation owns policies on the lives of the shareholders. 
                      When a shareholder dies, the corporation buys the deceased 
                      shareholder&#8217;s interest in the company with the insurance 
                      proceeds.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><em><strong>Cross-purchase 
                      agreements.</strong></em> The cross-purchase form of the 
                      buy-sell agreement offers several advantages. The family 
                      of the deceased owner will have a tax basis equal to the 
                      fair market value of the decedent&#8217;s stock at the date 
                      of death, thus avoiding any income tax consequences as a 
                      result of the sale. The fair market value of the shares 
                      should be defined by the buy-sell agreement (see the <a href="http://www.nysscpa.org/cpajournal/2004/604/images/p38.pdf" target="_blank">Exhibit</a>).</font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
                      life insurance proceeds received by the surviving owners 
                      are not subject to income taxation. For newly purchased 
                      shares, the corporate shareholders will be entitled to a 
                      tax basis equal to the purchase price. The stepped-up basis 
                      should reduce future income taxes if the surviving shareholders 
                      later sell their interests. The insurance proceeds are not 
                      subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) and 
                      are also not subject to the claims of corporate creditors. 
                      The AMT avoidance and creditor protection exist because 
                      the proceeds are paid directly to the individual shareholders.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
                      cross-purchase form of the buy-sell agreement carries several 
                      disadvantages. The plan is difficult to administer if there 
                      are numerous shareholders that must buy a plan for each 
                      other. For example, for seven owners to cross-purchase life 
                      insurance would require 42 (7 &yen; 6) policies. The number 
                      of policies can multiply even further if disability coverage 
                      is also part of the buy-sell agreement. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Another 
                      disadvantage of the cross-purchase agreement is that age 
                      or insurability can create a disparity in premiums. Younger 
                      or healthier owners may incur higher premiums to cover older 
                      and less healthy owners. A possible solution to this drawback 
                      is to have the corporation raise salaries to cover the premiums 
                      incurred by the owners. Inequities may persist, however, 
                      if owners&#8217; marginal tax rates applied to the salary 
                      reimbursements are different. Additionally, cross-purchase 
                      agreement adopters should recognize that the cost of funding 
                      the buy-sell agreement will be greater if the shareholders 
                      have a higher tax rate than the corporation.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><em><strong>Stock 
                      redemption agreements. </strong></em>Under a stock redemption 
                      agreement, the corporation owns policies on the lives of 
                      the shareholders. When a shareholder dies, the corporation 
                      buys the deceased shareholder&#8217;s interest in the company 
                      with the insurance proceeds. A prime advantage of the stock 
                      redemption agreement is that it is easier to administer 
                      for multiple shareholders. An additional advantage to the 
                      stock redemption structuring of the buy-sell agreement is 
                      that the corporation will bear the premium differences associated 
                      with age disparities among shareholders.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
                      corporation will not recognize income for tax purposes when 
                      it receives the insurance proceeds. The corporation must, 
                      however, heed the effect of the entire transaction (proceeds 
                      received and redemption accomplished) on the earnings and 
                      profits of the corporation. The earnings and profits will 
                      increase with the life insurance proceeds received and decrease 
                      as a result of the stock redemption, so the corporation 
                      must attend to the overall net effect on earnings and profits 
                      and consider how that might affect the dividend policy to 
                      shareholders. For example, in the Exhibit&#8217;s Scenario 
                      3, the corporation may have to issue dividends to avoid 
                      the accumulated earnings tax on earnings and profits, assuming 
                      that the reasonable needs of the business do not justify 
                      maintaining earnings and profits above the $250,000 credit 
                      (IRC section 535). These dividends would be taxed to the 
                      remaining shareholders at ordinary income rates.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">A significant 
                      disadvantage of the stock redemption form of the buy-sell 
                      agreement is that the remaining shareholders do not get 
                      the benefit of a step-up in basis when the corporation purchases 
                      the deceased shareholder&#8217;s interest. The continuing 
                      shareholders retain their original bases in the company. 
                      Compared to the cross-purchase agreement, the stock redemption 
                      structuring will create greater capital gains upon the ultimate 
                      disposition of shares if made before death. After the stock 
                      redemption is accomplished, however, the corporate assets 
                      should be relatively unchanged (the insurance proceeds have 
                      been used to purchase the deceased&#8217;s interest), but 
                      each owner now enjoys a greater percentage of ownership.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><em><strong>Estate 
                      tax implications.</strong></em> When a cross-purchase plan 
                      exists, the proceeds from the life insurance are not included 
                      in the deceased shareholder&#8217;s estate. The deceased 
                      is not the owner of the policy and, therefore, the insurance 
                      proceeds payable at death are not included in the estate. 
                      Under a redemption approach, however, the estate tax consequences 
                      can become more pronounced when the deceased shareholder 
                      has a controlling interest. A shareholder who owns more 
                      than a 50% interest either directly or indirectly is deemed 
                      to control a corporation, under IRC section 267. In this 
                      situation, the shareholder is deemed to have an ownership 
                      interest in the life insurance policy due to the shareholder&#8217;s 
                      ability to designate a beneficiary, as well as other ownership 
                      interests. The fact that control exists over the policy 
                      in majority ownership instances would result in the proceeds 
                      being includable in the deceased&#8217;s estate. Thus, the 
                      after-tax returns on life insurance policies can be substantially 
                      reduced if estate taxes are incurred as a result of the 
                      life insurance proceeds being included in the estate.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
                      the case of family-owned corporations, purchase prices specified 
                      by the buy-sell agreements are often disputed by the IRS 
                      as not representing fair value. If a corporation owns life 
                      insurance for the purposes of funding the redemption of 
                      the stock, and the deceased shareholder owns a controlling 
                      interest in the corporation, the probability that the life 
                      insurance policy will be included in the decedent&#8217;s 
                      estate is substantial. Note, however, that if the family 
                      members own the insurance policy on the decedent, they will 
                      receive the life insurance proceeds without including them 
                      in the taxable estate. Thus, the cross-purchase option may 
                      be preferable to the redemption option.</font></p>

                      Issues of Buy-Sell Agreements</strong></font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">There 
                      is a distinct difference between the values that should 
                      be established for the two alternative approaches to a buy-sell 
                      agreement. This difference is due to the ownership of the 
                      life insurance policy. In a cross-purchase agreement, the 
                      deceased shareholder has no economic interest in the life 
                      insurance policy on his life. Accordingly, the surviving 
                      shareholders should expect to pay the fair market value 
                      of the underlying net assets, which represents the value 
                      of the business operations.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Under 
                      the stock redemption approach, the corporation owns the 
                      policies, and therefore the value of the corporation includes 
                      both the business operations and the insurance policies. 
                      The redemption price of a buy-sell agreement should typically 
                      include a portion of the life insurance proceeds. If the 
                      stock redemption agreement is so structured, the tax implications 
                      may be negative, because the life insurance proceeds may 
                      be subject to both estate tax and income tax if the decedent 
                      is deemed to possess an ownership interest in the policy. 
                      Given these tax implications, including the value of life 
                      insurance proceeds in the buy-sell valuation price may result 
                      in an unsatisfactory after-tax return.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Another 
                      valuation issue is that the premiums on older shareholders 
                      can be considerably higher than the premiums on younger 
                      shareholders. As each unit of stock incurs the same cost, 
                      older shareholders will incur higher premiums than they 
                      would under a cross-purchase plan. Accordingly, younger 
                      shareholders expect to reap a greater benefit from the insurance 
                      policies than their older counterparts. Thus, younger shareholders 
                      would be entitled to a greater benefit at a lower cost under 
                      a stock redemption approach than for a cross-purchase approach.

                    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This 
                      scenario suggests that the redemption price should include 
                      a portion of the life insurance payments, unless older shareholders 
                      are compensated for the disparity in the premiums. This 
                      would convert potentially nontaxable deferred income into 
                      accelerated taxable income. It would also precipitate similar 
                      adjustments for the purchase price for younger shareholders. 
                      The proper pricing for a buy-sell agreement becomes much 
                      more complex in the case under the redemption alternative.</font></p>

                      of insurance.</strong></em> Any buy-sell agreement requires 
                      a decision regarding the type of insurance policy to purchase. 
                      The initial choice is between term and whole life insurance. 
                      Premiums for term life insurance increase throughout the 
                      coverage period, whereas premiums for whole life are level 
                      throughout the coverage period. If the shareholder dies 
                      in the first few years of coverage, the cost of term insurance 
                      will be less than the cost of whole life insurance. Conversely, 
                      the cost of term life may be much greater than whole life 
                      if an individual exceeds the life expectancy used for underwriting 
                      the whole life insurance policies. </font></p>

                      life insurance with cash value buildups can offer advantages. 
                      If policies are held for a significant number of years, 
                      the cash values of whole life policies can supplement pension 
                      benefits or help fund shareholder buyouts. Additionally, 
                      the policy&#8217;s cash value is a liquid asset of the corporation 
                      that may help secure advantageous loan terms for the company.</font></p>

                      may choose to forgo whole life insurance and purchase term 
                      insurance. The early premiums saved may be invested in the 
                      company to either reduce debt or promote growth. In favorable 
                      economic conditions, the return on investment will typically 
                      be greater than the earnings attributed to the cash value 
                      of the whole life policy. The possibility of premium savings 
                      in the event of premature death and the excess expected 
                      returns on premium differences invested are advantages for 
                      term insurance.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
                      addition to cost, insurability is a key consideration. The 
                      ability to maintain life insurance throughout a shareholder&#8217;s 
                      life is important. Whole life insurance policies grant coverage 
                      until death that may not be cancelled by the insurance company. 
                      This feature has persuaded many that whole life insurance 
                      is the proper means to finance corporate buy-sell agreements. 
                      The term life insurance industry has, however, modified 
                      its products so that policyholders can purchase term life 
                      with the same benefit. This can be accomplished with either 
                      a guaranteed insurability option or lengthy (20- to 30-year) 
                      policy terms. The addition of a guaranteed insurability 
                      option to a term policy will increase the cost of the term 
                      insurance. The increased premium, however, will still be 
                      lower than whole life premiums in the beginning years. Owners, 
                      therefore, must weigh the escalating premium structure of 
                      term insurance against the early returns that might be realized 
                      by purchasing less-expensive term insurance and investing 
                      the premiums saved.</font></p>

                      time, the value of a successful corporation will grow. Assuming 
                      the buy-sell agreement ties the purchase price to fair market 
                      value, owners should ensure that additional life insurance 
                      can be acquired over time to keep pace with the increasing 
                      value of corporate shares. Typically, guaranteed insurability 
                      options (available on either term or whole polices) allow 
                      the policyholder to acquire additional life insurance at 
                      timed intervals.</font></p>

                      a shareholder dies, several issues arise with respect to 
                      policy ownership by the deceased and the remaining shareholders 
                      in the cross-purchase arrangement. The policies insuring 
                      remaining shareholders but owned by the deceased will carry 
                      beneficiary designations, generally family members. With 
                      whole life, the family inherits the cash surrender value 
                      of the policies. With no continued business purpose, and 
                      out of courtesy to the surviving shareholders, the surviving 
                      family beneficiaries may choose to cash out the value of 
                      the policies. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Under 
                      a cross-purchase approach, the death of a corporate shareholder 
                      will not diminish the value of the enduring corporation. 
                      Because individuals and not the corporation hold the life 
                      insurance policies, the receipt of death benefits or cash 
                      values by the policy beneficiaries will not decrease the 
                      assets of the corporation. This fact does, however, create 
                      a funding issue for the remaining shareholders. The remaining 
                      cross-purchased policies will likely not cover the continuing 
                      value of the business. The surviving shareholders may need 
                      to address the shortfall by purchasing additional insurance 
                      if other funds are not readily available.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">An 
                      alternative to purchasing additional insurance would be 
                      to use term life insurance to fund the buy-sell agreement. 
                      The value of a term life policy is normally equal to the 
                      unearned premium for the year of death, usually very small 
                      in comparison to whole life insurance. Given this low value 
                      of term life insurance, shareholders should consider purchasing 
                      term insurance as joint tenants with rights of survival. 
                      The insurance policies could then transfer from the deceased 
                      shareholder to the surviving shareholders without triggering 
                      the recognition of income upon the death of the insured.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><em><strong>Uninsurable 
                      shareholders.</strong></em> The preceding discussion has 
                      assumed that the shareholders can obtain new insurance policies 
                      on each other. Some individuals, however, may not be insurable 
                      at the time that the buy-sell agreement is adopted. In this 
                      case, the only alternative is to use an existing policy 
                      of the uninsurable shareholder. Such shareholders hopefully 
                      own whole life insurance policies on their lives that have 
                      appreciated in value. A shareholder will typically expect 
                      to be compensated for the cash surrender value of the policy 
                      upon transferring it to either the corporation or fellow 
                      shareholders. The most important factor in determining which 
                      party to sell the policy to is the tax treatment afforded 
                      when the insurance proceeds are ultimately received. If 
                      the corporation purchases the policy, the insurance proceeds 
                      will not be taxable; if the shareholders purchase the policy, 
                      the insurance proceeds will be taxable. The shareholders 
                      must weigh the tax advantages of the corporate stock redemption 
                      against the tax advantage of using a cross-purchase buy-sell 
                      approach. If a policy must be purchased because there is 
                      an uninsurable shareholder, the issues are the same as previously 
                      discussed except that now the shareholders that have purchased 
                      the uninsurable&#8217;s policy must pay taxes when the proceeds 
                      are received. Recall that although the insurance proceeds 
                      will be nontaxable to the corporation when the life insurance 
                      proceeds are received, the remaining shareholders must weigh 
                      this benefit against the fact that they will not receive 
                      a step-up in basis upon the death of the noninsurable shareholder. 
                      Accordingly, as the percentage of stock owned by the uninsurable 
                      shareholder increases, the likelihood that a stock redemption 
                      buy-sell agreement is preferable increases.</font></p>

                      without life insurance policies.</strong></em> Although 
                      risk-averse shareholders generally prefer to fund buy-sell 
                      agreements through the purchase of life insurance, not all 
                      shareholders are risk averse. Risk-seeking shareholders 
                      have two alternatives: to invest capital in life insurance 
                      to fund the buy-sell agreement, or to invest to grow (or 
                      perhaps to sustain) the corporate business operations. If 
                      capital funds are limited, shareholders may not have the 
                      luxury of funding both alternatives. </font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Actuaries 
                      typically base premiums on a relatively low rate of return 
                      to the insured. If it were not for the favorable tax treatment 
                      provided by life insurance proceeds, few would use life 
                      insurance as an investment. In contrast, the return on corporate 
                      business operations, especially in the early years, may 
                      yield substantially greater returns than those offered through 
                      life insurance. Thus, risk-seeking shareholders may reason 
                      that if they live at least as long as their actuarially 
                      determined life expectancy, the return on capital invested 
                      should be greater for funds invested in the corporation. 
                      Another reason not to fund the buy-sell agreement is that 
                      buy-sell settlements often occur at the date of retirement&#8212;not 
                      at death&#8212;leaving no need for life insurance to fund 
                      the settlement.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Shareholders 
                      that decide not to fund settlements with life insurance 
                      typically expect that corporate earnings and profits will 
                      increase as the corporation matures. In such situations, 
                      C corporations often must pay dividends to avoid the corporate 
                      accumulated earnings tax. Alternatively, corporations may 
                      elect S status, whereby earnings flow through to shareholders 
                      and are taxed then at the individual shareholder level. 
                      Either way, shareholders will likely incur increased taxes. 
                      Regardless of the corporate form, earnings may be strategically 
                      accumulated so they can fund needed buy-sell settlements. 
                      When the corporation executes the buy-sell agreements, the 
                      estate of a deceased shareholder will receive the proceeds 
                      for selling the stock without incurring income taxes (the 
                      share basis will be the fair market value at the date of 
                      death). If the buy-sell agreements are executed at the date 
                      of retirement, not at the date of death, retired shareholders 
                      will benefit from capital gains treatment. Buy-sell agreements 
                      should specify an installment purchase option (rather than 
                      the immediate purchase of shares) where time might be needed 
                      to accumulate funds for the redemption of the stock (e.g., 
                      upon the sudden death of a shareholder).</font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><em><strong>Combination 
                      funding of the buy-sell agreement.</strong></em> Shareholders 
                      that are more risk averse may choose a combination approach 
                      to funding the buy-sell agreement. A portion of the buy-sell 
                      agreement can be funded with life insurance to guard against 
                      premature deaths, with the remainder funded by accumulated 
                      earnings and corporate profits. For example, shareholders 
                      could initiate a buy-sell arrangement to purchase 80% of 
                      the stock through a cross-purchase agreement (with funding 
                      provided by life insurance), and 20% of the stock would 
                      be redeemed by the corporation upon the death of a shareholder. 
                      Alternatively, shareholders may opt to initially fund 100% 
                      of the buy-sell agreement with a cross-purchase design funded 
                      by insurance. The funding of the agreement can then change 
                      annually, with the corporation assuming responsibility for 
                      purchasing any incremental increases in shareholder value 
                      as the corporation grows. This approach eliminates the need 
                      for shareholders to increase the amount of life insurance 
                      over time. It also provides assurance to the shareholder&#8217;s 
                      family that it will receive a minimum amount whether or 
                      not the corporation can generate the funds needed for the 
                      buy-sell arrangement.</font></p>

                      combination approach may be especially appropriate for family 
                      corporations. Tax law limits the amount of stock purchased 
                      by the corporation that can be classified as redemption 
                      instead of as a dividend to the sum of the estate, inheritance, 
                      legacy, succession taxes, generation-skipping taxes, and 
                      funeral and administrative expenses allowable as deductions 
                      to the estate of the deceased. Share value in excess of 
                      IRC section 303 limitations may be purchased with life insurance 
                      proceeds. The basis of this purchase will be the fair market 
                      value of the shares at the date of death. To remove the 
                      value of the remaining shares from the deceased shareholder&#8217;s 
                      estate free of taxes, the buy-sell agreement should provide 
                      a member of the family an option to buy the stock from the 
                      estate. The family member may then choose to exercise the 
                      right to purchase remaining shares, as determined by the 
                      IRC section 303 limitations. The combination approach (part 
                      corporate redemption, part family member purchase) can result 
                      in the total value of the deceased&#8217;s corporate shares
