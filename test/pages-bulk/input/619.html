                  <p><b>Subject:</b> Leviticus 18.22; 20.13 <br>
                  </p>
                  <p> It's another month, and OPERATION: REBIRTH is still making 
                    progress. This Bible Study alone is helping so many people; 
                    it's hard to keep up with the "thank you" emails we get. We 
                    thank God for the opportunity to invest into the lives of 
                    people all over the world. It's not a responsibility we take 
                    lightly. We consider it a blessing, not a burden to do the 
                    work that we have been able to do. We also look forward to 
                    continuing the work of speaking life, healing and truth. </p>
                  <p>This month we will be dealing with two of the most quoted 
                    scriptures people use in their stance against the same-gender 
                    loving community. Leviticus 18.22 says <b>"Thou shalt not 
                    lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination."</b> 
                    And Leviticus 20.13 says <b>"If a man also lie with mankind, 
                    as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: 
                    they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon 
                    them."</b> On the surface, it's a closed case. With a literalist 
                    interpretation of this scripture, the act of same-gender sex 
                    is wrong, and in the eyes of God is punishable by death. We 
                    will delve deeper into this issue and "take a closer look" 
                    at this scripture. Hopefully, those who read will be enlightened 
                    and liberated from church imposed guilt and shame. So, let's 
                    begin… </p>
                  <p>When looking at the "Levitical Holiness Code", we must understand 
                    that it was a code of conduct that was part of a covenant 
                    that required the children of Israel to not participate in 
                    the religious rituals of the Canaanites once they entered 
                    the land God promised to them. They were to remain separate 
                    in every way. They were not to eat with the Canaanites, intermarry, 
                    worship with/or like them. They were to remain "holy" or set 
                    apart. In obeying this covenant, they would prove themselves 
                    to be God's chosen people. They would be instantly identifiable 
                    as the people of covenant. This same code also prohibits the 
                    eating of certain foods, wearing certain types of clothes, 
                    and also discriminates against people with disabilities as 
                    it relates to worship and the priesthood. </p>
                  <p>We must also remember that it was always in the forefront 
                    of the minds of the people of Israel the covenant made with 
                    their patriarch Abraham. God promised Abraham that he would 
                    make of him a mighty nation. A nation whose number would be 
                    like that of the stars in the sky or the sand of the sea. 
                    He would be the Father of many people….a great nation (Genesis 
                    17.5). So when making laws, or instituting a code of conduct 
                    that would govern their actions they had to keep in mind that 
                    God's covenant with the father of their faith was to make 
                    them a great nation. They could not participate in anything 
                    they thought would hinder or keep them from fulfilling that 
                    covenant.</p>
                  <p> In taking a closer look at these two verses, we will look 
                    at the transliteration from Hebrew to English. In taking each 
                    character of Hebrew into English, Leviticus 18.22 looks like 
                    this… </p>
                  <p><b>"V'et zachar lo tishkav mishk'vei ishah to'evah hu"</b>…when 
                    translated into English reads <b>"And with a male thou shalt 
                    not lie down in beds of a woman; it is an abomination."</b></p>
                  <p> Leviticus 20.13 looks likes this… </p>
                  <p><b>"V'ish asher yishkav et zachar mishk'vei ishah to'evah 
                    asu shneihem mot yumatu d'meihem bam"</b> when translated 
                    into English reads <b>"And a man who will lie down with a 
                    male in beds of a woman, both of them have made an abomination; 
                    dying they will die. Their blood is on them."</b> </p>
                  <p>We are going to look at the words "mishk'vei" and "to'evah" 
                    and it will give us a better understanding of what these verses 
                    are trying to say. First, the word "mishk'vei" is a noun. 
                    The main form of it is "mishkav, and the root letters of the 
                    noun, sh-k-v are the same letters of the verb root in the 
                    verse (lie down). Mishk'vei is in the plural construct state, 
                    meaning "beds of", and the noun "ishah" means woman. To'evah 
                    is translated "abomination" in English. Yet the definition 
                    is key to the interpretation of the verse. Most define this 
                    word as "disgusting" or "detestable". Others simply define 
                    it as "improper" or "unclean", as if to say "good Jews just 
                    don't do that". </p>
                  <p>With what we know now, the verse says a man cannot, or should 
                    not lie down with a man in the bed of a woman. During this 
                    time period, a woman was considered property. And since women 
                    were considered unclean during certain times of month, they 
                    had beds of their own. Other than the woman herself, nobody 
                    was permitted to sleep in her bed but her husband. Husbands 
                    often didn't sleep in the same bed with their wives unless 
                    they were there for the express purpose of having sex with 
                    them. And there were rules which said when he could do that. 
                    So this verse is more about WHERE same-gender sex could occur, 
                    and not about the sex itself. </p>
                  <p>Now just why would the author even bring this up? Well, the 
                    Canaanites' religious rituals or worship included sex acts. 
                    They worshipped fertility gods who were thought to bring blessings 
                    on their crops, livestock, children, etc. During these rituals, 
                    everyone participated. Even relatives would have sex with 
                    one another. They would also burn babies as sacrifice at the 
                    altars built to these fertility gods. And since incest, human 
                    sacrifice, and having sex anywhere was part of the worship, 
                    the Israelites were not permitted to perform these acts if 
                    they were going to be different and separated unto a Holy 
                    God. </p>
                  <p>The sex acts were prohibited because of religious reasons, 
                    more specifically idol worship. This law was not a blanket 
                    prohibition of sexuality. The entire code was meant to keep 
                    Israel from engaging in the religious practices of the Canaanite 
                    people. The argument here is religious, not moral or ethical. 
                    If the Jews of this time period were to maintain a strong 
                    identity, and build a large nation, they could not be like 
                    the people around them in any way or form….including their 
                    worship.</p>
