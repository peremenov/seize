  SOUTH LAND EXPLORATION LEASE </strong></font><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  </font></strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
  <p><font size="2"> <strong>Wednesday 24 November 2004</strong></font></p>
  <p><font size="2"><strong>Mr FINCH</strong> (Question) - Mr President, would 
    the Leader reveal what, if any, plans the Government has for the future of 
    Great South Land's oil and gas exploration lease, SEL 13/98, which covers 
    the eastern half of Tasmania?</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">As the Leader will be aware the Australian Financial Review 
    reported on Friday that SEL 13/98 has just been renewed for a further five 
    years, effectively tying up half of Tasmania for oil and gas exploration to 
    an unlisted company whose chairman has stated that he is inspired by visions.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">As the conditions of the lease require a reported exploration 
    expenditure of $21 million, and Great South Land is reported to have capital 
    of less than $13 000, how soon can the State Government ensure more effective 
    exploration of lease SEL 13/98?</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">Mr Harriss - That would be on Mr Rattray's property, wouldn't 
    it?</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">Mrs Rattray-Wagner - I will pass that on.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">Mr AIRD - I thought you were going to make a land tax comment.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">Mr President, I thank the honourable member for his question. 
    The State Government is aware of Pierpont's article in last Friday's, that 
    is 19 November 2004, Australian Financial Review but has no comment to make 
    on the journalist's assessment on how a company is run.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">From the Government's position, Great South Land Minerals 
    Ltd - GSLM - was granted a special exploration licence for oil and gas exploration 
    over 30 356 square kilometres of mainland Tasmania for five years from 18 
    May 1999. GSLM applied for an extension of this special exploration licence 
    over a reduced area on 6 May 2004. For the renewal the licence has been reduced 
    to 15 035 square kilometres, approximately 50 per cent of the original area 
    granted.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">Renewal of exploration licences can be made provided the applicant 
    demonstrates that they have the technical ability to carry out the proposed 
    work program and the funds to undertake the agreed work program. As part of 
    their renewal application, GSLM presented the Government with a letter from 
    GEM Global Yield Fund - GGYF - London, which stated that GGYF had entered 
    into an equity line of credit with GSLM to provide up to &pound;150 million 
    to finance exploration for oil and gas in the Tasmanian basin.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">The renewal was granted on the basis that the licensee intends 
    to spend $21.5 million on exploration during the renewal period to define 
    or disprove commercial quantities of oil or gas. As a condition of renewal, 
    GSLM have agreed to meet additional licence conditions that will ensure that 
    the community gets a fair return from allocation of such a large area. These 
    conditions are as follows:</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">&middot; GLSM has provided a staged expenditure budget of 
    $21.5 million over five years.<br>
    <br>
    &middot; The Government requires GLSM to meet 80 per cent of cumulative expenditure 
    commitment at the end of each year of the licence. Failure to meet this critical 
    condition will result in revocation of the licence. <br>
    <br>
    &middot; Expenditure claimed under the licence must be consistent with industry 
    charges current at the time of the claim. <br>
    <br>
    &middot; Expenses significantly higher than industry standards will not be 
    accepted. <br>
    <br>
    &middot; Copies of all receipts shall be provided for consulting fees claimed 
    as expenditure.<br>
    <br>
    &middot; MRT will be provided with copies of reports or advice from consultants 
    to substantiate such claims.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">GSLM shall provide a review of exploration activities to Mineral 
    Resources Tasmania - MRT - on 1 April and 1 October in each year and GSLM 
    shall provide a full interpretation report for the seismic work carried out 
    between January 2001 and June 2001. This report must be provided to MRT by 
    1 December 2004.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2">The Minister for Infrastructure, Energy and Resources has 
    already publicly announced a renewal of the Great South Land licence in a 
    media release on Friday 29 October. The media release also included details 
    of various licence conditions, as previously mentioned.</font></p>
