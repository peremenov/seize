      <td> <!-- begin transcript --> SUSAN DENTZER: Let's start by talking about 
        your life as a transplant surgeon, the kinds of things that you saw that 
        got you into this aspect of research.
<p> DR. ODORICO: Well, we transplant pancreas transplants and islet cell 
          transplants for patients with Type I diabetes. And although that's quite 
          successful in many cases, and patients can come off insulin, which they 
          normally need lifelong, there are many complications that are associated 
          with the transplants--surgical complications and long-term complications 
          which can be life-threatening. Patients have to take immunosuppressive 
          medications which make them more susceptible to infections and malignancies 
          or cancers are very common after transplantation, long term, unfortunately, 
          which really can foreshorten a patient's life span even though the organ 
          may function normally. So, in this, these are complications that are 
          really devastating to see, not to mention some technical complications 
          shortly after surgery.</p>
        <p> All those together add up to some problems in pancreas, and kidney, 
          and islet transplant patients that ends up being not a perfect treatment 
          for them. So there is a plus side and a downside to transplantation. 
          We certainly effectively treat many patients, but there are some patients 
          who don't do very well, so we're looking for better treatments.</p>
        <p> In addition, there's a shortage of pancreas organs or organs in general 
          from cadaver donors, and it doesn't meet the need of all the Type I 
          diabetics in this country.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: So, when did you first say to yourself, &quot;There must 
          be a better way, and that way may have something to do with stem cells&quot;?</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: In 1995, Jamie Thompson, at the University of Wisconsin 
          here, derived Rhesus or monkey embryonic stem cells. And it occurred 
          to us at that time that, because of the incredible properties of embryonic 
          stem cells being able to differentiate into many different cell types 
          of the bodies and tissues, that this might be a potential source for 
          organs for transplantation in the future.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: So you literally thought, wow, organ supply.</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: Immediately. Immediately, as did many others. There are 
          other attributes of the cells that really are important to understanding 
          developmental biology mechanisms and how tissues, and organs, and our 
          bodies form from single cells and early embryos, and there are some 
          very important roles of embryonic stem cells and finding out basic biology, 
          but also there is the application of embryonic stem cells to actually 
          treating patients.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: I don't want to trivialize this, but of course in the 
          popular imagination, this has become the way people think about it--wow, 
          organs growing in lab dishes. Did you almost think that in '95, that 
          that was a possibility?</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: Almost, yes, although we have a long way to go yet to 
          get there, and it might be a little bit of a stretch of the imagination 
          to go from single cells to a complex organ. So many applications of 
          embryonic stem cells for treatment of patients is thought of now as 
          a cell-based therapy. You make the embryonic stem cells grow into groups 
          of cells that have a certain function, and then you transplant those 
          cells with an injection of cells to make new functions in the patient 
          to relax functions of those particular cells.</p>
        <p> And there are many diseases in humans that are characterized by the 
          loss of function of one or a few different types of cells, and those 
          diseases could be treated by some stem cell-based therapy.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: So, in '95, how quickly did you think this would become 
          a reality, that you'd actually have therapies available for patients 
          based on stem cells?</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: Well, many people, including myself perhaps, thought 
          it might be just around the corner, might be a few years, but it even 
          took 3 years for Dr. Thompson to derive human embryonic stem cells. 
          And then a few years after that, certainly many people became excited 
          that treatments were just around the corner.</p>
        <p> But I realize that, although we have to give hope to patients, I realized 
          that it was going to be a long period of time. Medical therapies don't 
          happen overnight. They evolve a lot of basic science research needed 
          to be done and still needs to be done, but there are promising aspects 
          of the research already, and significant progress has been made, such 
          that I think it's very important to keep going.<br>
          <br>
          SUSAN DENTZER: Okay. You started working first on mouse embryonic stem 
          cells. Let's walk through what you did. I'm now speaking, of course, 
          about the work that was published in Diabetes. What did you do? What 
          did you get the mouse stem cells to do?</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: Well, we really merely observed what they can do. They 
          undergo spontaneous differentiation and culture--mouse ES cells do--and 
          we wanted to look for a particular type of cell that is important for 
          patients with diabetes, and that is Islets of Langerhans, which are 
          clusters of hundreds of thousands of cells that produce different hormones, 
          particularly insulin, which helps control blood sugars.</p>
        <p> So no one had really done that much before we began looking, although 
          other cell types had been detected to be differentiated from mouse embryonic 
          stem cells. So we were interested in looking for this particular cell 
          type. Unfortunately, the cells of this type are fairly bland in appearance, 
          and they don't just jump at you, so we had to do some gene expression 
          studies or look for gene expression, look for genes turned on, a particular 
          type and look for hormones produced and detected by staining of antibodies.</p>
        <p> So--and we saw those in the cultures, in the petri dishes, as the 
          cells go through a variety of stages of embryonic development, and they 
          go through stages of early pancreas to middle pancreas, to late pancreas 
          and actually insulin-producing cells under the certain conditions.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: And so, in effect, you watched as these embryonic stem 
          cells became beta cells, correct?</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: Correct.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: And you didn't do anything magic. You just watched what 
          normally happens in an embryo, in effect.</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: Yes. </p>
        <p>SUSAN DENTZER: Was there anything magic about the culture that you whipped 
          up for this to happen in?</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: No, the culture conditions were not very specific or 
          particular. We culture them in the presence of serum and allow them 
          to form what's called embryoid bodies. And these embryoid bodies are 
          groups of cells that look like an embryo--and that's why they're called 
          embryoid bodies--but they're not quite an embryo. They are abnormal. 
          They're not normal, but they have many of the features of embryos, and 
          that's why they're called embryoid bodies.</p>
        <p> They-- going through that phase, and then subsequent, allowing subsequent 
          to occur, then you can begin to see some of the cell types: pancreatic 
          precursor cells, and within clusters of those pancreatic precursor cells, 
          insulin-producing cells.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: And what, in the end, is the significance of having demonstrated 
          this or having watched as nature, in effect, demonstrated this in mice?</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: Well, it's the first step really to getting towards a 
          therapy, and that is showing that embryonic stem cells can differentiate 
          or can become a particular cell type that produces insulin. That's important 
          for possibly treating diabetes in the future. There are many subsequent 
          steps. We have to show that they function and show that they function 
          in animals, in reverse diabetes in animals, and then we'd like to show 
          that, in preclinical models, these cells might have treatment potential.</p>
        <p> And then one needs to show that they are a safe treatment, that they 
          don't form tumors and that they're free of infection, risk, and then 
          one can think about some clinical trials or treating patients in an 
          experimental way.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: So you haven't cured any mice of diabetes yet.</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: No, we haven't. No. And we don't know who well these 
          cells function. For instance, if they're going through different pathways 
          of development, it may be that some of them are stuck in an early pathway 
          of immaturity and are not fully functional, yet some of them may have 
          gone through that whole pathway and become fully functional.<br>
          But, clearly, we need to learn about how better to get them because 
          only a rare few cells become of this type of pancreatic lineage.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: And some bail out before they get to that stage.</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: Some choose other fates, in that they choose to become 
          heart muscle and neurons or maybe don't make it all the way towards 
          insulin-producing islet cells. So we need to figure out optimal culture 
          conditions to steer them or direct them--all the cells, not just some 
          of them--to the type we're interested in.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: And what we understand, at the moment, about why some 
          cells differentiate one way and some the other way is basically nothing, 
          correct?</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: Very little. Very little. Only the beginnings of our 
          understanding of developmental biology, and particularly in mice and 
          other lesser species, very little in humans.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: Let's stay with the mice for a moment. The next stage, 
          as you say, would be to essentially try to take some of these cells 
          and put them back into mice that either had diabetes or induced to have 
          diabetes and see what happens. When will you do that?</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: Well, at this point, since it's so few cells that produce 
          insulin, I think we need to generate enriched cultures first--a lot 
          of cells producing insulin. And then once we have many of those in hand, 
          test their function in a petri dish and them simultaneously or at the 
          same time put them into mice and see how they work, see if they're able 
          to cure diabetes.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: So a mouse cure could be a couple years away.</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: Yes.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: Plus.</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: Yes.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: If it works.</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: Yes.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: And if the mice don't develop tumors.<br>
          DR. ODORICO: Yes.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: And we don't know yet how to get the cells to turn off 
          and not make tumors, correct?</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: That is a big challenge. I think that would be a significant 
          challenge, but not insurmountable. When you differentiate ES cells to 
          cells that have specific functions, they lose some of the ability to 
          divide and proliferate, which is what tumors do--tumor cells do. So, 
          if you have those cells in hand and they don't have that ability to 
          proliferate, then they're less likely to develop tumors.</p>
        <p> There are also genetic ways of selecting or killing off the cells 
          that still have tumor potential, which are the undifferentiated ES cells 
          to start with. Once they become differentiated, they have less tumor 
          potential, it's thought. And I think, so that tumor potential may be 
          controllable, but still, for treatment, it's obviously a very important 
          safety issue.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: Because you couldn't guarantee that you might--you couldn't 
          guarantee that you might not transplant one lousy cell into a mouse 
          that would create a tumor.</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: Well, there would be--have to be some strict safety standards, 
          I think.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: Which means that when it comes to applying this to humans, 
          what?</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: It means doing some pilot studies in larger animals like 
          Rhesus monkeys perhaps or human models that are applicable and then 
          showing safety in that setting before ever treating a human.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: So, again, not to dwell on this, but just so that we 
          can make it clear to the public how far away these therapeutic applications 
          could be, even if everything goes fabulously well, [it could be] 10 
          years maybe, maybe more, before you're actually in human trials.</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: I think that's realistic. If you had to put a number 
          on it, although, in this business, it's hard to put a number on it.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: And if we did, say, a numerical scale, where 100 is a 
          therapy for humans, and that's the state of the science that we have 
          to get to before we're actually routinely providing this therapy to 
          humans, where are we on that scale of zero to 100 at this point?</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: I would say we're at the very earliest stage, maybe 10.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: Now, Ron Reagan said last night in his convention speech, 
          imagine if you could have a &quot;biological repair kit&quot; on deposit 
          at your local hospital of your own stem cells. Does the public have 
          unrealistic expectations at this point about how quickly all of this 
          will pan out?</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: Well, for some diseases it may be closer at hand. For 
          other diseases, we're still at the earliest stages. For Alzheimer's 
          disease, it may be challenging because we don't know a lot about what 
          causes Alzheimer's in the first place. For other diseases, like Parkinson's 
          disease or cardiac failure, there are relevant cell populations that 
          have already been derived from human ES cells and that function well.</p>
        <p> And early animal models are going on now. Early animal studies are 
          going on now such that I think the applications in those settings may 
          be sooner based on robustly functioning cells being derived from human 
          ES cells.</p>
        <p> Whereas, islet transplantation instead from ES cell-based therapy 
          is probably a little bit farther away because we haven't demonstrated, 
          no one has demonstrated, functional cells from human ES cells that are 
          able to cure an animal at this stage.</p>
        <p> On the other hand, cell-based therapies in general have been shown 
          to be successful in patients with Type I diabetes, and what I'm talking 
          about there is human cadaver donor, pancreases recovered and then islets 
          isolated from them and then transplanted to Type I diabetics. And that 
          cell therapy we know works.</p>
        <p> Whereas, in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and heart failure, 
          other potential applications from ES cells, we don't know whether cell-based 
          therapies will have a beneficial effect. So, in that sense, there is 
          a precedent for cell-based therapies that can be ES cells and ES cell-derived 
          islet tissue can be immediately applied to humans if it shows to be 
          functional.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: So that strengthens the case for this therapy actually 
          being applicable here.</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: Yes.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: What work are you doing now on human embryonic stem cells 
          in this lab?</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: Well, we're working on a variety of fronts. One major 
          one is to find optimal culture conditions which allow directed differentiation 
          of human ES cells to islet tissue.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: And by &quot;directed&quot; you mean you want to aim 
          for one particular type of cell.</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: Right.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: You're asking what culture conditions do you need to 
          get the cell type you want.</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: Exactly. And that set of conditions is elusive right 
          now, and many other investigators around the country are working on 
          that, and that's a major effort right now, and I think the first next 
          step.</p>
        <p> Other things we're working on are using genetic selection methods 
          to select out the cell types of interest from a heterogenous mix of 
          cells or enriching cultures by sorting cells.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: Here at Wisconsin you're working on authorized lines, 
          in effect, the five cell lines that have been derived here. So you don't 
          have a problem. You've got a good, steady in-house supply of stem cell 
          lines. So has the president's policy, as announced in August 2001, has 
          any of that precluded any research you might have wanted to undertake 
          or have you essentially been immune to this? Have you felt any impact 
          of this policy in a negative way?</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: We have, yes, because there are some experiments we'd 
          like to do which we are more cautious about and have not undertaken 
          yet, and that is some experiments which would--might be conditions which 
          might drive the cells to a particular type of cell and the cell type 
          we're interested in.</p>
        <p> And those are basic developmental biology studies which allow co-culture 
          or commingling of embryonic tissues that might have inducing or directed 
          differentiation properties, and commingling those tissues from embryos 
          with the embryonic stem cells or putting the embryonic stem cells in 
          an embryo of another species and seeing what they can become in that 
          setting.</p>
        <p> We haven't undertaken those experiments because of the questions of 
          introducing human ES cells into other species' embryos.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: So just to make up an example, you might want to take 
          a human embryonic cell and essentially put it into a mouse embryo.</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: Yes.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: And you're not sure if you can do that.</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: Right.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: Because?</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: Because of the federal regulations of restrictions on 
          what types of experiments are done with human ES cells. They're in the 
          restrictions that you cannot introduce human ES cells into the embryo 
          of a human or another species.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: So that's--</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: Off limits.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: Verboten.</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: Yeah.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: So that's another aspect of the president's policy that 
          you would want to see changed.</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: Yes.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: Have you asked that that be done?</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: No.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: Why?</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: There are many other experiments to work on at this point, 
          and you know we have to live within the restrictions, current restrictions. 
          But I think it would be a benefit to understanding basic developmental 
          biology mechanisms and understanding how to direct differentiation to 
          certain cell types if those experiments could be carried out.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: And why would it be necessary to introduce that into 
          another species to do that?</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: I think, ethically, I have difficulty introducing human 
          ES cells into human embryos, as many people might, but other embryos 
          of other species might have inductive properties that reproduce that 
          of all embryos, and if put in the right tissue in the right location, 
          the ES cells of humans might communicate with the chemicals and processes 
          that are going on in the other species' embryos. We might want to do 
          this because it would be easier to introduce them into embryos of other 
          species rather than human embryos.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: Ethically easier.</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: For ethical reasons.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: Let's assume for the moment the president's policy stays 
          in place for an unknown period of time, but some time into the future--five, 
          maybe even ten years--how much will that hurt progress in this, in the 
          field or will it make any difference? Can you progress with the existing 
          cell lines?</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: I think it will hurt progress because some of the existing 
          cell lines that were derived in 1998 are getting worn out. And what 
          I mean by that is they're developing chromosomal abnormalities or genetic 
          changes, mutations that will affect their ability, might affect their 
          ability to differentiate in cell types one is interested in.</p>
        <p> It may also make them have a greater tumor potential or greater propensity 
          to form tumors. So I think the cells that have been intermittently in 
          culture in a petri dish now for six years are starting to get worn out, 
          and we need fresh cells, I think.<br>
          SUSAN DENTZER: And your colleague, Jamie Thomson, says that this happens 
          with all types of cells. He says that it is an issue that is overdone, 
          even in the scientific community, that these things happen, and you 
          can also regenerate cell lines.<br>
          DR. ODORICO: Yes. All cells in our body age and senesce, embryonic stem 
          cells are particularly special in that category because they have a 
          much slower aging process and don't senesce like normal cells in adult--our 
          adult bodies.<br>
          The--however, genetic changes can still occur, and there is selective 
          pressure of the cells when they're in the petri dish which can allow 
          abnormal cells to have a growth advantage and outgrow the normal cells. 
          And starting out with one cell over time, you get all the cells becoming 
          abnormal.<br>
          So, even if the cells don't age as other adult cells, somatic cells 
          do, you can still get abnormal changes, and they have been documented 
          already, and I think that poses a long-term problem, and I think ultimately 
          some of the cells are going to be worn out to such a degree that they 
          become unusable.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: And you can't just go back to the freezer and get the 
          original stock out and thaw them out and start growing a new generation?</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: Well, you can go back in some cases to what's called 
          an earlier passage, younger cells, and thaw them. However, once those 
          get used up, too--there's only a finite number of those--and once those 
          all get used up, we're talking about using cells with later and later 
          passage, which have been in culture in a petri dish for longer and longer 
          periods of time, and ultimately there have to be changes that occur, 
          there's no doubt in my mind, because culture conditions are abnormal 
          conditions, and some genetic changes might even--would even occur in 
          the embryo or in the body.</p>
        <p> So, over time, genetic changes can occur and mutations can occur, 
          and ultimately I think that's going to be a problem. So we need new 
          fresh lines to replenish the older, worn-out ones.<br>
          <br>
          SUSAN DENTZER: Let's talk about why you think it may be necessary to create 
          insulin-producing pancreatic cells from human embryonic stem cells.</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: In the U.S. about 1,500 pancreas transplants are done 
          every year and, on an average, about 100, if that many, islet cell transplants--50 
          to 100 islet cell transplants--but that's growing exponentially.</p>
        <p> Pancreas transplantation has a little flatter curve of rise of numbers, 
          but you're talking about 30,000 new Type I diabetics or more every year 
          in the U.S, a million Type I diabetics existing, and the numbers of 
          organ donors in the United States, human cadaver organ donors is about 
          6,000 or so, 8,000. It doesn't even come close to meeting the need.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: How many Type I patients would normally progress to the 
          state that they would need a transplant?</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: It depends on how severe they get, but you could argue 
          that ultimately all of them would benefit from a transplant because 
          what happens is that there are acute life-threatening events that can 
          occur from low blood sugars or high blood sugars that can cause seizures, 
          car accidents, coma, that cause mortality acutely or rapidly, and those 
          can occur in anybody, particularly though in the more brittle Type I 
          diabetics.</p>
        <p> And then many patients, but not all, get chronic problems, long-term 
          problems of many years of high blood sugars. It affects other organs 
          like the eyes, heart, blood circulation, nerves, and particularly the 
          kidneys. So patients have many, many complications, and it's very costly 
          for medical care. Fourteen percent of GNP in some countries is spent 
          on medical care for diabetes, and particularly in Western countries, 
          and it's a devastating, very debilitating disease.<br>
          And it's not clear which patients at this point--it's hard to predict, 
          I should say, which patients, of all the Type I diabetics, what patients 
          will go on to some of these problems, but many of them do.</p>
        <p> SUSAN DENTZER: Why, ethically, do you think it's all right to do this 
          research on human embryonic stem cells when, clearly, some percent of 
          the population thinks it's anathema? Why do you think it's not anathema?</p>
        <p> DR. ODORICO: Well, I think the principle or the reason they say that 
          embryonic stem cell research should not be done is because the embryo 
          is an individual or a person, and that would be tantamount to killing 
          an individual person.<br>
          However, an embryo, and particularly ES cells in culture, are not people. 
          They may have the potential to become an individual under the right 
          conditions, but it's that separation, that separating potential from 
          what is, is what I think separates something that should be protected, 
          as a human subject is in research, versus something that doesn't deserve 
          the same level of protection from the point of view of research.</p>
        <p> I like to use the analogy of the acorn and the oak tree. We all believe 
          that we should conserve oak trees and trees in general because of their 
          beauty, and their stature, and the good things they provide nature and 
          us. An oak tree comes from an acorn. There are lots of acorns running 
          around that have the potential to become an oak tree, yet we don't go 
          around conserving acorns. And I think that's why I think that if ES 
          cells represent the acorn in that analogy, then I don't think we need 
          to go around conserving ES cells or embryos that can become ES cells.<br>
