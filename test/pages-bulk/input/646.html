<span style="font-size: 10pt; color: navy; font-family: Arial">Each one of us 
has our own personal reasons to Relay, whether it be a family member, friend or 
even ourselves who has been diagnosed with Cancer. But we all Relay toward the 
same outcome. Hope drives us all, and we derive our inspiration from the stories 
and faith of others. &quot;Because of YOU... lives are saved, lives are changed.&quot; The 
reason why I Relay is to preserve the memory of my Uncle Wallace Campbell, to 
honor my mother, Myrtle Pake, for her battle and survival of breast cancer and 
my father, Dennis Pake, who has had melanoma. I also Relay for you so that 
hopefully you will not ever hear those terrible words “You have cancer”. I Relay 
to raise funds for research, advocacy and patient support programs. I love 
fighting for a cure for cancer, bringing hope. </span></font></font></p>

and maintain the highest possible quality of life. I am extremely passionate 
about Relay and seeing this fight to the end. I joined the staff of the American 
Cancer Society in December 2004 and will happily lose the job of my dreams 
because of the ultimate goal: finding a cure for cancer. With God as our main 
supporter and each one of us, one day soon the dreaded “C” word “Cancer” will be 
just another word in our history books. <br>

why I am so passionate about the Relay for Life.&nbsp; People wonder, is it 
because I’ve had cancer myself or that I’ve lost a loved one to the awful 
disease?&nbsp; I Relay because I know it could be me someday.&nbsp; We are all 
surrounded by cancer every day.&nbsp; We can’t get away from it.&nbsp; I lost a 
cousin this past week to lung cancer.&nbsp; He was 45 years old and a single 
dad.&nbsp; The wife of one of my co-workers was diagnosed a month ago with colon 
cancer.&nbsp; She is 35 years old and has two small children.&nbsp; These aren’t

<p><font face="Arial">On August 11, 1997, I experienced the worst day of my life 
(or so I thought). My 7 year old son Christopher was diagnosed with 
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. I always thought this was something that happened to 
other people. I couldn't believe this was happening to &quot;MY&quot; child. I found out 
then, and many times since, that it can happen to anyone. As it turns out, May 
10, 2001 was the worst day of my life. After a 4 year courageous battle, my 
&quot;baby&quot; lost his battle with that dreaded disease.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">With Christopher as my inspiration, I &quot;Relay&quot; so that some 
day, other children and their parents do not have to experience the horrible 
disease of cancer and what it does to you physically and emotionally. I don't 
want any child to have to go through what my son went through and I don't want 
any parent to have to experience the loss of a child.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">For me, participating in the Relay for Life helps to make 
something positive out of something so very negative. I am confident some day 
there will be a cure for cancer, and I will have the satisfaction of knowing 
that I played a very small part in it.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">I spent my 26th birthday (October) in Asheville 
with my dad and his new wife.&nbsp; It was then that my dad decided to tell me 
something that would forever change my life.&nbsp; He had always complained of 
gall stones, so decided it was time to have them removed.&nbsp; He'd had his 
surgery the week before.&nbsp; Come to find out it wasn't gall stones he had 
been complaining of for the last 15 years, it was intestinal cancer.&nbsp; The 
doctors did an open/close procedure for a biopsy to determine what all was 
involved.&nbsp; EVERYTHING...the cancer was touching almost every part of him.&nbsp; 
For the next 6 weeks, I would travel from Raleigh to Asheville every Friday 
through Sunday and spend every precious moment with my father.&nbsp; We came to 
understand each other and express our love, support, faith and being so proud of 
each other.&nbsp; With God beside him during the night, my father passed away 
December 4, 1993.&nbsp; Only 6 weeks after they diagnosed him with cancer.&nbsp; 
We had just celebrated his 56th birthday the night before, with each of his 
three children there. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Arial">My dad wasn't alive for some of the most important parts of my 
life..he never met my husband, nor was he there for my wedding or the birth of 
my daughter.&nbsp; I do believe that he WAS with me through it all.&nbsp; I feel that I am 
giving something back to my father by doing the Relay.&nbsp; It makes me feel worth 
while and I know that he would be so proud. </font></p>

December 25, 1999, this man died.&nbsp; This man was my dearest and best friend’s 
husband. &nbsp;In early 2000, a man was told he had a mass in his lungs.&nbsp; A mass, not

work on things and figure them out.&nbsp; He loved keys and loved to open things up 
and see what was inside. He loved his #1 baby.&nbsp; A soft, stuffed little green and 
white rabbit.&nbsp; He loved his family and his baby sister.&nbsp; That baby boy turned 
into a little man and on August 11, 1997, which happened to be his grandmother’s 
birthday, he &nbsp;was treated for strep throat and enlarged lymph nodes.&nbsp; Strep 
throat, not cancer!&nbsp; He was seven and a half years old. &nbsp;And on May 10, 2001, 
this little boy died from this dreaded disease called cancer!!&nbsp; This brave 
and courageous little boy was my great-nephew. This should not have 
happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;This should not happen to any child or adult. </font></p>

diagnosed with cancer during this time period, some are survivors and others 
have lost their battle with cancer. &nbsp;It is time to come together and do whatever 
it takes to find a cure for this thing called CANCER!! &nbsp;Why do I relay?&nbsp; I hope 
that my small part will help to save the lives of the rest of my family and the 
many, many friends that I have.&nbsp; GOD BLESS EVERYONE WHO RELAYS!!!</font></p>

by cancer in some way….whether it’s battling this horrible disease personally or 
watching a loved one suffer.&nbsp;&nbsp; In October 1980, after numerous tests, x-rays, 
and finally exploratory surgery, my mother’s doctors discovered that she had 
pancreatic cancer.&nbsp; From the very beginning they gave us no hope and did not 
even recommend treatment.&nbsp; My family had never had anything to “rock our world” 
as this did, and being in total denial we refused to accept her fate. &nbsp;An 
oncologist finally agreed to try chemotherapy but after only two treatments, 
mother was too weak to go through anymore.&nbsp; After suffering for six months, she 
passed away April 17, 1981. To this day I haven’t forgotten what she went 
through and the feeling of total helplessness my family felt because there 
wasn’t a “cure” to save our mother.&nbsp; Since that time, we’ve lost a dear aunt and 
uncle to cancer and, although it was not the cause of his death, my dad had 
prostate cancer when he passed away in May 2001.&nbsp; These are ALL Reasons for me 
to Relay, and whatever small part I play in raising money for cancer research is 
a labor of love in memory of these very special people.</font></p>

<img border="0" src="photogallery/AmieF.gif" width="217" height="235" align="left">In 
the spring of 1988, one of my best friends (the pretty blonde in our attached 
homecoming dance picture) was diagnosed with cancer. For 3 years, she battled 
this disease, but ultimately lost her battle during our senior year in high 
school. During that time, I wasn't the friend I could have been...I didn't 
really know quite what to do or what to say to show her how much I cared. I wish 
we had Relay in my hometown back then - I know we could have done so much to 
fight cancer, as well as show our support for our friend. I love seeing families 
and friends at the Relay, often with the survivors they are supporting - your 
hard work means so much to them, and to all of us who want to find a cure. Thank 
you!</p>

<font face="Verdana" size="2">CANCER---this six letter word brings such fear and 
heartache to so many. &nbsp;My first response as to &quot;Why I Relay&quot; is to say to find a 
cure! &nbsp;Secondly, I'm reminded of the moments in my life that have been touched 
by cancer (my mother-in-law surviving breast cancer, my own scare with a 
suspicious lump, and the death of two mothers this year in my son's 6th grade 
class). &nbsp;</font> <br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">When I was asked last year to walk in the 
Pittsboro Relay for Life my first thought raced to the death of a dear friend's 
son. &nbsp; I don't even live in Pittsboro and my immediate response was YES, sign me 
up. &nbsp;The ache in my heart I feel each time I see my friend eases somewhat when I 
see all of the Relay teams working so hard to raise money for the American 
Cancer Society. &nbsp;Working together we are all making a difference----no matter 
how big or how small the contribution. &nbsp;</font> <br>
<br>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">If you ever question why you do this or you become 
tired of asking for donations or selling this and that...stop for a minute and 
think of what others have lost and remind yourself that it could have been your 
mother, your child, or your best friend who lost their battle. &nbsp; All of the work 
we do is for those who did not survive and for those who will!</font></p>

<font face="Arial" size="2">If you know me...you know I'm a talker. &nbsp;My 
Grandmother, Alma Brown, was a talker too - except she got the point across in a 
lot less time than it takes me! &nbsp;She was my best friend and soul mate. &nbsp;She had 
seven kids, 12 grand-kids, and 11 great-grand-children! &nbsp;Even though I was only 
one of her 12 grand-kids...she had a unique way of making me feel I was her very 
favorite. In fact, I even signed all my cards to her &quot;From your favorite 
Grand-daughter Kay.&quot; &nbsp;You know it takes someone very special to make each one of 
us feel so special.</font> <br>
<br>
<font face="Arial" size="2">In January 2000 my Grandmother was diagnosed with 
renal cancer. &nbsp;She died one month to the day of her diagnosis, February 14, 2000 
- Valentine's Day. &nbsp;She accepted what God had given her, but I had a much harder 
time letting go. &nbsp;I made a choice to try and do something to honor her 
memory...I just couldn't let her slip away! &nbsp;Cancer may have struck my 
Grandmother physically, but it actually attacked our entire family - leaving a 
hole where she used to be. &nbsp;But the Lord is always good and works in mysterious 
ways and I responded to a request for volunteers for Pittsboro's first annual 
Relay for Life which was a HUGE success!</font> <br>
<br>
<font face="Arial" size="2">Now I'd be lying to myself if I ended the story 
there...my primary reason was to honor my own Grandmother, but there is so much 
more now. &nbsp;Since being involved with the Relay, I have realized the number of 
friends, family, co-workers, etc., that have had their lives touched and 
destroyed in some way by cancer...and I too have had my own scares more than 
once. &nbsp;I only needed to see the bald head on ONE child to pull at my heart 
strings, I only needed to hear the cry of ONE parent in sorrow so deep that 
no-one - not anyone - could comfort, I only once needed to see the tears of my 
parents at the news of a loss of a friend (and there have been several) due to 
cancer. &nbsp;And I have only ONCE had to feel the helplessness of not being able to 
help someone I care about. &nbsp;I Relay because I do believe there is a cure and 
that we are so close to finding it...and I am helping in some small way to find 
it! &nbsp;I Relay because I refuse to let this disease to take control and just sit 
back and watch! &nbsp;I Relay because I can....how could you not?</font></p>

  <font face="Arial" size="2">Why do I Relay? I have asked myself this several 
  times. I guess that’s why it has taken me to this, my third year involved in 
  the Relay to put it into words. I am lucky. My family has little to no cancer. 
  I have never lost a close relative to this horrible disease. So when I think 
  about why I Relay I think because I was meant to. It is my responsibility to 
  support my community, friends and family by giving back all that I can. I 
  believe that all things happen for a reason and God has allowed me to be 
  involved with the Relay for Life in order to show me cancer, its affects and 
  allow these to touch my life. So when I think about why I Relay it’s to serve 
  my friends and community, to continue the fight against this tragic disease 
  and to touch others lives as I my self have been touched. I can only hope that 
  my efforts compel another person to join this fight.</font></p>

<p>In 2003, I relayed with The Survivors just to do something to help. This 
year, I wanted to make a bigger difference, so I decided to form a team of my 
own. Then in November, I was given an even bigger reason. My mom was diagnosed 
with breast cancer. I felt like the rug had been pulled out from under me. But, 
I knew we had work to do and I had to be brave and have a deeper faith than ever 
before. I thank the Lord everyday because the cancer was removed and now she is 
going through radiation treatments. My mom is a survivor! </p>
<p>I am co-captain of Bells Angels, from Bells Baptist church. Our church has

steal a quote from the late Jim Valvano, &quot;Don't give up; don't ever, ever give 
up.&quot; </p>

<p><font size="2">I became involved in Relay because the profound effect that 
Cancer had on my family. <br>
<br>
I had always thought of my Gramps as Superman. He was never sick, always had 
energy, loved to Fish, play with his grandchildren, travel and teach us life's 
lessons. When he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, I was crushed. If cancer 
could strike this man who I thought was indestructible, who next. Unfortunately, 
he lost his fight with cancer more than ten years ago. We all miss him dearly. I 
Relay in his memory!<br>
<br>
My Brother, George, was also struck with cancer several years ago. I had a hard 
time dealing with his illness. I stayed away because I just didn't know what to 
say or do or even how to act. I will never be able to forgive myself for that 
because he needed his family during that time. He recovered and is in full 
remission. I Relay in his Honor! <br>
<br>
Won't you join me in the Fight!</font></p>

<p>My involvement in Relay For Life was initiated by a &quot;cold call&quot; from Carol 
Esau in 2003 to form a team from our church. I had not been involved in the 
first Relay For Life event, but had heard wonderful things about it. I took the 
challenge, and it turned out to be one of the most meaningful things I have done 
in my life. When cancer strikes someone you love there is not much you can do 
but pray, and be supportive. I lost my grandfather to colon cancer, my 
grandmother was a breast cancer survivor, my father is a melanoma survivor, two 
cousins died of melanoma at ages 41 and 51, and I have another cousin in her 
fight with breast cancer, and it does not stop there. My best friend from 
college days has a 7 year old daughter who was diagnosed at age 4 with liver 
cancer. She is in her third year after her transplant and doing great!</p>
<p>At our church alone we have lost several wonderful church members to cancer. 
We do have cancer survivors in our church and I Relay for them with the hope 
that they will be with us for a long, long time. It makes me feel good to know 
that the money we raise at Relay filters into the lives of survivors at some 
point in time. My hope is that through this fundraising future generations will 
have alternatives for treatment and a higher success rate for a cure. Everyone 
is affected by cancer at some time in their life.&nbsp; Our stories are about 
different people with the same disease, cancer.&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you get a call to participate in Relay ...&quot;just do it&quot;, everything else 
will speak for itself.</p>

<p><font size="2">I'm not a participant from Pittsboro, I &quot;Relay&quot; in Cheshire, 
CT, but I saw your site and wanted to let you know why I Relay. I hope you don't 
mind me taking up some of your space. I Relay for my grandmother&nbsp;that I never 
knew because she died from cancer before I was even born, I've been told that I 
get my red hair and my love of reading from her, but I'll never know. I Relay 
for Nick, one of the first friends I can remember, he had leukemia. I remember 
him not having any hair and always wearing a fireman's hat, he never got to grow 
up, he died at the age of 11.&nbsp;I Relay for my&nbsp;aunt who is a breast cancer 
survivor, she is my proof that this disease can be beaten. I Relay for my uncle, 
who I named my team after, The Corriveau Crusaders, he survived stomach cancer, 
only to succumb to pancreatic cancer a year later. There have been others in my 
life who fought their battles with cancer, a friend's uncle, a teacher, a 
neighbor, some have won, others have lost. The wound that is still the freshest 
and the most painful is the one caused by the loss of &quot;Pa&quot;. Pa was my surrogate 
grandfather, since I never had one of my own, he was my friend's grandfather and 
I lived next to him my entire life. He was an amazing man to everyone who knew 
him. He had lung cancer and had had portions of lung removed years earlier, it 
finally caught up to him and he died last March 2004. I Relay so I can do my 
part to eradicate this awful disease. </font></p>
