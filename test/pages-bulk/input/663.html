            isn't dead and Anakin doesn't turn.<br>
            <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> All rights reserved to George Lucas, who'd probably be very
            upset if he saw this - good thing he won't.</font></small><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><hr>
            <p><strong><small><font face="Arial">Part V</font></small></strong></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Anakin sat cross-legged on the floor of the Queen's sitting
            room, eyes half closed in meditation. Only a few standing lights were still burning and
            the door to the bedroom was securely shut. Suddenly his eyes popped open and he got to his
            feet. A moment later the lift door opened for Qui-Gon, still accompanied by Obi-Wan and
            Jacen. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Captain Typho has more than enough men
            downstairs.&quot; Obi-Wan was saying. &quot;No assassin will try that way.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">The Master nodded, face closed eyes distant. His past and
            present Padawans looked at him and then at each other, they knew that look. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Master?&quot; Anakin prodded. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Qui-Gon blinked, focused on him, smiled. &quot;Anything to
            report?&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Quiet as a tomb. The girls went to bed an hour or so
            ago.&quot; Anakin glanced uneasily around the luxurious room. &quot;I don't like just
            waiting here for something to happen to her.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Don't anticipate, Anakin, focus on the moment.&quot;
            the Master sat down on one of the couches. &quot;We must be patient.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;I'm sorry, Master,&quot; Anakin shrugged at little.
            &quot;I'm not much good at patience.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">An amused glance from the Master. &quot;I know.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Obi-Wan picked up the small security monitor lying on a
            table, frowned at the blank screen.&quot; &quot;What's this?&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;She wouldn't let me put any cameras in her room.&quot;
            Anakin explained, adding apologetically. &quot;I don't think she liked the idea of me
            watching her.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;What is she thinking?&quot; Obi-Wan looked towards the
            bedroom door as if tempted to shake the Queen awake and demand an explanation. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Artoo is in there with her,&quot; Anakin assured
            Qui-Gon, &quot;set on surveillance mode. He'll pick up an intruder as quickly as the
            cameras would.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;I'm not worried about intruders.&quot; Obi-Wan snapped.
            &quot;Professional assassins have ways of killing from a distance that not even Artoo
            could detect.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;I know but we want to catch this assassin, don't we,
            Master?&quot; Anakin countered, still addressing Qui-Gon. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;You're using her as bait.&quot; Obi-Wan sounded
            incredulous as well as angry. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;It was her idea.&quot; Anakin retorted defensively.
            Turned back to Qui-Gon. &quot;Don't worry, no harm will come to her. I'm aware of
            everything going on in that room.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;It's too risky.&quot; said Obi-Wan, also to Qui-Gon,
            then to Anakin. &quot;Besides, your senses aren't that attuned, young Padawan.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;And yours are?&quot; Anakin challenged, temper fraying.
            </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Obi-Wan's look was sternly quelling. &quot;Possibly.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Obi-Wan is older and more experienced.&quot; the Master
            cut in quietly. &quot;And you are letting emotion cloud your mind, Anakin. Let go of fear
            and feel the Living Force.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">His Padawn bit his lip. &quot;I'll try, Master.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Do or do not, there is no try.&quot; Jacen quoted in a
            rather good imitation of Yoda's voice. Both Anakin and Obi-Wan grinned and the tension
            between them eased. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Stay with us, Obi-Wan.&quot; Qui-Gon continued.
            &quot;It may be we'll solve your problem as well as our own tonight.&quot;
            ****************************************** </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Hours passed. The Master occupied one couch, radiating peace
            as he meditated, Jacen the other, openly dozing. Obi-Wan and Anakin stood near the bedroom
            door talking in undertones. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Master risked his own future with the Order to see you
            trained,&quot; Obi-Wan was saying with quiet intensity, &quot;will you throw that gift
            back in his face?&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Of course not!&quot; Anakin hissed back. &quot;I'd
            never do that to him.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Then *think* about what you are doing, Anakin!&quot;
            the young Master retorted. &quot;If you continue to follow your impulses you could hurt a
            lot of people,&quot; nodded towards the bedroom, &quot;including her!&quot; his voice
            softened. &quot;Not to mention yourself.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;I've thought about her and dreamed about her every day
            for the last ten years.&quot; Anakin admitted painfully. Took a breath. &quot;You're
            right, Padme's an attachment, like my Mother, and like Mom I've got to let her go.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Obi-Wan put a consoling hand on his shoulder. Suddenly both
            their heads swivled towards the door. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Obi-Wan!&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;I feel it also.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Sabres drawn they sprinted into the Queen's Bedroom </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Amidala woke with a shock. She had a split second glimpse of
            segmented, multi-legged *somethings* before they vanished in a flash of green light. Saw
            Anakin standing over her on the bed, sabre blazing in his hand, and Obi-Wan go through the
            window with a crash of glass and clash of blinds. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Idiot!&quot; Anakin doused his sabre and ran out past
            Master Qui-Gon. The other Padawan started to follow but the Master called him back.
            &quot;No, Jacen, I need you here.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Eirtae and Rabe hurtled into the room, flinging themselves
            down beside her. &quot;Your Highness, are you all right?&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Amidala managed a nod, her voice wasn't working yet. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Typho was right behind them with a pair of guards. &quot;What
            happened?&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;The Queen is safe.&quot; Qui-Gon told him but she
            musn't stay here.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;She can come down to my rooms.&quot; Jamillia spoke
            breathlessly from the doorway, a robe clutched around her and a handmaiden at her back. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;An excellent idea, Senator. Your Highness?&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Yes, yes of course.&quot; Amidala said shakily. She got
            out of bed, Rabe quickly draped a dressing gown over her. She started for the door,
            Eirtae's arm around her. Paused to look at the broken window and then at the Master.
            &quot;Obi-Wan, Anakin...?&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;They'll be all right.&quot; he reassured her. Eyebrows
            quirked ruefully. &quot;I'm afraid both my past and present Padawans are somewhat
            reckless.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Amidala scraped up a smile. &quot;I wonder where they could
            have learned it from?&quot; and his eyes crinkled in answering amusement. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Come on, Ammi,&quot; Jamillia said taking her arm,
            &quot;it'll be just like at school. Remember how we used to sneak into each others rooms
            after hours?&quot; they headed for the lift, the other four women clustered tightly around
            her, and nearly collided with Jar Jar followed by a pair of armed Gungans. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Padme! Yousa not hurtin?&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;I'm fine, General Binks, don't worry.&quot; then they
            were in the lift, the doors closing behind them, as Jar Jar demanded; &quot;Captain Typho,
            whatsa goin' on herin?&quot;</font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></small></p>
            <p><strong><small><font face="Arial">Part VI</font></small></strong></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Anakin wove frantically through the nightime traffic high
            above the rooftops of Coruscant. Flashes of blaster fire some distance away caught his
            eye. &quot;That's gotta be him.&quot; he decked the accelerator but by the time he got to
            the scene there was no blaster fire, no assassin droid, just a spread-eagled human body
            falling towards the brightly lighted canyons thousands of feet below. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Anakin dove steeply, pulled up and Obi-Wan landed on the
            speeder's stern as neatly as one could please. He clambered breathlessly into the
            passenger seat. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Master Kenobi, fancy meeting you here.&quot; Anakin
            greeted mockingly </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;What took you so long?&quot; the other snapped. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;You know me, Obi-Wan, I had to find a speeder I really
            liked; mach 10 engines, open cockpit, totally cool paint job -&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;I am underwelmed by your wit, Padawan.&quot; the
            Master's voice dripped icicles, &quot;Where's Jacen?&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Back with our Master I guess, he didn't catch up with
            me in time.&quot; As they spoke Anakin spotted a sleek closed speeder leaving with
            suspicious speed and gave chase. &quot;That him?&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Obi-Wan's face went blank a moment as he searched the Force.
            &quot;Yes!&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Riiight!&quot; Anakin hit the accelerator again. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Sensing he was being followed the assassin wove confusingly
            through traffic lanes, between buildings and through the interlaced beams of a
            half-finished skyscraper. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Obi-Wan clung white knuckled to the side of the speeder.
            &quot;Careful! Hey, easy!&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Sorry, Master, I forgot you don't like flying.&quot;
            The speeder dropped a few feet, just enough to miss an oncoming transport. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;I don't like flying with *you*!&quot; Obi-Wan retorted.
            </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Anakin looked over at him. &quot;Obi-Wan, you know I've been
            flying since before I could walk I'm very good -&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Watch where you're going!&quot; an oncoming stream of
            private speeders split to avoid them. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Anakin dropped out of the lane. &quot;Sorry about that.&quot;
            </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Obi-Wan closed his eyes, inhaled a calming breath. &quot;Just
            slow down.&quot; he said in carefully measured tones. Opened his eyes, pointed.
            &quot;There! There he goes.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">The assassin's speeder ducked behind a line of freight
            transports. Anakin went under them, gaining steadily as the two vehicled banked right
            turns around tower spires and neon billboards. Attempting to elude his pursuer the
            assassin ducked into a tram tunnel. Anakin promptly followed. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Wait! Don't go in there!&quot; Obi-Wan gasped as the
            tunnel closed around them. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Don't worry, Master, I know what I'm doing.&quot;
            Anakin assured him. They skimmed round a bend and right into their prey, accelerating
            frantically towards them with a tram filling the tunnel behind. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Anakin flipped the speeder upside down in a tight loop-over
            and raced out of the tunnel barely ahead of speeder and commuter tram. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Beyond speech Obi-Wan gave his companion a withering look. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Okay, that was a mistake.&quot; Anakin conceeded. The
            Assassin's speeder pulled along side, a blaster barrel protruded from a side window,
            Obi-Wan ducked just in time. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Oops!&quot; Anakin hit the brakes, dropping behind and
            under their attacker, safe from blaster fire. The assassin dove steeply downward, skimmed
            low over the flat roofs of a continent sized industrial complex, forcing Anakin to fall
            behind again. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Right. This isn't working.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;No kidding.&quot; Obi-Wan said acidly. Their prey
            pulled further ahead, shooting through a quasi-tunnel of giant energy couplings topping a
            power plant. &quot;Anakin! don't go through there!&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Ignoring him the younger Jedi accelerated right after the
            assassin, under and through the gigantic arcs of blue lightening leaping from coupling to
            coupling. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;How many times have I told you, stay away from power
            couplings!&quot; Obi-Wan complained as they shot free. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Anakin grinned. &quot;Yeah, but don't you just love that
            powerfield tingle?&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;No actually.&quot; Obi-Wan scanned the skies.
            &quot;There he goes!&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;This is getting old.&quot; Anakin muttered as they
            darted upward in pursuit. &quot;We gotta get ahead of him somehow.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">The assassin's speeder veered sharply, diving into a
            brilliantly lighted throughway for air traffic piercing a dense range of multi-spired
            towers. Anakin banked the other way looping around the buildings. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;What are you doing? you're going the wrong way.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Ani shook his head, eyes unfocused. &quot;No I'm not. This is
            a shortcut.&quot; blinked. &quot;I think.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;You *think*?&quot; Obi-Wan echoed, incredulously. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">They hovered above the stream of traffic emerging from the
            throughway for long seconds. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Obi-Wan, grimly. &quot;You've lost him.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Anakin, calmly. &quot;No I haven't.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Obi-Wan begining to lose his temper. &quot;He went completely
            the other way!&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Anakin, even more calmly. &quot;We'll see.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Obi-Wan breathed, regaining his composure. &quot;Anakin,
            we've lost him. We should -&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Excuse me, Master.&quot; Anakin said politely and
            vaulted over the side of the speeder - falling some five stories to land right on top of
            the assassin's speeder cruising beneath them. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Looking after him Obi-Wan shook his head, muttered. &quot;I
            hate it when he does that.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&nbsp;</font></small></p>
            <p><strong><small><font face="Arial">Part VII</font></small></strong></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Anakin clawed for a handhold on the sleek surface of the
            speeder as the wind tore at him. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">*Okay, maybe this wasn't such a brilliant idea.* </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">He worked his way painfully forward to the transparent
            canopy, looked in. For an instant it was a woman's face looking back at him with big dark
            eyes then abruptly, without warning, it shifted to something grey skinned and quite
            inhuman. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">*A Changeling!* </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">The assassin, whatever she or it was, braked suddenly and
            Anakin nearly went flying, barely catching himself on the left prong of the forked front,
            dangling by his hands. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">*Calm, remember calm.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">He managed to swing over to the right prong and then work his
            way up on top again. The assassin, back in Human form, glared at him through the canopy as
            he ignited his sabre to cut his way in. Grabbed the blaster lying on the seat next to her
            and fired up at him. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Anakin just managed to block the bolt, not easy at such close
            quarters, but the impact knocked the sabre from his hand. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">*Oh no, not again!* </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">He shoved his hand through the hole in the canopy, grabbing
            the assassin's wrist as she tried for a second shot. It went wild, striking the control
            board and the speeder began to lose altitude, bucking wildly. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Anakin hung on as the assassin fought for control but the
            impact as they hit the pavement of a pedestrian way sent him flying into a row of fuel
            drums. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Picking himself up he looked around. Not one of Coruscant's
            more salubrious districts, a varigated crowd of panhandling undersiders, criminals,
            con-artists and slumming glitterati were lit by garish neon signs as they wandered along
            an esplanade of gritty entertainment clubs. A few glanced at Anakin but quickly looked
            away, not wanting to get involved. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">He pushed through the crowd to the crashed speeder, saw the
            assassin climb out and gave chase, pushing and shoving people out of his way. His quarry
            darted through the door of one of the clubs and Anakin was about to follow when a hand
            fell on his arm stopping him in his tracks. He started to throw it off then realized it
            was Obi-Wan. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;She went in there!&quot; he panted. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Patience.&quot; Obi-Wan answered, annoyingly unruffled.
            &quot;Use the Force, Anakin, think. He went in there to hide, not run.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">And even more annoyingly right, as usual. &quot;Yes,
            Obi-Wan.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">The older Jedi offered him his sabre. &quot;I believe this is
            yours?&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Yeah, thanks.&quot; Anakin tried to take it but Obi-Wan
            refused to let go of his end. *Uh-oh, stand by for lecture.* </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;A Jedi's sabre is his most precious possession. He must
            keep it with him at all times.&quot; Obi-Wan scolded, transfixing him with those blue
            eyes. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Anakin restrained an urge to roll his own. &quot;Yes,
            Master.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;This weapon is your *life*!&quot; the Master
            emphasized. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;I know, I'm sorry.&quot; Obi-Wan did have a point after
            all. &quot;It was an accident.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Jedi don't have 'accident', Anakin. You must be more
            focused.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;I know, I know. Look could we have the rest of the
            lesson later, we've got an assassin to catch.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Shaking his head Obi-Wan let go of his end of the lightsabre
            and led the way into the club. &quot;How does our Master put up with you?&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;He practiced on the Padawan he had before me.&quot;
            Anakin returned saucily. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">His predecessor grinned wryly. &quot;He did indeed, poor
            Master, he always picks the difficult ones.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Anakin nodded agreement. Still, if he could manage to turn
            out even half as well as Obi-Wan had..... </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">It seemed to be some kind of sports bar. Giant screens lined
            the walls showing various games and contests - including pod-racing! Anakin tore his eyes
            away and reminded himself to focus. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Do you see him?&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">He scanned the crowd watching the screens, drinking, laying
            bets or just talking sports talk. &quot;No. But Obi-Wan, I think he's a she and that she's
            a changeling.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Blond eyebrows lifted. &quot;In that case be extra
            careful.&quot; Obi-Wan nodded towards the crowd. &quot;Go and find her.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Anakin blinked. &quot;Me? What about you?&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;I,&quot; Obi-Wan replied coolly, &quot;am going to get
            a drink.&quot; quirked an eyebrow at him. &quot;Possibly more than one.&quot; and with
            that he headed purposefully towards the bar leaving Anakin gaping after him. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">*What happened to his focus?* he wondered. The chase must
            have been harder on Obi-Wan's nerves than he, Anakin, had realized. *I shouldn't tease
            him.* But flying was the only thing he did better than Obi-Wan and the temptation to show
            off was nearly irresistable. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Anakin circled the room, studying the polyglot patrons giving
            especial attention to the females, both Human and Alien. And they eyed him in return with
            an appreciation and invitation he'd only recently learned to recognize. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">*I wish Padme would look at me like that.* suddenly a
            familiar hum and flash of blue light spun him towards the bar. Pushing his way against the
            backwash of patrons he broke through into the empty space that had formed around Obi-Wan
            standing, sabre ignited, over a grey suited figure clutching at her arm. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">*I shoulda known.* Anakin added aloud. &quot;I can't take you
            anywhere, can I?&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Obi-Wan just flicked him a glance, extinguished his sabre and
            reached down to pull the assassin to her feet. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Jedi business.&quot; Anakin announced to the staring
            crowd. &quot;Go back to your drinks.&quot; and the patrons turned uneasily away, self
            consciously resuming their activities as the two Jedi half carried their prisoner out a
            side door into a noisome alley. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Do you know who you were trying to kill?&quot; Obi-Wan
            asked, almost conversationally, as he examined the damaged arm. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;The senator from Naboo.&quot; the woman mumbled. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Who hired you?&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;It was just a job.&quot; she evaded. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Anakin wasn't having any of that. &quot;Who hired you?&quot;
            he repeated, added with a touch of Force behind his voice. &quot;Tell us!&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;It was a bounty hunter,&quot; she muttered unwillingly,
            &quot;called -&quot; broke off with a little gasp. Her eyes glazed, then closed, and as
            Obi-Wan lowered her to the ground she changed, becoming the wrinkled grey non-Human Anakin
            had glimpsed in the speeder. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">Instinctively the two Jedi glanced over their shoulders, just
            in time to see an armoured form rocket away from a nearby rooftop. </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">They looked at each other then Obi-Wan felt at the dead
            alien's neck, extracting a wicked looking multi-tipped dart. &quot;A toxic dart.&quot; </font></small></p>
            <p><small><font face="Arial">&quot;Well it's a clue anyway.&quot; said Anakin. </font></small></p>
