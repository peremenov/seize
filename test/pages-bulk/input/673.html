      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1"><b>Frequently 
        Asked Questions</b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Is it 
        better to live on or off campus during the freshman year?</b><br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">On campus 
        living has a number of benefits for new college students that off campus 
        living does not. Living on campus gives new freshmen the opportunity to 
        meet and live with many other college students. Obviously, such an arrangement 
        would provide you with ample opportunities to meet and make new friends 
        quickly. On campus living is also very convenient. Since you&#146;re living 
        on campus, you&#146;re close to classroom buildings and all of the other 
        facilities that house valuable university services and resources. It&#146;s 
        easier to get involved on campus and attend university functions because 
        you&#146;re &quot;close to all of the action&quot; on campus. Finally, 
        students living on campus have both student and professional staff members 
        who reside in the residence halls with them. These staff members provide 
        resources, assistance and support to students residing on campus. National 
        statistics show that students who live on campus tend to be more actively 
        involved on campus and achieve higher grades than those who opt to live 
        off campus. After a year or two on campus, you may choose to take a look 
        at off campus living, as you will have established a fairly strong social 
        network and solid study habits. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Can I 
        have guests visit me if I live on campus?</b><br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Yes! You&#146;re 
        certainly welcome to have friends, classmates, and family members visit 
        you in your residence hall on campus. The extent of this visitation varies 
        greatly from university to university. Some universities visitation policies 
        are more liberal while others are more conservative. You may attend a 
        university that allows guests in the residence halls 24 hours a day, 7 
        days a week. Other universities may have limited visitation during the 
        week such as 8:00 a.m &#150; midnight during the week and 7:00 a.m. &#150; 
        2:00 a.m. on weekends or 7:00 a.m.- 2:00 a.m. during the week and 24 hour 
        visitation during the weekends. Some universities may have more strict 
        visitation policies. Visitation policies on campus may also vary from 
        residence hall to residence hall. Be sure to find out what type of visitation 
        policy exists on the college campus you will be attending. If you choose 
        to live on campus, you will want to be comfortable with the visitation 
        policies that are in place.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>What 
        is &quot;work-study?&quot;</b><br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The Federal 
        Work-Study program is an important source of financial aid that provides 
        on-campus employment to students each year. Work-study awards are usually 
        for the fall and spring semesters. A student must submit a new financial 
        aid application for the summer semester. Students who are awarded work-study 
        should contact their financial aid office to learn how they need to go 
        about acquiring an on-campus job. Most campuses have a student employment 
        office that posts all of the openings for work-study and wage positions.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>How do 
        parents get a copy of their son/daughter&#146;s grades?</b><br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">While policies 
        regarding student&#146;s grades vary slightly from university to university, 
        most universities will tell parents that they must obtain these grades 
        from their students. Many universities send student grades to their permanent 
        address at the conclusion of each academic semester. Some universities 
        make final grades available to students on the Internet as well. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Why do 
        textbooks cost so much?</b><br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">There are 
        many factors that affect the prices of a textbook. These factors include 
        author royalties, publisher costs, marketing, publisher and author taxes, 
        and bookstore expenses. Most universities try to offer textbooks to students 
        through their university bookstore at a lower markup. Be sure to check 
        with the university regarding its &quot;buy back&quot; policies. Some 
        universities will buy back textbooks from students at the close of the 
        semester for a portion of the original price.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Is it 
        better to get a job on or off campus?</b><br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">While this 
        is certainly a personal choice for each student, there are a number of 
        benefits to locating employment on campus. On campus employers tend to 
        be more flexible with the student&#146;s work schedule as they realize 
        that the student employee is a &quot;student&quot; first and an &quot;employee&quot; 
        second. On campus employment does not require any form of transportation. 
        Students can easily walk to and from work if they reside on or close to 
        campus. Finally, working on campus gives students the opportunity to meet 
        faculty, staff and students on campus. It&#146;s a great way to network 
        and build connections on campus. Be sure to stop by your university&#146;s 
        student employment office while you&#146;re on campus for orientation. 
        You may be able to find a job before the fall semester begins.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Are most 
        college campuses safe?</b><br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">You will 
        find that most colleges and universities have many resources in place 
        to make their campuses reasonably safe places for the students. Most universities 
        have university police officers or security officers on patrol 24 hours 
        a day. The number of officers on campus and the extent of their duties 
        varies greatly dependent upon the size and location of the particular 
        university. Most universities will also offer a great deal of preventative 
        safety measures including things like educational workshops, escort services 
        abd emergency phones on campus. Residence halls will offer students additional 
        security measures. Many residence hall policies and procedures are designed 
        with the student&#146;s safety and security in mind. <br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Do I 
        need to have my own computer?</b><br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Many students 
        choose to bring a computer with them when they go to college. This is 
        certainly ideal as it gives them the convenience of having a computer 
        at their disposal whenever they need it. Whether checking e-mail, doing 
        research on the Internet or writing a paper, a computer of your own can 
        come in handy. While convenient, students can be just as successful if 
        they do not have a computer of their own. It just may take a little extra 
        effort on the part of the student. Most universities offer a number of 
        computer labs on campus that are available for students to use. Some of 
        these labs are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. So even if you 
        don&#146;t have your own computer, you can visit a computer lab on campus 
        and complete your work there. Use of the computer labs is normally a cost 
        covered in your general tuition fees.<br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>If I 
        purchase a computer for college should I buy a laptop or a desktop?</b><br>
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This is 
        merely a matter of preference for each student. Some students like the 
        laptop computers as it gives them a great deal of mobility. They can bring 
        it with them to classes, to a study lounge in their residence hall or 
        take it home with them on the weekends. While this convenience has its 
        advantages it also can present the potential problem of loss or theft. 
        While a desktop does not offer this same level of mobility, it is usually 
        less expensive and is less likely to be lost or stolen. Some universities 
        have a preference regarding what type of computer you should purchase. 
        There are many universities that require the purchase of a computer before 
        you arrive on campus or include the cost of a computer in your initial 
        fees as a new student. Be sure to check with the university you are attending 
        to get details.</font></p>
