       And if anybody knows about bouncing back after disaster, it's fortysomething Clare Wilson.  She's had it with being married to a serial cheater, and no way is he getting another chance.  Even her own son thinks she should have kicked his dad to the curb ages ago.  Now she's done it for good, and Clare is finally feeling the rush of unadulterated freedom.
       <p>
       But when a freak car crash lands Clare in the hospital, her life takes another detour.  She might be banged up and bruised, but suddenly men are coming out of the woodwork. Even her ex is pining for her.  It seems being an independent single woman is a powerful aphrodisiac.  But amidst all the lust, the last thing Clare expects to find is love.

<p>

Though visits from her secret lover, undercover DEA agent Jim Post, are as clandestine as they are passionate, somehow it fits with her demanding schedule as the town's doctor&#151;a calling that requires an innate ability to exist on caffeine, sticky buns and nerves of steel.
<p>
But how can a secret lover compete with a flesh and blood heartthrob from her past?&nbsp; June's old flame has just returned to town after twenty years&#151;and he's divorced. June is seriously rattled.&nbsp; So when the town's most devoted wife takes buckshot to her husband and some human bones turn up in her aunt Myrna's backyard, she's almost happy for the distraction.
<p>
Sooner or later, love with have its way in Grace Valley.&nbsp; It always does.

Welcome to Grace Valley, California - where blood runs thicker, ties bind stronger and love is all the more sweet.  <p>
Visitors to the town often remark about the valley's peace and beauty - both of which are plentiful.  Unlocked doors, front porches, pies cooling in the windows - this is country life at its finest.  But visitors don't always see what lies at the heart of a community.  Or just beyond....<p>
 June Hudson grew up in Grace Valley, the daughter of the town doctor.  Leaving only to get her medical training, she returned home and followed in her father's footsteps.  Some might say she chose the easy, comfortable route...but June knows better.  For June, her emergency room is wherever she's needed- or wherever a patient finds her.  Always on call, her work is her life, these people her extended family.  Which is a good thing, since this is a town where you should have picked your husband in the ninth grade.  Grace Valley is not exactly the place to meet eligible men- until an undercover DEA  agent suddenly starts appearing at all sorts of strange hours.  <p>
Everybody has secrets down in the valley.  Now June has one of her own.

Beth- her popular mysteries have become the only way she can fight back against the secret tyranny of her abusive husband.
