    research on the role of practice variables during the acquisition
    of motor skills is reviewed. These practice variables include
    (a) the effects of a model's skill level during observation,
    (b) how augmented feedback is provided two a learner and (c)
    how practice conditions are arranged when learning multiple tasks.
    The results of research in these areas suggest that cognitive
    processes play an important role during the early stages of skill
    acquisition. Moreover, the effort by which these cognitive processes
    are undertaken is influenced by practice variables. Motor learning
    is enhanced when these variables are manipulated to promote cognitive
    effort by a learner.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Despite their best intentions,
    people sometimes tend to be lazy thinkers during practice. For
    instance, hitting a bucket of golf balls at the driving range
    can be monotonous. At times, the swing seems to go into &quot;autopilot&quot;
    - the mind takes a short test, and individuals tend to repeat
    previously determined goals without giving the swing pattern
    much planning. On some days, much of the practice seems to be
    conducted on autopilot. What are the consequences of this type
    of practice?</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Early theoretical views
    of motor learning suggested that the motor commands and the sensory
    feedback that resulted from the movement were all that needed
    to be stored in memory for learning to occur. By this view, thinking
    was not too important for purposes or motor learning. More recent
    views stress the role of cognition in motor skills. In general,
    cognition refers to a collective group of thought processes.
    The hockey goalie tries to predict the direction of a shot by
    searching for perceptual clues that provide advance information.
    The golfer without a clear shot to the green tries to remember
    how to hit a controlled fade. The figure skater about to perform
    a triple axle jump followed immediately by a triple toe loop
    must prepare for this combined action with the flexibility in
    mind to change the plan if something goes wrong. All of these
    are examples of decision- making processes regarding the anticipation,
    planning, regulation and interpretation of motor performance.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Accepting that cognition
    plays an important function in performing motor skills, the question
    of the role of cognition during practice takes on more importance.
    Motor learning involves more than storing sensory and motor information
    that arises as a consequence of movement. Skill is highly cognitive,
    and the cognitive processes that subserve movement must be practiced
    as well. Our goal in this paper is to highlight some selected
    issues of major learning research that illustrate the importance
    of cognitive processes during practice.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">In this paper we present
    the differences that arise as a consequence of different practice
    conditions in terms of <I>cognitive effort</I>. In general, cognitive
    effort refers to the mental work involved in making decisions.
    In some cases, practice conditions result in more intense use
    of processing resources. In other cases research suggests that
    different types of decision-making processes are affected by
    practice conditions. Using cognitive effort as a focal point,
    one can view practice as an opportunity to either promote or
    impede the decision-making processes that underscore movement.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">In this paper, we develop
    the concept of cognitive effort from research on three distinct
    areas or motor learning research. First, we review some recent
    findings from research on modeling that watching an unskilled
    model learn a motor skill can benefit the observer by providing
    a vicarious opportunity to join the problem-solving process.
    This section is followed by a review of some findings that augmented
    feedback can sometimes be presented in such a way as to be detrimental
    to learning. The final area of research suggests that, while
    drill-type practice conditions can facilitate improvements during
    practice, such conditions also result in poor retention and transfer.
    Collectively, these three areas of research suggest that learning
    is promoted when the practice conditions promote cognitive effort</FONT></P>

    Learning<BR>
    </B>Demonstrating a motor skill to class of students is one of
    the fundamental tools in teaching. Despite a strong research
    base that supports the use of models, there are many instance
    in which the characteristics of the model determine its potential
    usefulness. For instance, few would challenge the assumption
    that experts in a motor skill make good models for the purposes
    of demonstration. But are experts always the best models to use?</P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Early theoretical support
    for the use of expert models was offered by Sheffield. According
    to his view, symbolic behavior could be coded and modeled by
    means of a <I>perceptual blueprint,</I> a precise representation
    of the perceptual demands or the task, The purpose of the blueprint
    was to serve both as a representation of what to do and as a
    referent for making corrections. Observation provided a means
    by which the perceptual blueprint could be acquired, and Sheffield's
    theory provided a rationale for the use of experts as optimal
    models.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">The use of expert models
    also has considerable pedagogical support, as one may discover
    from a visit to the sports instruction section of a video store</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">These tapes (on sports
    such as, golf tennis, skiing, bowling, etc.) often feature a
    repetitive view of top-level athletes demonstrating a particular
    motor skill- But, are these types of video useful? There are
    both theoretical and empirical reasons to be skeptical.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">In 1984, the United States
    National Academy of Sciences was asked by Army Research Institute
    to form a committee to investigate the value of various instructional
    techniques. One of the techniques investigated was a series of
    tapes known as SyberVision. The use of expert models from which
    to learn sport skills such as tennis, golf, or bowling was justified
    by their &quot;neuromuscular programming&quot; theory. According
    to the documentation provided by SyberVision, &quot;the more
    you see and hear pure movement, the deeper it becomes imprinted
    in your nervous system &#133; and the more likely you are to
    perform it as a conditioned reflex&quot;. However, the committee
    found no specific evidence that supported these claims.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">These conclusions, should
    not be all that surprising. The use of experts as models appears
    to encourage more the process of imitation than true learning
    through observation. When watching these videos, the observer
    is encouraged to mimic what the model has demonstrated. Bandura,
    a pioneer in the field of social modeling, discredits imitation
    as a method that minimizes the power of modeling. In his words,
    &quot;modeling imparts conceptions and rules for generating variant
    forms of behavior to suit different purposes and circumstances.
    In skill acquisition, modeling is more accurately represented
    as rule learning than as response mimicry&quot;.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">The repetitious nature
    of the skills demonstrated by experts in these videos also appears
    to imply that repeated exposure to a desirable performance will
    &quot;stamp in&quot; a representation of consistent, errorless
    performance. This assumption, however, appears to ignore the
    fact that errorless practice and role repetition are poor learning
    strategies.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Although research suggests
    that observational learning does occur using expert models, the
    findings suggest that a novice who is learning a motor skill
    can also be an effective model. Although most of this research
    is recent, it was anticipated many years ago by Twitmyer. He
    compared two groups of objects who learned to trace a pencil
    maze while blindfolded. Subjects in one group (the learning models),
    practiced the task on two different days. During his time, subjects
    in is second group (the observers) watched and recorded (he results
    of the learning models. These observers then performed the task
    on a third day. Since the learning models performed without previous
    observation of a model, their results were used as control data.
    The performance of the observers was better than the models'
    performance on the very first trial, and remained better throughout
    the learning session.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Although Twitmyer may
    have done the first study using unskilled models in an observation
    experiment, a study by Adams&nbsp; has sparked the recent search
    efforts. Similar to the Twitmyer method, a model practiced in
    the presence of an observer, after which the observer practiced
    the task. In Adams' study, the model practiced a movement timing
    task for 50 trials and observed under one of two conditions.
    The two groups of observers differed in terms the augmented feedback
    provided while observing: one group received the movement time
    augmented feedback that was delivered to the model whereas the
    other group did not receive this additional information (this
    feedback was crucial for the model to learn the task). Adams
    found that the observers performed better than the models, with
    the best performance achieved by the observers who also received
    the models' augmented feedback.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">But how effective is
    a learning model when directly compared to an expert model? A
    few studies have made this comparison, but the results are mixed.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Experiments by Weir and
    Leavitt and by Pollock and Lee found no differences due to the
    performance level of the model. For example, in the Pollock and
    Lee study, subjects watched a model perform 15 trials on a computer
    game that required pursuit tracking. The benefit due to previous
    observation was evident on the first post-observational trial,
    and this benefit remained throughout practise. There was no difference
    due to the model's skill level.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">However, a study by McCullagh
    and Caird did find that performance after watching a learning
    model was better than after watching an expert model. McCullagh
    and Cairds's task was similar to the task used by Adams. Subjects
    conducted a series of six acquisition blocks. Each block included
    watching five performances of a model, followed by five performance
    trials. The different observation groups watched either an expert
    model or a learning model. While watching the learning model,
    groups of observers either received the model's augmented feedback
    after each attempt or did not receive the feedback (similar to
    Adam's method).</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">The findings of the observers'
    performance trials during acquisition, an immediate retention
    test, a retention test 1 day later, and a delayed transfer test
    (to a novel timing goal) are clear. Observation of the learning
    model while also receiving the model's augmented feedback resulted
    in the best observational learning.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">While studies comparing
    the value of expert versus learning models in acquiring sport
    skills has begun, we can conjecture that at a minimum, observing
    a learning model will be no less effective than observing an
    expert model. In some circumstances, it may even be more effective.
    The skill level of the model has an impact on the observer's
    cognitive effort to learn from the motor behavior that was demonstrated.
    An expert model provides a precise representation of how a skilled
    action should be performed. However, a learning model more actively
    engages the observer in the problem solving processes that characterize
    learning. The observer can clearly observe the movement behavior
    of the model and the success of the model's subsequent attempts
    to reduce performance error. Indeed, observers have reported
    to us that it was difficult to suppress making comments to a
    live, learning model when the model failed to make an obvious
    correction of a movement behavior. On implication of this finding
    is that observing the possible errors that can be made on a task
    and the success of various attempts to solve these errors provides
    a conceptual insight into the cognitive basis of the task to
    be learned. Such a process seems well suited to the skill observation
    process.</FONT></P>

     FACE="MS Sans Serif">The Guiding</FONT><FONT SIZE="+1"> Influence
    of Augmented Feedback<BR>
    </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Augmented feedback
    refers to information that a learner does not normally receive
    directly from the senses. For example, a tennis player will know
    that the serve was not good because the ball hit the net. However,
    the exact reason for this result my not be obvious. Augmented
    feedback refers to making explicit something that might be difficult,
    if not impossible, to know implicitly. Usually this information
    is augmented by a teacher or coach using verbal statements or
    by means of visual aids. In this way, the information is &quot;fed
    back&quot; to the learner.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">For years, researchers
    and educators seemed content with the following general view
    on the role of augmented feedback in motor learning: The use
    of augmented feedback is most effective whenever it is provided
    as soon after performance as possible, as often as possible,
    and in such a way as to reduce performance errors as efficiently
    as possible. That view was challenged at few years ago by Richard
    Schmidt and his colleagues.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Schmidt made some rather
    startling conclusions after reexamining some previously published
    experiments and conducting new studies. The first conclusion
    was that the general view on augmented feedback given above was
    based largely on data gathered during practice. Schmidt argued
    that this was weak methodology since changes during practice
    reflected temporary influences on performance and not always
    true learning effects. A better assessment of learning was provided
    by retention and transfer tests after temporary effects no longer
    exerted an influence on performance. The second conclusion was
    that if the augmented feedback literature was re-evaluated using
    retention and transfer data, the evidence pointed to a view that
    was quite different from the prevailing view. We begin by considering
    some of the augmented feedback variables and their effects on
    learning, then describe Schmidt's ideas about the guiding role
    of augmented feedback on motor learning.</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT FACE="MS Sans Serif"></FONT></B><A NAME="Error Estimation"></A><B><FONT
     FACE="MS Sans Serif">Error Estimation</FONT><FONT SIZE="+1">
    and Temporal Delay<BR>
    </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">One view for
    optimizing the benefits of augmented feedback was to present
    the feedback as soon after movement as possible. Findings indicated
    a different interpretation. In these studies, augmented feedback
    was provided either instantaneously with the completion of a
    movement or after an 8-second delay. Subjects that received this
    short delay during practice either sat silently during the interval
    or attempted to estimate the magnitude of the augmented feedback
    that they were about to receive. Learning was assessed when subjects
    again performed the task 10 minutes and 2 days after the practice
    period. All groups performed without augmented feedback during
    these retention tests.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">There was little difference
    between the groups during the practice (acquisition) period.
    However, a pattern of results began to emerge after 10 minutes
    that was further clarified on the 2-day retention test. This
    pattern of results indicated (a) relatively good retention following
    practice in which estimation of the augmented feedback was made
    during the delay period and (b) relatively poor results for the
    group that was given instantaneous augmented feedback. The delayed
    group performed at an intermediate level. These findings not
    only argued against the prevailing view of providing feedback
    as soon as possible after a movement but suggested that, in fact,
    such a procedure could be detrimental to learning. Moreover,
    the results suggested that estimating the magnitude of the error
    prior to receiving the augmented feedback had an additional benefit
    to learning beyond that of simply delaying the feedback.</FONT><B><FONT

     FACE="MS Sans Serif">Summary Feedback<BR>
    </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Summary feedback
    is related to the temporal delay of feedback discussed above.
    In this method, feedback is delayed until after a series of trials
    have been completed; feedback is then provided in a manner that
    summarizes the receding trialsAn experiment by Schmidt, Young,
    Shapiro and Swinnen illustrates the effects of summary feedback</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Subjects in this study
    were divided into four groups according to the number of trials
    that were summarized on a graph and presented to the subject
    as augmented feedback. In the &quot;Sum 1&quot; group, feedback
    was provided after every trial. In the &quot;Sum 5&quot;, &quot;Sum
    10&quot; and &quot;Sum 15&quot; groups, feedback was provided
    on a graph about the 5, 10 or 15 preceding trials, illustrating
    how performance either changed or remained consistent over trials.
    Immediate and delayed teas of retention followed the practice
    period.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Two sets of findings
    are important. First acquisition performance was negatively related
    to size of the summary; the larger the summary the poorer the
    acquisition performance. Second, delayed retention performance
    was achieved by the &quot;Sum 15&quot; and &quot;Sum 10&quot;
    groups, and the worst performance by the &quot;Sum 5&quot; and
    &quot;Sum 1&quot; groups. These findings are particularly interesting
    because or the opposite effects that the summary conditions had
    on the practice performance and on learning and because of the
    direct findings to teaching sport skills.</FONT><B><FONT SIZE="+1"></FONT></B></P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1"></FONT></B><A NAME="Relative Frequency"></A><B><FONT
     FACE="MS Sans Serif">Relative Frequency<BR>
    </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">The frequency
    of providing augmented feedback was another of the prevailing
    views that was challenged by Schmidt. The belief was that the
    absolute frequency of augmented feedback (i.e. the number of
    times that feedback was provided) was a critical variable in
    learning, but that relative frequency (the ratio of feedback-provided
    trials to the total number of trials) was not an important variable
    for learning. However, much of the evidence to support this view
    was based on data from the practice period rather than from retention
    tests. In their review of this literature, Salmoni et all. (1984)
    found a few studies that included retention tests following relative
    frequency manipulations. Surprisingly, these studies showed that
    relative frequency might indeed be an important variable in learning
    - that <I>low</I> relative frequencies might he better than <I>high</I>
    relative frequencies of augmented feedback. Subsequent studies
    have since confirmed these effects.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">An interesting corollary
    to the relative frequency effects has also emerged. Using a movement
    timing task, Sherwood provided subjects with augmented feedback
    only when their errors exceeded certain tolerance limits about
    the goal. For one group of subjects, augmented feedback was provided
    on every trial (a &quot;0% bandwidth&quot;). For other subjects,
    augmented feedback was provided only when performance error was
    greater than +/- 5%, or greater than +/- 10% of the goal. By
    this manipulation, Sherwood also influenced the frequency schedule
    by which augmented feedback was provided (since feedback was
    not provided for trials on which performance was within the bandwidth
    limits).</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Early in practice, when
    many errors occurred, the relative frequency of augmented feedback
    was fairly high. However, as performance improvements were made
    over practice, the relative frequency became less frequent. Performance
    on a retention test was best for the group that had received
    the 10% bandwidth and poorest for the 0% bandwidth group, with
    the 5% group performing at an intermediate level. At a minimum,
    these findings are consistent with the effects of reduced relative
    frequency, although it seems that the bandwidth manipulation
    has an additional learning effect. The other similarity is that
    &quot;fading&quot; the relative frequency of feedback over practice
    (giving frequent feedback early in practice and infrequently
    later) is both an effective strategy and one that occurs as a
    natural consequence of the bandwidth procedure.</FONT></P>

    for Augmented Feedback<BR>
    </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Collectively,
    these findings have been interpreted by Schmidt as evidence in
    support of a guidance role (or augmented feedback. Although augmented
    feedback can be useful under the right circumstances, providing
    augmented feedback can be detrimental to learning under other
    conditions. In general, these conditions occur (a) when augmented
    feedback is necessary for learning to occur and (b) when augmented
    feedback is presented such that it guides the learner toward
    certain corrective actions. In these cases, the learner becomes
    too reliant upon the augmented feedback to correct movement errors.
    For example, the provision of instantaneous feedback during practice
    tends to detract the learner from interpreting intrinsic sources
    of feedback, such as vision and proprioception. Schmidt suggests
    that it is these sources of feedback that one must learn to interpret
    since they will always be available to the learner. Augmented
    feedback (such as the feedback received from a teacher) will
    not always be available (e.g., during a game). Indeed, the goal
    in most learning situations is for the learner to become independent
    of the teacher. Learning to rely upon the information provided
    by these people will ultimately be detrimental to achieving independence.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">From a different perspective,
    the Swinnen showed that encouraging subjects to estimate their
    augmented feedback produced a benefit to learning beyond that
    achieved by simply delaying the instantaneous provision of the
    feedback. This suggests that the cognitive effort in attempting
    to learn to interpret one&#146;s own intrinsic feedback, in combination
    with augmented feedback, can be a potent influence on learning.
    Augmented feedback might be most beneficial to learning when
    it serves to augment the cognitive efforts in learning self-evaluation
    skills using the sources of information that will be available
    during competition.</FONT><B><FONT SIZE="+1"></FONT></B></P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1"></FONT></B><A NAME="Contextual Interference"></A><B><FONT
     FACE="MS Sans Serif">Contextual Interference<BR>
    </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Another intriguing
    research issue investigated in recent years is the contextual
    interference effect. This finding was first studied by Shea and
    Morgan and has been replicated many times since. In the Shea
    and Morgan study, two groups of subjects each learned these simple
    laboratory tasks. All aspects of the practice were identical
    with the exception of the order in which the tasks were practiced.
    Under the blocked order, all practice trials on one of the tasks
    were completed before another task was undertaken. This procedure
    is similar to practice &quot;drills&quot; because of the repetitive
    nature of the practice.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">In contrast, the other
    group practiced the tasks in a random order, such that they were
    switching from one task to another throughout practice. The random
    order resulted in considerably more interference between tasks
    compared to a blocked order. Thus, it was not too surprising
    that random practice resulted in much poorer acquisition performance
    than blocked practice.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">What was rather surprising
    were the results of these two groups on retention tests conducted
    minutes and days later. On both retention tests the random group
    performed better than the blocked group.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">These results resemble
    the findings of the summary experiment earlier, in which the
    same conditions that led to poor acquisition performance also
    led to very good retention. However, in the case of random and
    blocked practice orders, it was not the manipulation of augmented
    feedback but the interference arising from the order by which
    the tasks were practiced that produced the results. Hence, the
    cause for the contextual interference findings has been discussed
    in terms of different theoretical constraints than described
    for the augmented feedback findings.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">One account for the contextual
    interference effect is that random practice encourages a learner
    to compare and contrast the methods and strategies used for performing
    the different tasks. Switching between tasks during practice
    provides the learner with better contrastive knowledge than the
    drill, repetitive-type practice that occurs under a blocked order.
    This contrast between tasks makes learning each task more distinctive
    and memorable, resulting in the advantages seen later in retention.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Another explanation for
    the contextual interference effect can best be described using
    an analogy. If you are asked to mentally multiply two numbers
    (e.g. 34 x 26=?), it would take some work, but could be done
    with effort. If the same question were asked a short time later,
    the answer could be given right away if the solution from the
    previous menial effort was still in working memory.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">If however, that answer
    had been forgotten, then the question would have to be solved
    again. Lee and Magill used a similar idea to explain the contextual
    interteretice effect. Random practice requires a learner to approach
    a task by developing a strategy or plan of action. However, such
    a plan is inappropriate to maintain in memory since the task
    on the next trial is different. Thus, a new plan of action needs
    to be developed. By the time the previous task is performed again,
    the plan that had been developed for it last time has been lost
    from memory, and a new plan of action must be developed. This
    process continues throughout random practice. In contrast, the
    same plan of action can be used again and again during blocked
    practice since the same task is practiced repeatedly. The consequence
    is that having learned to develop a plan of action when necessary
    (under random practice) makes the learning both more memorable
    and better suited for novel performance simulations.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Both theoretical orientations
    to the contextual interference effect have received quite a bit
    of empirical attention. It is also interesting to note that there
    have been a number of experiments undertaken to examine the contextual
    interference effect in acquiring sport skills, and the findings
    appear to replicate the findings from laboratory experiments
    quite well. Practice and retention /transfer findings showing
    the &quot;typical&quot; blocked/random differences have been
    found for learning badminton serves and in rifle shooting.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Most of the laboratory
    experiments and field tests of contextual interference effects
    have been conducted using subjects who were unskilled at the
    tasks to be learned. However, in a recent study. Hall, Domingues,
    and Cavazos found interesting contextual interference effects
    for athletes who had already achieved a high level of performance.
    In this study, college-level baseball players received two sessions
    of extra batting practice per week for 6 weeks. One group of
    subjects received 15 curve balls, 15 fast balls and 15 change-ups
    in a blocked order during each session. Another group of subjects
    received the same number and types of pitches in a random order.
    A control group of subjects received no extra batting practice.
    Scores (in terms of the number of solid hits) were recorded on
    a random pretest, on two practice sessions (Sessions 5 and 8),
    and on both a randomly ordered and a blocked ordered transfer
    test.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Several points of interest
    from the Hall study are notable. First, the extra batting practice
    improved performance as noted by the better performance on the
    transfer tests by both the random and blocked groups, compared
    to the control group. Second, performance during the practice
    sessions was generally better by the blocked group than for the
    random group. Third, transfer performance was better for the
    random practice group than for the blocked practice group, regardless
    of the order in which the transfer trials were conducted. The
    most exciting aspect of these results however, was that this
    &quot;typical&quot; contextual interference effect was found
    for subjects who had previously achieved a high level of performance
    on the criterion task.</FONT><B><FONT SIZE="+1"></FONT></B></P>

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1"></FONT></B><A NAME="Cognitive Effort"></A><B><FONT
     FACE="MS Sans Serif">Cognitive Effort<BR>
    </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">The three areas
    of research discussed above provide rather diverse examples of
    cognitive effort in motor skill learning. In each area of research
    we have provided examples that illustrate how conditions of practice
    either promoted or diminished the decision-making activities
    of the subject learning a motor skill.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Some instructors feel
    that watching the expert execute the same sport skill time and
    again, with flawless precision, should engender some type of
    passive diffusion of that knowledge into the observer. The advantages
    seen by observing a learning model suggest an advantage gained
    through a rather different process. In this case, the observer
    is watching the model attempt a performance. If the observer
    is also able to receive some feedback about the success of that
    performance, then the observer is in the position to judge, independent
    of the model, what would be appropriate to do next. In short,
    the observer becomes actively involved, albeit vicariously, in
    the process of learning. The observer joins the learning model
    in the trial-and-error process.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Augmented feedback is
    a means of supplementing the sources of feedback normally available
    to an individual. As a source of information that complements
    the always present sources, augmented feedback serves a restrictive
    role. Optimally, augmented feedback should be used to help a
    person to interpret the sources of feedback that are always available.
    Augmented feedback should provide a knowledge referent, or &quot;reliability
    check,&quot; to insure that intrinsic sources of feedback are
    correctly being interpreted. For example, the reasons for an
    errant golf shot are often available from watching the flight
    of the ball. How to interpret this intrinsic feedback, however,
    is something that must be learned. The optimal role of augmented
    feedback is to assist the learner to correctly interpret this
    intrinsic feedback.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">For augmented feedback
    to serve its most useful role, it must be given in such a way
    that it helps without discouraging the performer from learning
    to interpret intrinsic feedback. Learning to interpret one&#146;s
    own intrinsic feedback requires cognitive effort. However, that
    learning can he weakened if the augmented feedback serves a role
    in which it undermines the effort to learn to interpret one&#146;s
    own intrinsic feedback. There is no need for the learner to try
    to interpret the intrinsic feedback when augmented feedback is
    provided instantaneously upon movement completion and when it
    follows every trial. In a way, cognitive effort is suppressed,
    yet performance improves quite well without it. Encouraging the
    interpretation of performance, reducing the relative frequency
    (combined with performance bandwidths), and increasing the summary
    sizes of augmented feedback all positively impact the cognitive
    effort to interpret intrinsic sources of information.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Practice drills are good
    procedures for learning skills. However, many motor skills that
    are undertaken daily do not involve repetitive actions. This
    problem became clear recently when one of us was teaching a boy
    how to tie his shoes. The thought processes that he undertook
    in tying his shoes were clearly evident by the slow and deliberate
    actions of his fingers as work. These were repeated on the next
    shoe, but to a far less degree. We wonder what would have happened
    if he had been asked to keep practicing for 15 minutes. No doubt,
    success would have come more quickly and easily. However, would
    success have been achieved any easier the next morning? Evidence
    regarding the contextual interference effect suggests not.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Solving a problem by
    recalling a recent solution bypasses the cognitive effort involved
    in the decision-making process. When a task requires that these
    decisions be learned, conditions should be arranged such that
    these decisions are practiced. Arranging practice conditions
    that serve to avoid this cognitive effort hinders the learning
    process.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">Learning motor skills
    involves also learning cognitive skills. We have provided three
    instances of research that collectively suggest that the cognitive
    effort expected during practice has a critical impact on the
    learning process. The functional independence of students and
    athletes lies in their ability to think and act on their own.
    Promoting that purpose in practice and training sessions is compatible
    with that goal.</FONT></P>

    <P><B><FONT FACE="MS Sans Serif"></FONT></B><A NAME="A Caveat"></A><B><FONT
     FACE="MS Sans Serif">A Caveat </FONT><FONT SIZE="+1">for Instructors<BR>
    </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">An interesting
    question was recently posed by Robert Bjork: &quot;if the research
    picture is so clear, then why are massed practice, excessive
    feedback, fixed conditions of training and limited opportunities
    for retrieval practice - among other non-productive manipulations
    - such common features of real world training conditions?&quot;.
    There are several answers to the question. One could be that
    the research picture is not all that clear. In this paper we
    have built an argument for the role of cognitive effort in learning
    motor skills based on a limited set of data. The generalizability
    of these ideas await further research.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">If the research picture
    is accurate however, then Bjork argues that nonproductive training
    manipulations continue to be used for as least two further reasons.
    One relates to the performance / learning distinction. Some of
    the temporary benefits to performance seen during practice favored
    the use of practice manipulations that actually resulted in poor
    retention One example is contextual interference. If an instructor
    were to value a practice manipulation in terms of how quickly
    a standard of performance was achieved then blocked training
    would be seen as a much better arrangement of practice orders
    than random training. However, an appreciation for the assessment
    of learning in terms of retention and transfer would produce
    the opposite conclusion. Related to this same issue is the fact
    that instructors of training programs may only he involved with
    the learner for the period of time during which the practice
    occurs. Perhaps they are satisfied with the benefits to performance
    seen by their training methods, or perhaps they are not aware
    of the impact their training regimes have on longer term retention
    or transfer after their involvement with the learner has been
    completed.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">The second reason given
    by Bjork for the continued use of nonproductive training conditions
    is due to the subjective experiences of the learner. Rapid improvements
    on a motor skill are reassuring, and the learner may develop
    illusions about time progress made on a skill as a result of
    conditions of practice that favor rapid, short-term) benefits.
    These incorrect subjective sometimes anecdotal assessments tend
    so foster continued belief in the training programs. In contrast,
    training programs that are structured to promote cognitive effort
    during learning may not be given full value by the subjective
    experiences of the learner because of the decelerated rates of
    improvement that may occur.</FONT></P>

    <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="MS Sans Serif">For these reasons the
    instructor is faced with roles of both assisting the learner
    with the skill to be learned and educating the learner about
    learning.</FONT></P>
