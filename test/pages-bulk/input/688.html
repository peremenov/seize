       <p>&#147;Those who scorn inflation today will hail it tomorrow <br>
        as the last bastion of profitability&#148;...Ed Bugos</p>
      <p><b>Rising Wedgies<br>
        </b>Some market technicians, including myself, view the rising wedge
        as a completion pattern. It is not an easy pattern to discern, especially
        if the market has fooled you with so many more easily visible bearish
        sucker plays. A rising wedge, as distinct from the corrective bounce
        that is often interpreted as a flag when it takes on the same shape and
        shorter duration, is often a final extension to a long running bull leg.
        Even if one is seen, it is difficult to believe because of the bullishly
        misleading sequence of higher highs and higher lows coming at a high
        point in confidence for the market. </p>
      <p>Yet, even though not a certainty until prices begin to fall from and
        therefore confirm the pattern, its implications are thought to be large
        enough that many speculators try to anticipate the break. In theory,
        these patterns are defined by a narrowing in the rising price channel
        on diminishing volume, and can last anywhere from two to six months,
        sometimes even a little longer. A diminishing, or petering out, in fresh
        investment interest explains both their price behavior and volume behavior.
        And when they do fall out of this humdrum pattern, the degree of the
        move is almost always substantial. </p>

        come from <a href="http://www.stockcharts.com">www.stockcharts.com</a>,

      <p>I have deliberately omitted marking up the charts so that you may make
        your own interpretation, but I am sure that you will find, in all cases,
        that long existing trends are already in place, that volumes have visibly
        diminished over the past six months (of course it is summer, but a wedge
        is a wedge), that the intermediate trend channels have noticeably narrowed,
        and that outside of GE, momentum has been generally diverging, even so
        far into September. Ask yourself, where is this index without these component
        stocks? Naturally, if this assessment proves correct...</p>

      <p>In both of the blue chip indexes above, momentum appears so negligible
        as to cast aside the significance of the breakout in the broader NYSE
        composite (to the right), which itself almost appears to be developing
        a six month rising wedge. However, that being said, there is indeed a
        few things happening in the stock market that deserve special attention.</p>
      <p><b>A potential theoretically perfect negative correlation</b><br>
        Wall Street bulls will sell the powerful rally in the Dow Utilities Average
          as a double whammy. If their slow growth scenario pans out, these puppies
          should benefit from the lower interest rate environment, they will
          claim. If the energy crisis escalates on the other hand, there is a
          powerfully bullish story in that direction for the Utilities! Before
          I go on, which of the two preceding outcomes do you think that the
          below charts have already been discounting?</p>

      <p>If you guessed the latter, you are dead on. At least four American Utility
        icons are positioned to take advantage of a growing global need for alternate
        power infrastructures less reliant on oil and gas. These companies are
        clearly the global leaders of choice in such an undertaking, many of
        them having been around as long as the Fed and perhaps more necessary,
        if the energy problem literally turns into a crisis. Therefore, I would
        suggest that the developing negative correlation with the Dow Transports
        supports this latter, more interesting growth story. </p>
      <p>While both averages may benefit from lower interest rates, only one
        can truly benefit from an energy crisis. The following companies have
        spent significant resources, and perhaps even time, positioning themselves
        to benefit from this, globally. They have the knowledge and capital to
        offer many oil dependent economies an alternative, higher tech solution
        to their energy problems. So put down your Benjamin Graham textbook and

      <p>Glancing at these stock charts, one might conclude that there are some
        big things happening here. Undeniably, he or she would be correct. There
        are, but again, they have nothing to do with lower interest rates or
        defensive investing, and they have everything to do with increasingly
        bullish expectations for global demand to step up for alternative power
        infrastructures. Comically, if Wall Street really gets behind this &#147;remarkable&#148; story,
        they will have to denounce their Goldilocks allegiance! There is no double
        whammy here. Let me put it to you this way; without a potential oil crisis,
        there is no real potential for this Utilities play. </p>
      <p>Additionally, if OPEC's 800,000 daily barrel addition doesn't quell
        oil prices immediately this week and inflation numbers come in on the
        high side of expectations, momentum may carry these stocks further, at
        least for a week or so. However, I personally am inclined to wait out
        the highly probable second bear leg in the rest of the market to unfold
        first. That's right, second. </p>
      <p><b>On the other hand, go Goldilocks go</b><br>
        Rumors surfaced in Germany midweek that Europe's biggest banking group,
          Deutsche Bank AG, is in talks to acquire the mighty JP Morgan. Can
          anybody appreciate the politics behind this supposed deal as much as
          I can? I never saw it coming. Anyway, by the end of the week, Morgan's
          CFO, Peter Hancock handed in his resignation to pursue longstanding
          entrepreneurial interests. In the end, this may turn out to be nothing
          but a difference in opinion, at worst. But if it were nothing, why
          would he not put off his resignation until after this whole thing was
          over, being sort of a key person in a major acquisition and all? Anyway
          you slice it; it still is a red flag. </p>
      <p>Is the US investment business for sale? This is the thought that had
        crossed my mind when I first heard this merger talk on Wednesday, before
        Mr. Hancock's resignation. It is the thought that crossed my mind when
        DLJ sold out to Credit Suisse Group recently. The seed for that thought,
        however, actually occurred immediately after the UBS acquisition of Paine
        Webber. The reason is that I had just finished The <a href="showarticle.cfm?id=8">Politics
        of the Dollar</a>, where I had put forth that the US is now vulnerable
        to political extortion on account of potentially discontent foreign dollar
        owners. In other words, the balance of political power will shift to
        foreign dollar owners as long as US politicians will want to keep them
        from selling off the currency (to prevent inflation). Let me explain.</p>
      <p>These events have been driving M&A speculation in the US financial sector
        to new heights, dragging along with it the Dollar/Euro exchange rate.
        The big monetary problem facing the financial system is the circulation
        of excess dollars. Therefore, I suggest that it is in the US interest,
        in order to forestall a dollar crisis at this point, to convert foreign
        short-term deposits into long-term foreign direct investment. And I believe
        that it is in Europe's dollar owner's interests to find something useful
        to do with all of their excess dollars. So while the Europeans are busy
        buying US banks from day traders at record highs, American financial
        interests may be buying failed Asian banks, cheaply. This is nothing
        but an observation at this point but it is interesting, because in my
        second to last report, <a href="showarticle.cfm?id=10">Inflation versus
        Deflation</a>, I suggest that Japan is a net global creditor and therefore
        most likely to survive the currency debacle that is right around the
        corner.</p>
      <p>Even worse, however, is that these headlines take away from all the
        other garbage that the Europeans are buying. I have observed, in previous
        research, the relationship between the falling Euro and the rising issuance
        of US Asset Backed Commercial Paper, specifically finance company debt
        or consumer installment credit. My conclusion was that the US financial
        sector has been monetizing low quality debt in this last cycle. This
        argument can also be found in the report <a href="showarticle.cfm?id=10">Inflation
        versus Deflation</a>. Interestingly, in an August 31 issue of "Capital
        Issues<sup>2</sup>," entitled "Watch Reserves, not Rates", the author
        points to a striking 0.88 correlation between US commercial bank paper
        and the European Central Bank assets. This is the first time I had read
        their quality work.</p>
      <p><b>&#147;Operation Discredit GATA,&#148; is well under way!</b><br>
        Normally, I stay away from arguing any claims that I cannot properly
          bear out, which is why you will find little on the topic of manipulation,
          other than the occasional restrained inference, in any of my other
          research. There are two reasons for this. First, conspiracy theories
          are far too easy to discredit, and should the allegations actually
          be true, the theorists will surely be targeted. Second, I have long
          ago accepted that many markets, especially gold, just simply get manipulated
          anyhow. Why wouldn't they? In fact, Mr. Greenspan himself said this
          recently while speaking about the rapid pace of change and innovation
          in the international financial system: </p>
      <p><i>The rapidly changing international financial climate is certain to
          create nostalgia for the gold standard among those of us engaged to
          replace it - Paraphrase.</i> </p>
      <p>Some skilled traders, as well as myself, purport to see it in the tape
        on far more occasions than the average person might want to believe.
        The whacked out gold/silver ratios, gold/oil ratios, and gold/asset ratios
        are enough to at least legitimize any inquiry into such manipulation.
        Global bankers who declare that it represents an unprofitable investment
        in the new economy easily meet every rise in the demand for gold with
        their own supply, unwittingly improving its fundamentals with each ounce
        that is sold from their vaults to the public. And even while global monetary
        fundamentals arguably improve to gold's advantage relative to the international
        reserve currency's outlook, revealing an enormously conspicuous anomaly
        on the chart, the World Gold Council claims that it is certain that there
        exists no such manipulation.</p>
      <p>It is common knowledge that the Fed manipulates interest rates, and
        until recently, money supply as well. It is also well understood that
        the government manipulates (under the guise of regulation or some misguided
        policy directive) many other economic dynamics in our interest, presumably.
        Do we need a special briefing by the CIA to believe what we already know
        is likely true? The question therefore is why are they trying so hard
        to deny it? Perhaps because it is so difficult to come up with a plausible
        argument as to why it is in our best interest, but possibly also because
        they have learnt how effective outright denial of any wrongdoing can
        be, especially in dealing with a public that has a vested interest in
        their paper. </p>
      <p>Whatever the case may be it can be treacherous as a professional trader
        not to assume that someone is playing market games. There is always a
        shepherd. </p>
      <p><b>The Harder They Try, The More Obvious They Become</b> <br>
        So suddenly, I find myself talking about a subject that I had always
          personally viewed as an overly mashed potato. The reason is that as
          a broker, when a promoter would approach me with a deal and become
          aggravated by my questions, he would pull out a thick technical report,
          sometimes as long as 100 pages or more, in the hope that I would be
          satisfied with the project simply because someone else already undertook
          the due diligence, presumably on my behalf. Though, to his negative
          surprise, upon reading through the mumbo jumbo, I would find not only
          that I had even more annoying questions, but also that I suddenly knew
          more about the entire venture than he did. </p>
      <p>Similarly, Dr. Jessica Cross' recent 200-page report called &#147;Gold
        Derivatives Growth Unsustainable&#148; released on 4 September 2000,
        has literally dragged me out of the closet on this mashed potato. </p>
      <p><b>The Definition of Spin</b><br>
        Lots of spin is going on out there these days, though it used to be called
          nonsense in the old economy. My 1984 Pocket Oxford uses terms like
          spinning, twisting, and manipulating a yarn to define the term in its
          linguistically intended form. But by far, Mr. Don Mathews at mises.org
          wrote the most interesting definition I have ever come by, which I
          view as relevant to	the business of money also. In an article titled &#147;Gore
          on Oil,&#148; he said that: </p>
      <p><i>His (Gore's) charge of conspiracy and price gouging is spin. Spin
          is the political class euphemism for calculated mendacity, for planned
          distortion, for twisting and contorting fact and reason until truth
          becomes all but impossible to decipher. In the normal world, spin is
          thought of with disgust. But in the political world, spin is a tool,
          and the handiest tool at that; and those who use spin with skill rise
          high in politics.</i></p>
      <p>In the financial business as well, he should have added. For as the
        price of gold declines and bankers continue to satisfy excess demand
        with their own gold &#147;reserves,&#148; the spin they have found most
        opportunistic is that gold's monetary significance has diminished. And
        they have done much to <i>twist and contort fact and reason until truth
        has become all but impossible to decipher</i>. In fact, the same brute
        force tactics appear to have evolved in the financial stocks of late
        mention, and the spin they weave (if that makes sense) is European endorsement
        of the legitimacy of US financial interests.</p>
      <p><b>Where is the Motive, they ask?</b><br>
        Oddly, unlike manipulating interest rates or exchange rates or oil prices
          or dairy prices or labor prices or what have you, &#147;speaking&#148; about
          the manipulation in gold prices is a grave taboo. </p>
      <p>And there is an excellent reason for that. It is simply this: There
        has never been such a comparably long period of paper money prosperity
        as during this past thirty years or so, evidently. It is normally perceived
        that this kind of prosperity would not be possible on a gold standard;
        in as short a time as it is without one, at least. That is because on
        a gold standard, we have to accept some monetary discipline from time
        to time. On a &#147;paper&#148; monetary system, we can-will-and-have
        postponed the unkind &#147;discipline,&#148; despite the fact that it
        comes at the expense of what is referred to as the lender-of-last-resort
        model. At some nearby point in the future this will probably come at
        an enormous cost. Conversely, on a theoretically proper gold standard,
        the average entrepreneur can at least be reasonably confident that he
        can keep any wealth that is conquered for longer than, say a couple of
        decades.</p>
      <p>We have established this position many times in the past, and if you
        would like to review our arguments, please visit our <a href="index.cfm">homepage</a> and
        pick out any one of our archived reports. You ought to at least agree
        that there has been a visible lack of financial discipline in recent
        years, whatever that may mean to you. So, when Dr. Jessica Cross suggests,
        through the FAZ<sup>3</sup>, that organizations like GATA have not even
        touched on possible motive, she has clearly under read the content at
        any of the websites that we publish through, including GATA's. </p>
      <p>In short form, it is my contention that ultimately this cost will manifest
        in a loss of confidence and purchasing power of the paper currency with
        the weakest fundamentals, which have less to do with any deceptive productivity
        edge, than they have to do with other more complex monetary issues, such
        as the natural consequences of profligate dollar imperialism. Nevertheless,
        by then we shall see where all of the false wealth has been transferred
        to, and we may then possibly even lose faith in the spin weaving banking
        system - dare I say it. And if we were so brave as to try and revert
        back to the coherent economic logic behind "sound money," which was responsible
        for many of the enormous and real economic expansions of previous centuries,
        the Federal Reserve System that was developed in 1908 may have to completely
        dismantle. That certainly explains the taboo, don't you think</p>
      <p>Let me warn right now, that this line of reasoning, as logical as it
        indeed may be, ranks very high on the controversy scale. Why don't you
        practice it on your nearest neighbor and watch his or her haughty reaction,
        just for fun? This does not mean the argument is wrong, but will only
        reveal that your neighbor owns stocks. It took a long, long time for
        the Fed to become as powerful as it is today, where millions and millions
        of investors watch Mr. Greenspan's every single move, as if they knew
        what to do with the worthless information.</p>
      <p>Given all of these circumstances, how hard do you think that it would
        be for any powerful financial interest today to persuade an "expert" to
        denounce such manipulation that everyone already knows exists? And if
        our economics are right, which they probably are, the motive for manipulating
        gold prices could not be greater at any time in history than it is today.</p>
      <p><b>The Irony of Power</b><br>
        The only real mistake that the Fed had ever made, in terms of defending
          its power, was to allow the monetary inflation to overcome the economy
          and manifest in profuse quantities of low quality securities, which
          are now owned by too many weak hands. Here is the irony; these &#147;hands&#148; now
          have the power to decide the Fed's destiny. So yes, expect the &#147;expert&#148; nonsense
          to intensify, as there are few markets other than gold, where &#147;they&#148; may
          still exert an advantageous, and more direct influence. The next few
          years should prove very interesting to this argument.</p>
      <p><b>Gold And Paper Have Become Mutually Exclusive</b><br>
        In her report, Dr. Jessica Cross examines the whole argument about gold
          derivatives and whether there exists any manipulation of gold prices
          at all. When I first glanced at the 200-page phase one project, I thought
          to myself, what a waste of %#&! time and money. Mine too. Nonetheless,
          it is my obligation to answer the call. In the preamble, Jessica states
          that:</p>
      <p><i>&#147;As Virtual Metals noted in the initial proposal for this study,
          any detailed research into the derivative phenomenon would probably
          generate as many questions as it provided answers. This has indeed
          been the case and consequently, it is acknowledged that further work
          is	warranted. &#148;</i> </p>
      <p>Here are a few of my &#147;initial&#148; stupid questions: <br>
        1. Who is going to actually study this enormous intimidating looking
          pile of bureaucratic nonsense before the presidential election is over? <br>
        2. Why did the World Gold Council assert their confidence in previous
        numbers at the Gold Conference in France only a few months ago, if they
        had yet to even complete such a study? <br>
        3. If there are many more questions now than before, where does she get
        off making any conclusions whatsoever about anything?</p>
      <p>I suppose that one has to justify the scarce resources (she apparently
        is doing this work for the supposedly impoverished gold industry) allocated
        to this project undertaking that appears to be motivated mainly to discredit
        GATA's conclusions, and that is going to be hard to do if the conclusion
        is that GATA may actually be right.</p>
      <p><b>Everybody Has A Vested Interest in Something</b><br>
        The FAZ reported the discovery that many of GATA's supporters have personal
          monetary interests behind their accusations. I am glad they noticed.
          I certainly do.</p>
      <p>If these people want to accuse the little pissed off guys of having
        a vested interest in what they are talking about, I demand that they
        show me an example where that isn't the case for anyone else!!! I gather
        that I do not need to list many examples here. </p>
      <p>The WGC and GFMS, representing the gold industry, unquestionably have
        a vested interest in keeping gold prices down, for example. At least
        until the industry's most important producers unwind their offside hedges.
        The evidence suggests that a significant &#147;majority&#148; of gold
        producers could lose a lot of money should gold prices double too quickly.
        In fact, such an event could easily escalate as the weaker producers
        would run into solvency problems and consequently, into production delays
        because they suddenly cannot afford to finance their daily operation.
        So yes, even the gold industry has a bearish vested interest in the Gold
        business today!</p>
      <p>If these &#147;people&#148; really want to use that angle, I am sure
        that GATA can multiply it tenfold! </p>
      <p><b>The Prisoner's Dilemma</b><br>
        Almost one year ago now, on the eve of the signing of the Washington
          Agreement, a friend of mine dubbed the situation a &#147;prisoner's
          dilemma&#148; because as long as no one else would cover their shorts
          all would be Ok, but under this theoretical quandary, such an outcome
          is obviously a Utopian fantasy. The Dr. Jessica Cross document looks
          more like a &#147;prisoner's tale&#148; than a revelation, created
          only to buy the prisoners some badly needed time while they all continue
          to cheat on each other. Though I have only studied a part of it so
          far, I am particularly thrilled with this comment in her report:</p>
      <p><i>&#147;This swift evolution (toward derivative products) is evidence
          that the derivatives are a natural and thriving concomitant of a free
          market in gold. Perhaps for this reason alone their presence should
          be accepted rather than eschewed. &#148; </i></p>
      <p>The document must have been written by at least two different people!
        For one thing, in the first sentence of the overview on page 14 it is
        claimed that:</p>
      <p><i>&#147;This research neither endorses nor denounces the use of derivatives
          in general.&#148; </i></p>
      <p>These contradictory comments are only a few pages apart. Where is her
        credibility? Again, I will repeat for her own benefit if she ever reads
        this, that derivatives are indeed a natural evolution in a global economy
        that has developed on top of an unstable fiat monetary experiment, blah,
        blah and blah. </p>
      <p>I really do not care what your credentials are. If you do not accept
        this argument because you are a paper bull, that is one thing, but if
        you do not accept this argument while you are supposedly representing
        the &#147;gold&#148; industry, you either don't know the first thing
        about money and credit, or you are a liar! </p>
      <p>No wonder the FAZ claims that GATA hasn't sufficiently explained the
        motives behind why anyone would even want to manipulate gold prices -
        they obviously did not read or understand the diversity of arguments
        that GATA has worked hard to present. Dr. Jessica Cross should have spent
        more time studying economics than statistics or the anecdotal consensus
        in the cab driving industry, for then she might actually be able to see
        the forest. </p>
      <p><b>What is so bad about Fiat anyhow?</b><br>
        Mr. Birnbaum, in a 1996 report<sup>4</sup> to the Joint Economic Committee,
        concludes that the derivatives business is completely unnecessary were
        there to be less volatility in the free floating fiat exchange rate system
        in the first place. He makes the case, and if he doesn't I do, that this
        volatility is also unnecessary, and only exists as a result of an unstable
        and misguided (politicized) monetary policy. Thus, the enormous growth
        in the unnecessary derivatives business (which I am sure Dr. Cross has
        a vested interest in) is a direct consequence of this unnecessary exchange
        rate volatility. </p>
      <p>A secondary result, he suggests, is that the business of the world has
        moved away from the real economy and has been dominated by asset speculation
        and general goods arbitrage. He is more right today than ever. In 1999,
        I observed this outcome on my own (captured nicely in the following chart
        by <a href="http://www.cross-currents.net/charts.htm">Alan Newman</a>)
        and dubbed the US economy a stock market economy to my clients. However,
        many bulls still insist this is all on account of the new economy!</p>
      <div align="center"><img src="images/bugos/091200_m.gif" width="320" height="240" alt="Dollar Trading Volume vs. GDP"> </div>
      <p>I'll say. Therefore, in this context, you bet that derivatives are a
        necessary evolution. That is not in question. The question is what happens
        next? Many economists have been trying to prove the growing instability
        of this monetary system, or systemic financial market risk, and anyone
        that works for the gold industry should be on the same bloody page. It
        seems that the biggest obstacle facing the gold business today, is that
        investors have forgotten what the value of gold really is. Who can blame
        them? After thirty years of spin, the facts have obviously become twisted
        and distorted, rendering the truth far, far away. End. </p>
      <p><b>A proposition for my readers</b><br>
        In conclusion, I have a big problem with the way this overly lengthy
          report was presented. The first 40 pages or so contain summary conclusions,
          while the rest of the report (160 pages) details the &#147;extensive&#148; research
          put into these conclusions. Of course, I am far too polite to suggest
          that was the order in which the report was actually written. My bet
          is that only a very small minority of passionately interested parties
          will go beyond the assertions made in the first 40 pages. Do you get
          the picture? </p>
      <p>So, here is the deal. Being one of these passionately interested parties,
        I will omit the conclusions and study the &#147;extensive&#148; research
        in the last 160 pages of the report this fall, and before the election!
        I will then write my own conclusions based on Dr. Jeckyll's analysis,
        and I will then compare my conclusions to the expert conclusions drawn
        by the esteemed &#147;Dr.&#148; I will try not to make it a lengthy treatise
        and will only publish it if I get enough email requests to do so. </p>
      <p>Thus, if you are interested in this analysis, please <a href="mailto:gold@goldenbar.com">email
          me</a> and note whether you would like the report mailed to your address
