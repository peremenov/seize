ACTIVITY</font></font></b></center>
<p style="font-family: arial;"><font size="-1">Early members of the
Serbian Chemical
Society published their professional articles on chemistry in 1898 and
1899 in
<b><font color="#000099">Nastavnik (the Teacher)</font></b>, a
journal of the Teachers' Society.&nbsp; However, already at the
beginning
of 1899 the Society published a separate Bulletin under the name o<font
 color="#000000">f
</font><b><font color="#000099">Minutes
of the Serbian Chemical Society. </font></b>From 1899 to 1906, 11
issues
of the Minutes were published.&nbsp; In 1906 publication of the Minutes
ceased.&nbsp; In 1914 a report by M. Stojiljkovic for the period
1904-1906
was published in the Teacher.&nbsp; Those were the first publishing
activities
of the Serbian Chemical Society.</font>
<br>
<font size="-1">In the Statute of the Society which
was passed in January 1927, several articles referred to the
professional
journal.&nbsp; In article 5 dealing with the means of realizing the
tasks
of the Society, it was said that this would be achieved, among other
things,
<font color="#000099">"by
publishing a professional journal"</font>. Three more articles of the
Statute
referred to publishing magazines; article 34: "The Administrative
Committee
is to organize the publication of a professional journal as a
periodical
of the Society," article 35: "The Society will issue separate
regulations
about editorial work and publication of the journal," article 36: "The
professional journal will be printed at a location which the
Administrative
Committee finds most suitable for the interests of the Society. All
members
of the Editorial Board need not necessarily be from the town where the
journal is published, for they can communicate in written form." The
journal
of the Serbian Chemical Society was founded three years after the
Statute
had been passed.</font>
<br>
<font size="-1">However, already in the same year
when, after the First World War, the restored Serbian Chemical Society
started working, i.e. in 1927, several chemical papers were published.
The first two years, 1927 and 1928, the papers were published in a
journal
both for chemistry and pharmacy: <b><font color="#000099">The Archives
for Entire Chemistry and Pharmacy</font></b> which was published as a
supplement
to <b><font color="#000099">Glas apotekarstva (the Voice of Pharmacy)</font></b>,
the journal of the Serbian Pharmaceutics Society.&nbsp; The Journal was
edited by A. Leko, P. Jovanovic and M. Mokranjac, as well as by the
former
Editor of the Voice of Pharmacy M. Mirkovic. The first year three
issues
were published and in the following year, 1928, one issue.&nbsp; In
1929
the Journal separated from the Voice of Pharmacy and was published
independently
under the name of <b><font color="#000099">Anali hemije i farmacije
(Annals
of Chemistry and Pharmacy)</font></b>.&nbsp; Only one issue was
published
because in<b><font color="#000099"> 1930</font></b> the Chemical
Society
of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes started its own scientific
and professional publication <b><font color="#000099">Glasnik
Hemijskog
Drustva Kraljevine Jugoslavije (The Journal of the Chemical Society of
the Kingdom of Yugoslavia). </font></b>Nikola Pusin was entrusted with
the editorial work. He was Editor-in-Chief of the Journal till the
beginning
of the Second World War.&nbsp; The first editorial board was elected on
March 25th, 1930.</font>
<br>
<font size="-1">The last pre-war volume of the
Journal, volume 10 in 1939, contained 15 papers, 3 reports, 4
communications
and 1 obituary on 219 pages. The last paper was received in
mid-December,
1940 which means that the last issue of that year was published either
at the end of 1940 or, which is more probable, at the beginning of 1941.</font>
<br>
<font size="-1">The first post-war volume of the
Journal was published in 1947 under the name<b><font color="#000099">
Glasnik
hemijskog drustva Beograd (Journal of the Chemical Society of Belgrade).</font></b>
That year, two volumes were published: volume 11, designated 1940-1946,
and volume 12 for 1947.&nbsp; The Editorial Board for publication of
the
Journal was named at the end of 1945, and constituted at the beginning
of 1946.&nbsp; Nikola A. Pusin remained on as Editor-in-Chief.</font>
<br>
<font size="-1">At the beginning of 1957 the Administrative
Committee of the Society decided that from <font color="#000099">January,
1957</font> papers could be published in<font color="#000099"> English,
German, Russian and French</font>, with a short summary in the national
language.&nbsp; The first paper written in English was published in the
triple issue 5-6-7.&nbsp; It was the paper by Velimir Canic and Radmila
Djordjevic, accepted on May 11th, 1957: The Basicities of
Pyridine-Monocarboxyllc
Acid Ethyl Esters and the Equilibrium Between Dipolar Ions and
Uncharged
Molecule in Solutions of These Acids.</font>
<br>
<font size="-1">From 1957 the Journal has the title
<b><font color="#000099">Documenta
Chemica Jugoslavica</font></b> at the top of its covers. This was the
outcome
of long-term efforts of the Union of Chemical Societies of Yugoslavia
to
achieve some definite uniformity in publishing journals and in
promoting
the scientific level papers published in Yugoslav chemical periodicals.
Only journals that agreed to respect an agreement about a number of
technical
question mostly, that papers could only be published after having been
given at lea two positive reviews, were allowed to have this title.</font>
<br>
<font size="-1">After 1957, that is, after volume
22 had been published, the Journal due to the shortage of financial
means,
was not published for almost three years.&nbsp; By the beginning of
1961
one special issue of the Journal had been published. That issue
contained
the author, subject and formula, indexes of volumes 1-10 (1930-1939),
published
in 1958, and 6 issues of volumes 23-24 for 1958159.&nbsp; At the
beginning
of 1961 some means were obtained from the <font color="#000099">Fund
for
Publishing Activities</font> and the <font color="#000099">Council for
Culture of Serbia</font>. Some means were also obtained from
institutions
whose members published their papers in the Journal. In order to
regulate
the financial situation of the Journal, the Administrative Committee
decided
to introduce advertisements in the Journal so that some money could be
collected in that way. The publishing house "Nolit" in 1961 agreed to
publish
parallel editions of the Journal in English with the assistance of <font
 color="#000099">International
Technical Funds.</font>&nbsp; The number of printed copies in 1961 was
1280, of which 70 copies were exchanged for foreign journals from 24
countries
and 15 with domestic publishers.</font>
<br>
<font size="-1">In 1963, due to the publication
of the delayed issues of volume 27 for 1962, only issues 1 and 2 of
volume
28 for 1963 were published; other issues were published in 1964. As the
delay in the publication of the Journal was longer and longer, the
Administrative
Committee of the Society was forced to change publishers. Volume 28 had
59 papers. The Editors continued to encourage members of the Society to
more frequently send their papers to the Journal, because the
publication
of all 10 issues "depended exclusively on their scientific activity."</font>
<br>
<font size="-1">The appeal to authors for their
intensive co-operation failed, and in 1964 the number of papers was
reduced
to 36. Consequently, the triple issue 8-9-10 contained only abstracts
of
the 11th Annual Meeting.&nbsp; During that year Djordje M. Dimitrijevic
was appointed new Editor.&nbsp; The new Editorial Board issued new
extended
rules on how to prepare manuscripts for publication. In 1965 the number
of papers decreased again - 33 papers on 337 pages. Beside 10 issues,
volume
30 also had a separate supplement containing the <font color="#000099">Proposal
of the Yugoslav Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry Made on the Basis
of
the Recommendations of the International Union for Pure and Applied
Chemistry</font>.&nbsp;
The Serbian version of the proposal was done by Prof. Vukic Micovi.</font>
<br>
<font size="-1">In 1968 Aleksandar R. Despic was
elected Editor-in-Chief.&nbsp; In the triple issue 2-3-4 bibliographic
cards appeared for the first time They contained summaries of published
papers and universal decimal classification; these cards were published
regularly till 1978.&nbsp; The total of published papers was 45 in
three
triple issues (2-3-4, 5-6-7, 8-5-10).</font>
<br>
<font size="-1">In 1972, apart from 5 double issues
with 36 papers, the jubilee issue of the Journal was published on
occasion
of the 75th anniversary of the Society.&nbsp; In that issue Prof.&nbsp;
Djordje Dimitrijevic, President of the Society, gave a detailed review
of the history of the Society, which included both the foundation of
the
Journal and its activities in former years. The Editor of the jubilee
volume
was Prof.&nbsp; Dragomir Vitorovic.</font>
<br>
<font size="-1">In 1976 Prof. Slobodan V. Ribnikar
was named Editor-in-Chief. The same year the Journal came out in a new
more modem outfit, and the authors were given new instructions on to
how
to prepare their text.&nbsp; The number of papers was suddenly
increased,
which, to some extent, was a consequence of the more regular
publication
of the Journal.&nbsp; The Journal was introduced into international
classification
according to which it was given the label <b><font color="#000099">YU-ISSN
0017-0941</font></b>.&nbsp; The Journal had 589 subscribers in
Yugoslavia
and 38 abroad, and 134 copies were sent abroad to be exchanged.</font>
<br>
<font size="-1">In<font color="#000099"> June 1984</font>
at the Annual Assembly of the Serbian Chemical Society, it was decided,
beginning from volume 50 for 1985, to have all papers published <font
 color="#000099">only
in English</font>, and to have the title of the Journal changed to the
<b><font color="#000099"><a href="JSCS-home.htm">Journal
of the Serbian Chemical Society</a></font></b>.&nbsp; The summaries
would
continue being written in Serbian.</font>
<br>
<font size="-1">In 1985 the Journal was published
exclusively in English, 12 issues a year, under the new name and with a
different cover (designer Milan Jovanovic).&nbsp; Eighty-three papers
were
printed on 582 pages.&nbsp; Two more associates were included in
editing
the Journal,
<font color="#000099">Prof. Milica Misic-Vukovic and Prof.
Svetozar Niketic</font>, as Assistants to the Editor-in-Chief
Academician
<font color="#000099">Dragutin
M. Drazic</font> was appointed Editor-in-Chief In 1986 he took over all
editorial work together with the former Assistant Editors, Editorial
Board
and Council.</font>
<br>
<font size="-1">The Journal attained the largest
scope in the course of 1995 on the 10th anniversary of being published
under its new name and in English when 142 papers by 322 authors (25
foreign)
were published on 1201 pages. At the request of the <font
 color="#000099">Institute
for Scientific Information - SCI from Philadelphia (USA)</font> a
contract
was made for the Journal to be included in their Genuine Articles
