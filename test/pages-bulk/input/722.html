a slightly exasperated Professor Stephen        Chaffee admits, when asked to summarize the Internet's        impact on society. &quot;There is a lot of speculation,        tons of books and predictions, but when you look at the        evidence, it's very sketchy.&quot; </font></p>        <p><font size="3" face="times">Not surprisingly then,        Chaffee, a Stanford professor of communication who has        been tracking the influence of television on politics        over 35 years and is starting to pick up signs of        Internet influence, was delighted to learn recently that        an esteemed social scientist, business executive and        well-placed high-tech entrepreneur was coming to campus        for the purpose of tracking &quot;what's going on.&quot;        He is Norman Nie, former chair of the University of        Chicago's political science department, longtime study        director of that university's National Opinion Research        Center, and co-founder and former chief executive of        SPSS, one of the world's leading software companies. Nie        has traded in those roles to direct a new research        institute, the Stanford Institute for the Quantitative        Study of Society (SIQSS). Its central mission is to apply        survey research data to the analysis of broad social        changes, especially those prompted by information        technology and educational attainment. </font></p>        <p><font size="3" face="times">&quot;Norman is sincere,        and he knows how to do this,&quot; Chaffee says. </font></p>        <p><font size="3" face="times">&quot;Norman is a very        energetic research entrepreneur,&quot; adds economics        Professor Emeritus Victor Fuchs, &quot;and that's good        because the question of how technology is changing our        society is a fascinating one. He is also interested in        the role of education, and if you think about it from one        point of view, education and information technology are        not that far apart. We often confuse the education        process with its product, and we may be doing the same        with this new technology.&quot; </font></p>        <p><font size="3" face="times">Computer-based information        technology might turn out to be as influential as        Gutenberg's press, which is said to have necessitated the        creation of nation states and modern warfare, says        Chaffee. But it's also possible its influence will be        more modest, such as that of the telegraph, which, along        with railroads, brought us &quot;a country 3,000 miles        wide that functions as a single unit,&quot; he says.        &quot;All we know is that every time there has been        widespread adoption of a new communication technology        there have been lots of consequences and that adoption of        this latest one is coming on really fast.&quot; </font></p>        <p><font size="3" face="times">So fast that Nie worries        the country is missing the boat -- failing to collect        baseline data on social trends that are the subject of        widespread speculation. Who hasn't had a conversation        lately about how technology is changing jobs, family        life, community, commerce or politics? </font></p>        <p><font size="3" face="times">&quot;There is currently        no study going on that is capable of tracking the social,        economic and political consequences of [information        technology] outside the workplace,&quot; Nie said        recently between bites of leftover cheese and crackers, a        make-do lunch on a day crammed with appointments.        &quot;There just hasn't been the right combination of        fundraising, scholarship and focus. That's what I've come        here to do, and to get if off the ground as quickly as        possible.&quot; </font></p>        <p><font size="3" face="times">For Nie, Stanford was a        logical location once he resigned his other posts. He's        an admirer of President Gerhard Casper, who was his        provost at Chicago; his intellectual friendships here        date back to his graduate student days in the late 1960s;        the campus is closer to his home in Sun Valley, Idaho,        than was Chicago; and his Encina Commons office is, of        course, in the heart of the Silicon Valley, information        technology's home base. &quot;I think it's just        fascinating that with all the money generated by the IT        industry and all their belief, if you listen to their        advertising, that they are revolutionizing work and        social life, that there have been so few, if any, quality        studies of these phenomena funded by the high-tech        industry,&quot; he says. </font></p>        <p><font size="3" face="times">The industry often paints        a glowing portrait of information technology, calling the        Internet in particular a tool for greater democracy,        freedom, social connectivity and financial opportunity.        Perhaps the industry doesn't want studies that might find        some holes in that picture, a reporter suggests to Nie,        who immediately shakes his head. </font></p>        <p><font size="3" face="times">&quot;The gentlemen who        sit out on Sand Hill Road and the founders of the        companies they sponsor very much should want to know the        social impact of what they are doing,&quot; he says.        Besides, he points out, bad research projects will be        done on a shoestring and, in the absence of quality        studies, will unduly influence public opinion. </font></p>        <p><font size="3" face="times">Take, for example, the        study on the &quot;Internet blues&quot; that made        front-page headlines in late August. Nie grimaces at the        mere mention of that study's primary finding: Too much        Internet surfing makes people depressed. </font></p>        <p><font size="3" face="times">&quot;Here's a study that        starts with a group of people, follows them for a few        months, measures their use of the Internet and their        level of depression, and shows that as their Internet use        increases their depression increases, and they conclude        that the causal arrow goes from Internet usage to        depression. Now, would you be surprised to know that        depressed people also watch more television than        non-depressed people? I'd simply say it was interesting,        but it doesn't tell you the causal direction.&quot; </font></p>        <p><font size="3" face="times">Quality studies are being        conducted on the effects of computers in the workplace        and on firms, Nie says. &quot;What is missing is a        systematic approach to how information technology affects        the boundaries between work and family life, how it        affects the very concept of collegiality and informal        face-to-face relations. One of the ways to view this        technology is as a wonderful communications and consumer        tool. Another way is to look at it as the latest step in        the long chain of the crisis of modernity, which is a        series of technological changes that remove people        further and further from the supporting ligatures and        interpersonal communities of first the village and        neighborhood, the extended family, then the nuclear        family, and now the broken nuclear family.&quot; </font></p>        <p><font size="3" face="times">Nie's interest in these        subjects dates back to his undergraduate days at George        Washington University in St. Louis, where he was the        &quot;favorite&quot; student of Ken Prewitt, today's U.S.        Census director, recalls Gabriel Almond, Stanford        professor emeritus of political science. Prewitt        recommended him to Stanford for graduate work, where Nie        turned out to be &quot;statistically extremely        sophisticated and with an early ambition to specialize in        quantitative research,&quot; Almond says. </font></p>        <p><font size="3" face="times">&quot;I was one of Sid        Verba's research assistants here at Stanford,&quot; Nie        reminisces, &quot;and we were working on citizen        participation. We had this flood of data coming in from        hour-and-a-half-long interviews from eight countries of        every continent. . . . I knew that the then-current        tabulation equipment -- counter sorters and plugboard        machines -- were simply not up to it.&quot; </font></p>        <p><font size="3" face="times">So Nie built a        &quot;boxcar inside a shoebox,&quot; writing computer        code for a 7090 mainframe of the mid-1960s that permitted        the researchers to manipulate their data with        sophisticated statistical techniques. Today, the        follow-on development of that code is the leading        research tool for university social scientists as well as        marketing and polling organizations. But as a student in        1968 and for years afterward, Nie says, &quot;I had no        idea that it would be commercially viable. Timing in life        is a lot of the story.&quot; </font></p>        <p><font size="3" face="times">If Nie has his way, the        Stanford Institute for the Quantitative Study of Society        will draw researchers from across campus who will turn        those tools loose on new data. He wants them to have        access to systematic surveys of random, representative        cross-sections of Americans in order to see emerging        patterns. Raising the financial resources for ongoing        surveys is one of his paramount tasks as director.        Besides Fuchs and Chaffee, other faculty who have become        involved in the institute include political scientists        David Brady, Doug Rivers, David Epstein and Shanto        Iyengar, and visiting professor Sharyn O'Halloran. </font></p>        <p><font size="3" face="times">&quot;We are funding small        projects by individual faculty members with grants of        $5,000,&quot; Nie says, adding that he soon will announce        a program of $25,000 grants for larger studies of social        change. &quot;There are no good one-man-band        institutes,&quot; he says, explaining why the institute        is also hosting faculty seminars and a public lecture        series. </font></p>        <p><font size="3" face="times">Nie also wants to study        the impact of formal schooling on society. He is among a        growing number of social scientists who question the        reigning paradigm about the ever-increasing returns to        education. Education, or more specifically, years of        schooling, has proved to be the best predictor social        scientists have been able to isolate for success in life.        </font></p>        <p><font size="3" face="times">&quot;If you read the        literature in all the social science disciplines on        education -- education and citizenship, education and        earnings, education and belonging -- you see arguments        for a predominantly human capital model of education's        role: the more education, the better,&quot; he says. </font></p>        <p><font size="3" face="times">But you also will see that        as authors work with later 20th century data in        industrialized countries, they increasingly make        arguments for exceptions to maintain the premise.        &quot;They will say, 'Well, income would have continued        to go up except for this,' or 'Citizen engagement would        have gone up except for the contravening forces of        television or the death of political parties.' I think we        have rushed far too far with this notion that education        produces better citizenship, more income for everybody, a        better occupational structure, more organizational        engagement. Its effects seem to vary from outcome to        outcome enormously.&quot; </font></p>        <p><font size="3" face="times">Take the conventional        wisdom that a college degree leads to community influence        and political participation, a subject that Nie and two        co-authors addressed in their prize-winning 1996 book, <i>Education        and Democratic Citizenship in America.</i> </font></p>        <p><font size="3" face="times">&quot;If it took a B.A.        degree 25 years ago to get you in the front seat of the        town meeting through your occupational profile or your        position in the community and your inevitable leadership        in organizational networks, what does it take        today?&quot; Nie asks. &quot;Certainly, a B.A. puts you        nowhere near the front of the ongoing town meeting, and        that says to me that power and influence is not easily        expandable. It may take long periods of time and great        social invention to expand them. I mean, you can multiply        by 1,000 the number of messages that citizens send to        their government, but you can't multiply by anything like        1,000 the number of messages that the government can        respond to.&quot; </font></p>        <p><font size="3" face="times">There are also        &quot;anomalies in the system&quot; that purports to        tells the economic story, he says. &quot;We rank last        among industrialized societies in terms of the        quantitative knowledge we produce in our college and high        school graduates, for example, but the Silicon Valley is        not in Germany; it's right here.&quot; One possibility,        Nie says, it that the late Harvard economist Fred Hirsch        was right when he observed that &quot;more education for        everybody leaves everybody in the same place.&quot;        Sometimes education is more of a &quot;sorting        machine&quot; than a creator of human capital, he says,        but to figure out when education is most worthwhile        requires data that the census and other national        databases don't gather, such as where Americans went to        school and what they majored in. </font></p>        <p><font size="3" face="times">Not everyone involved in        the institute has the same concerns as Nie, he and others        say, but they see value in the joint enterprise.        &quot;The social sciences have taken the road to        balkanization about as far as it can go,&quot; Nie says.        &quot;I count every day when I go into one of these        seminars or meetings how many disciplines we've managed        to bring out.&quot; </font></p>        <p><font size="3" face="times">Whatever the outcome of        these long-range studies, it's evident that Stanford is        the right place for Nie, since his life is inextricably        linked both to education and the study of information        technology. Caught in Palo Alto pre-lunch traffic on the        day he was interviewed for this story, he used his cell        phone several times to escape the consequences of missed        appointments, and he synced his personal digital        assistant with his computer so he could continue to        conduct institute business from a remote location -- a        hospital, where he planned to welcome his first        grandchild in person. &quot;You can do an awful lot of        things on the net,&quot; he explained, between sips of        Diet Coke, &quot;but you can't look someone in the eye,        you can't shake their hand and you certainly can't give        them a hug and a kiss.&quot; SR <br>        </font></p>        <p><font size="3" face="times"><br>        </font></p>        <p><font size="3" face="times"><!--webbot bot="ImageMap"        startspan        rectangle=" (288,2) (337, 68)  ../../features/features.html"        rectangle=" (228,4) (284, 68)  ../../classifieds/classifieds.html"        rectangle=" (175,0) (229, 68)  ../../events/events.html"        rectangle=" (129,1) (179, 68)  ../../opinion/opinion.html"        rectangle=" (73,0) (124, 65)  ../../people/people.html"        rectangle=" (10,3) (72, 68)  ../news.html"        src="../../gifs/navwh.gif" border="0" width="354"        height="69" --><MAP NAME="FrontPageMap2"><AREA SHAPE="RECT" COORDS="288, 2, 337, 68" HREF="../../features/features.html"><AREA SHAPE="RECT" COORDS="228, 4, 284, 68" HREF="../../classifieds/classifieds.html"><AREA SHAPE="RECT" COORDS="175, 0, 229, 68" HREF="../../events/events.html"><AREA SHAPE="RECT" COORDS="129, 1, 179, 68" HREF="../../opinion/opinion.html"><AREA SHAPE="RECT" COORDS="73, 0, 124, 65" HREF="../../people/people.html"><AREA SHAPE="RECT" COORDS="10, 3, 72, 68" HREF="../news.html"></MAP><img src="../../gifs/navwh.gif" border="0" width="354" height="69" usemap="#FrontPageMap2"><!--webbot bot="ImageMap"        i-checksum="54523" endspan --> </font></p>        </td>    </tr></table></div><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
