<span class="title">Thoughts on Medical School Interviews II</span>

<br><br>

<p><strong>by Scott Parazynski BS '83 Stanford University</strong>

<p class="indent">
<em>Here are some thoughts on interviewing from my experience as an interviewee, 
Advising Associate, Residence Assistant, Freshman Premed Advisor, UAC Premed Advisor, 
and a member of Stanford Medical School's Committee on Admissions. Be aware that each 
interview and interviewer is different and, as such, these notes should not be taken as the 
&quot;golden rule&quot;. You should speak to as many advisors, med students &amp; 
fellow applicants as soon as possible to get their insights on interviewing.</em>

<blockquote><em>
&quot;There is within medicine, somewhere beneath the pessimism and discouragement 
resulting from the disarray of the health-care system and its stupendous cost, an 
undercurrent of almost outrageous optimism about what may lie ahead for the treatment 
of human disease if we can only keep learning.&quot;</em> - Lewis Thomas, 
<u>The Medusa and the Snail</u>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>
&quot;Just what is the medical school interview?&quot;</strong>

<p class="indent">
The medical school interview (MSI) brings the applicant's numbers and essays to life and, 
with adequate preparation, can really boost an application. Though MCAT scores and GPAs 
are a mediocre index of how well a person might do in med school and decides whether an 
applicant is granted an MSI, they offer nothing to assess personality or suitability 
for a career in medicine. With decreasing importance of the MCAT at many schools and a 
strong desire by medical schools to train compassionate physicians, the MSI has a central 
role in admissions.

<p class="indent">
Being selected for a MSI is a significant achievement in itself. The admissions process 
essentially involves reducing a large applicant pool to a relatively small number of 
competitive applicants. The MSI is an imperfect means of selecting the best potential 
MDs from among this group. Basically, the MSI is designed to substantiate your application 
by subjectively evaluating your compatibility with the school and motivations for pursuing 
an MD. Also, time is allowed for a question/answer period about the school itself. 
This is quite a difficult task in an interview that lasts only 20 minutes!

<p><strong>
&quot;Is there any way to prepare for the 3rd degree?&quot;</strong>

<p class="indent">
Time spent in preparation for the MSI is time well-spent. The admissions panel will place 
a great deal of importance on your interview report, and confidence going into the MSI 
is essential. You don't need to spend hours preparing answers to &quot;standard&quot; MSI 
questions, but you should review the most commonly asked interview questions.

<p class="indent">
Unfortunately, MSI questions can come in an infinite number of forms. The solution: 
&quot;study&quot; the basics. Although there are no standard MSI questions, certain 
general topics invariably come up: your college, work and extracurricular experiences; 
your motivation for becoming a physician; and your &quot;uniqueness&quot;. Read and 
re-read your AMCAS Personal Statement and other essays. Be prepared to talk in further 
detail about anything mentioned in your application. Go back and study your notes and 
any publications you might have from research projects; re-read your best history paper, 
the article you wrote for <i>The Daily,</i> etc. 

<p class="indent">
Think back on your various extracurricular 
pursuits. What did they mean to you and how did they influence your motivation to become 
a physician? Really think about why you want to go to medical school. What do you hope 
to accomplish and contribute to medicine? How do you know what being an MD is like? 
Think about your strengths and weaknesses, likes and dislikes. If you're a junior 
researcher, why aren't you pursuing just a Ph.D.? Where is your research going and 
what would you do next? Be aware of any new developments in your application which you 
may want to bring up at the MSI: any recent awards or achievements? You might mention 
other activities unrelated to medicine: current volunteer tutoring, athletic participation, 
a musical performance or an interesting trip for spring break is worth discussing and 
could liven a stalled MSI.  These are just guidelines to &quot;organize&quot; your brain;  
the best preparation is to know yourself and to have solid reasons for seeking an MD.

<p class="indent">
The admissions panel will certainly want to know why you're applying to their school. 
Therefore, research the school thoroughly before going for your MSI. Read the school's 
catalog and review the Stanford &quot;red Books&quot; (surveys of Stanford graduates 
attending med schools). Use this information wisely during the question/answer period 
of your MSI. Construct insightful questions about the medical school program. Well 
thought-out questions demonstrate that you have researched their program and are 
enthusiastic about the school. Don't ask about their grading system or vacation schedule; 
this is blatantly obvious in their catalog. <em>&quot;What are the opportunities for early 
clinical experiences during my freshman year?&quot; &quot;Is it possible to obtain teaching 
experience during the basic sciences curriculum?&quot;</em> are examples of appropriate questions.

<p class="indent">
In addition, a general knowledge of trends in medicine and the goings-on in the world make 
for interesting conversation. Topics such as in-vitro fertilization, abortion, euthanasia, 
socialized medicine, the AIDS epidemic and the high costs of medicine are often brought up 
as an exercise in current awareness and logical thought. When discussing such topics, substantiate 
what you believe with what you know. Try not to get defensive. There are no right or wrong 
answers. Think about how you would try to address the issues.

<p class="indent">
Take notes on your MSI &quot;performances&quot;: what went well, what went wrong? 
This strategy will help you improve subsequent MSI performance. You should also plan to 
re-read your entire application to a school the night before your MSI, just to refresh 
your memory. To come across well at the MSI, you need to express yourself well: be concise 
and articulate. Learning to relax with difficult questions is important in handling the 
stress of an MSI.

<p class="indent">
As a final preparation before your interview, schedule a mock interview at the UAC - 
this is a great opportunity for <em>immediate</em> feedback! All of this preparation will build 
your confidence and help you to present yourself succinctly <em>regardless of the 
questions asked.</em>

<p><strong>
&quot;What's going to happen to me?&quot;</strong>

<p class="indent">
Nightmares abound regarding stressful interviews and you've likely heard the rumors. 
From my experience and common consensus, pressure-type interviews are far less common than 
the &quot;laid-back, Californian&quot; variety. Granted, the MSI is an anxiety-ridden 
experience and some form of self-imposed stress reaction is normal. Fortunately, 
the process gets much easier with experience and, by your 3rd or 4th MSI, you may find 
yourself more relaxed than your interviewer! Remember that most interviewers are 
volunteers for the job and as such: a) usually enjoy meeting people and interviewing; 
b) were all once in your shoes; and c) don't bite (usually).

<p class="indent">
In the unfortunate event that you run into someone who asks you to open a nailed-shut 
office window, keep your composure and play along with it. If dealing with the former, 
stick with your answer and substantiate it. If a question seems vague or offensive, 
don't immediately jump in without thinking. Try to clarify what's being asked and to 
pin the interviewer down to a specific question. If this doesn't work, punt: 
<em>&quot;Well, that's a very interesting question. I'd have to think about 
that for a while.&quot;</em>

<p class="indent">
Interview formats vary from school to school. Prior to your interview trip, talk with 
medical students, your advisors and friends who have interviewed at the school to get details. 
On the average, you will receive 2 one-on-one interviews, often one with a faculty member 
and one with a medical student. Other varieties do exist with multiple interviewers or 
multiple interviewees. Interviews may be &quot;blind&quot;, where the interviewer has not 
yet read your file, or they may be based on a thorough review. There are advantages and 
disadvantages to each. In a blind interview you may not have to explain your 
C- in Weed Out Chemistry 101, but you're more likely to have to tell your complete life 
story to a stranger. In a reviewed MSI, often the interviewer has been selected for you 
based on common academic interests (a molecular biologist for an undergrad biochemistry 
researcher, for example). This underscores the need for complete honesty and avoidance 
of exaggeration. The interviewer probably knows more about your specialty than you, and 
half truths really stand out.

<p class="indent">
Another point about MSIs is that they often don't take the full scheduled time allotment 
(generally 1 hour). MSIs can be as short as 20 minutes to longer than 2 hours. Note: 
the length of an interview is not a reliable indicator of how well or how poorly an MSI went: 
it's the content that matters.

<p><strong>
&quot;Who are they looking for?&quot;</strong>

<p class="indent">
The MSI is designed to fill the gaps in your personal statement: are you charismatic, 
enthusiastic, friendly and warm? The MSI also serves to assess communication skills: 
do you have fluid and articulate speech? Medical schools are also looking for people 
who are oriented to the school's strong programs: a researcher-type might have a tougher 
time gaining acceptance to a school that primarily trains Family Practitioners and vice versa.

<p class="indent">
Interviewers like to see an applicant who follows what's going on in the world, not 
someone buried completely under books. They want students with a well-founded desire to 
practice medicine and students enthusiastic about their school. They will probe your 
involvement in extracurricular activities and research, and expect thorough knowledge. 
You should stress the <em>independent work and creativity</em> that went into your projects. What 
thought process, critical decisions and judgment went into your experimentation? No one 
wants to hear the details of how to pour an agarose gel.

<p class="indent">
Express <em>your</em> thoughts, not what you think the interviewer wants to hear. 
Also realize that your interviewer will ask you two basic types of questions: those that 
you're expected to know and those that are geared to test your comprehension and analytical 
abilities. You aren't expected to know everything, so don't be afraid to say, &quot;I 
don't know&quot;. It's often looked upon very favorably when a student has the courage 
to admit this. Don't bluff or give a hand-waving explanation this is easy to spot. Finally, 
you may be asked how you rank their school: be honest. If it's your number one choice, 
by all means tell them. If not, state enthusiastically that you are strongly considering 
them (otherwise you'd be wasting your time and money), but that you haven't finished 
visiting/interviewing at all schools yet.

<p class="indent">
<em>(About controversial issues: these can be a problem for female applicants. 
Topics like pregnancy, raising children, marriage, etc. are taboo, but might be asked. 
Keep your cool and answer honestly. Unfortunately, if you want to get into that school, 
you'll have to be cautious about protesting. But, if the MSI went badly, you can defend 
yourself in a letter to the Director of Admissions stating what was unfair. This tactic might 
go in your favor and you could get another MSI.)</em>

<p><strong>
&quot;Emily Post's MSI Etiquette&quot;</strong>

<p class="indent">
Honesty, humility, enthusiasm and humor (within reason; play it by ear) are your best 
bets for a successful interview. 

<p class="indent">
Remember not to sell yourself short - go into the MSI 
believing you're a very special person who could &quot;do their school proud&quot;. 
If you don't toot your horn, no one else will. Just do it in moderation. You need to walk 
the fine line between humility and conceit to get your best attributes across to your interviewer. 
Conversely, be aware of your weak points as these may also come up in the discussion. 
I realize that Stanford students have few weaknesses, but it's important to have identified 
a few beforehand. Typical responses like &quot;I tend to get involved in too many activities, 
but I never let my performance be compromised&quot; are overused. You can do better - just add 
a positive note. 

<p class="indent">
Relax and, if possible, enjoy your interview. Interviewers are genuinely 
interested in meeting and making next year's class a strong one, so generalized terror 
probably isn't warranted. Try to express a confident and positive attitude. 

<p class="indent">
If you are shy, it may take longer than the allotted time to get things rolling. 
Monosyllabic responses and lack of enthusiasm are not exciting conversation. This 
perception may carry over to your evaluation. Practice making strong first impressions 
when meeting people. Schedule a mock interview at UAC to reinforce this. You need 
to come across as a warm and sensitive person with excellent potential.

<p class="indent">
A word of caution: try not to monopolize the interview or get too verbose. This leaves 
a very negative impression. If an interviewer gets on a tangent and you feel that you 
haven't quite touched on all the major bases it's OK to tactfully and cautiously guide 
the interview in a more productive direction. As for physical appearance, applicants 
stick out in their pressed blue blazers and conservative dresses among the faded jeans 
and unshaven faces of the local med students (and even their interviewers on occasion). 
Nonetheless, professional and conservative dress is strongly recommended, as it is a token 
of respect and reflects a serious attitude. You might argue that you have a right to 
&quot;express yourself&quot; through your clothing, but why risk it? You should dress 
so that the interviewer won't think about your attire but about you. This translates 
to a 3-piece suit or jacket and tie for men, a business-type dress for women.

<p class="indent">
You should think about your body language and how this may affect your interviewer. 
Specifically, try not to fidget or tap your feet. Nervousness is normal; try to quell 
this with an occasional deep breath. Don't stare outside or at the clock. Express interest 
in what both of you are saying by leaning slightly forward and keeping eye contact with your 
interviewer.

<p class="indent">
One last word of advice on MSI etiquette: don't take the medical student interview too 
lightly. Their reports carry just as much clout as a faculty MSI. Therefore, don't be 
cocky or confide something to a student that you would never say to a professor. Remember 
that student and faculty are working together and you might get burned.

<p><strong>
&quot;Fun facts to know &amp; tell about MSI scheduling&quot;</strong>

<p class="indent">
MSI's are usually by <em>invitation only</em>. The Admissions Committee reviews your GPA, MCAT scores, 
personal statement, secondary application and letters of recommendation, and then somehow 
decides whom to interview (See Ruby and Nancy on how to go about getting one). The 
percentage of applicants interviewed depends on the particular school - often only a small 
fraction are granted an MSI. Once you've been granted an interview, pat yourself on the 
back and/or congratulate yourself in some fashion. You've made the big cut and are one of a 
few highly competitive applicants being considered. Often a school will assign you a 
date and time that may be difficult to accommodate, especially if on the east coast. 
Generally, the Admissions Staff is flexible and will arrange another date as need be.

<p class="indent">
If you haven't heard from a school but will be &quot;in the neighborhood&quot; on the 
opposite coast, it is acceptable to call or write a school well in advance of your trip 
to request an MSI. Give the school at least 3-4 weeks leeway, the dates of your trip and 
a polite letter. It's OK to call if you haven't gotten a response in a couple of weeks. It 
isn't OK, however, to walk up to their doorstep and request an interview on the spot.

<p class="indent">
This is a serious MSI <em>faux pas.</em> If you have been rejected from a school but 
think your application is competitive (be realistic), you may appeal the decision and 
ask for a review of your record. After all, you have nothing to lose and at best will 
get an interview.

<p class="indent">
Some schools will offer a regional MSI; there is no known disadvantage with respect to 
admission by opting for a regional. Some say that having a local MSI may show a greater 
interest in a school, but committees are cognizant of financial constraints. If accepted 
and/or highly considering a school, check it out <em>first before</em> accepting a spot there.

<p class="indent">
You're probably asking, &quot;How can I afford a deluxe MSI vacation?&quot; Ticketing as 
far in advance as possible helps lower travel costs. Try to group schools regionally 
to save time and money; if you've arranged a group of 2 or more east coast schools, 
you can get special fares with unlimited travel for 21 days (try Continental and American). 
This often takes several phone calls back and forth to the admissions offices to juggle 
interview dates. 5-Star accommodations can often be arranged with a local medical student 
or in the medical school dormitory for a reasonable price (this is also a great way to meet 
the &quot;locals&quot;); call the admissions office for details.

<p class="indent">
One final thought: the interviewing &quot;season&quot; often extends until May. Generally, 
the earlier you complete your AMCAS and secondary applications, the earlier your file is 
reviewed for interview. Later in the season, the offices become backlogged and you may 
have to wait in limbo longer. Apply early!

<p><strong>
&quot;What do I get in return?&quot;</strong>

<p class="indent">
You may receive some feedback with respect to your chances for acceptance. Don't read too 
deeply into your interviewer's comments or the atmosphere of your discussion, however. Remember 
that the comment, &quot;I hope to see you here next year&quot; is only coming from one member 
of the admissions panel. Conversely, a perceived &quot;bad&quot; interview may reflect the 
interviewer's personality, and s/he may have been expressionlessly but thoroughly impressed 
by you. Moreover, one marginal MSI may be entirely negated by another excellent one. 
My advice: think positive and cross your fingers.

<p class="indent">
You will definitely have the opportunity to discover lots of information about the school 
and its environs (elicited by your insightful questions as discussed above, remember?). 
Take a tour or, if your MSI is regional, plan on seeing the school well before enrolling. 
Talk to as many students as possible and inquire about the overall quality of lectures 
and clinical education. Do senior medical students think they received a quality education? 
Also, try to assess the quality of life, the climate, your prospective peers and the 
cultural/recreational activities available.  Think about your family and friend 
support network - how would it change? Is this important? How would you, individually, 
fit into the medical school?

<p class="indent">
This will be the time to get info on financial aid, student housing, Nat'l. Board Scores 
and the Nat'l. Residency Matching Program. Visit the financial aid and housing offices, 
time permitting. Applicants tend to focus on board scores and the percentage of school's 
seniors matching their top choice for residency training. A few words of caution on each: 
some lesser schools gear their teaching toward performance on the Nat'l. Boards (rather 
than the art of medicine). As such, their students score much higher than normal. 
Remember that your patients won't have a 3 x 5 index card on their forehead with labeled 
options. As for claims like: &quot;90% of our graduating class matched their top 3 
choices&quot;, regard such statements with a certain amount of skepticism as well. 
The Residency Matching Program works with a self-selected applicant pool: a C+ student 
from Granada Medical School won't apply for training in neurosurgery at Massachusetts 
General Hospital.

<p><strong>
&quot;What happens next?&quot; i.e. <em>The Wheel of Fortune</em></strong>

<p class="indent">
Somehow all of the information at the Committee's disposal goes into a black box - the 
committee meeting - and emerges as accepted, wait list and rejected candidates. Often 
the decisions that are made seem arbitrary and nonsensical. I couldn't even attempt 
to describe or unravel the mysteries of the panel as they vary from school to school and 
year to year. All I can say is that a strong interview can really boost even a marginal 
applicant to an accepted spot. Give it your best shot.

<p class="indent">
A sincere follow-up thank you note to an interviewer is fine if you really enjoyed 
the conversation and if you have a strong interest in their school. Don't write if the 
MSI was only marginal, as this may appear like begging. Sit back and wait for the 
Committee's decision.
