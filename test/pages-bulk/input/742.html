<p>Project management must decide when a product is ready to
release to end users. That decision is based on a mass of
inevitably imperfect information, including an estimate of the
product's bugginess. The testing team creates that estimate. The
test manager reports it, together with an assessment of how
accurate it is. If it's not accurate enough, because not enough
testing has been done, the test manager must also report on what
the testing team is doing to obtain better information. When will
project management know enough to make a reasoned ship decision?</p>

<p>The test manager has two responsibilities: to report the <u>right</u>
information, and to report the information <u>right</u>. Both are
equally important. If you don't have the right information, you're
not doing your job. If you don't report it so that it's accepted,
valued, and acted upon, you might as well not be doing your job.</p>

<p>To address both topics, this paper is organized around the
situation in which the test manager presents &quot;the public
face&quot; of the testing team: the status meeting. It covers the
information to be presented and the needs of the people involved
(which govern how to present that information usefully).</p>

<p><font size="5" face="Arial,HELVETICA"><b>1. Context</b></font></p>

<p>We assume a product developed in two distinct phases: feature
development and product stabilization. We are specifically
concerned with status meetings during stabilization, which is
when the pressure is highest. During the stabilization phase,
developers should do nothing but fix bugs. Ideally, they do not
add or change features.</p>

<p>Testers do three types of testing during stabilization:</p>

<ol>
    <li><b>Planned testing.</b> The tester is assigned some
        functional area or property of the product (such as the
        &quot;printing subsystem&quot; or &quot;response to heavy
        network load&quot;). At the beginning of the task, he
        knows the approach to take, what a &quot;complete&quot;
        set of tests would look like, and how much time is
        allocated. (This knowledge, like anything else in the
        project, is subject to revision, but it should be roughly
        correct.)</li>
    <li><b>Guerrilla testing.</b> This is testing that
        opportunistically seeks to find severe bugs wherever they
        may be. Guerrilla testing is much less planned than the
        previous kind. The extent of planning might be: &quot;Jane,
        you're the most experienced tester, and you have a knack
        for finding bugs. From now until the end of the project,
        bash away at whatever seem to be the shakiest parts of
        the product.&quot; Guerrilla tests are usually not
        documented or preserved. See [Kaner93] for more
        information.</li>
    <li><b>Regression testing.</b> The tester reruns tests to see
        if one that used to pass now fails. If so, some change
        has broken the product.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the first part of stabilization, planned tests dominate. As
stabilization proceeds, more and more regression testing is done.
At the end of the project, the testing effort shifts entirely to
regression testing and guerrilla testing.</p>

<p>For more about the stabilization phase, see [Cusumano96] and [Kaner93].
For various software development models, see [McConnell96].</p>

<p><font size="5" face="Arial,HELVETICA"><b>2. A Note on Numbers</b></font></p>

<p>Throughout the paper, we ask you to compare actual results to
your plan. For example, we recommend that you track what
proportion of their time your team spends rerunning tests vs. how
much you expected they'd spend. A natural question is, &quot;Well,
then, what proportion <u>should</u> we expect?&quot; We're not
going to answer that question because the answers vary and, to be
useful, require project-specific context. On the other hand, we
think it's terrible that test managers have nowhere to go to get
those answers, other than to buttonhole their colleagues and swap
war stories. For that reason, we will try to collect a variety of
answers and rules of thumb from experienced test managers and put
them on the web page http://www.stlabs.com/marick/root.htm. </p>

<p><font size="5" face="Arial,HELVETICA"><b>3. Questions to
Answer in the Status Meeting</b></font></p>

<p>During the project status meeting, you should be ready to
answer certain questions, both explicit and implicit.</p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial,HELVETICA"><b><i>3.1 When will we
be ready to ship?</i></b></font></p>

<p>During stabilization, successive builds are made, found not to
be good enough, and replaced. It's a stressful time because,
early in stabilization, it often seems as if the product will <u>never</u>
be good enough. There's a lot of pressure to show forward
progress. Much attention revolves around a graph like this:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><img src="image5.gif" width="338" height="324"></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Everyone wants to know when those lines will cross, meaning
all must-fix bugs have been fixed. Part of the answer comes from
knowing how fast open bugs will be resolved. But another part of
it comes from knowing how many new must-fix bugs can be expected.
Our argument in this section is as follows:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Estimating this number is extremely difficult.</li>
    <li>If you don't do it, someone else will, probably worse
        than you would. So you should do it.</li>
    <li>Slight changes to the &quot;intuitive way&quot; of test
        planning and tracking can make the estimates better. So
        make those changes, as long as they don't get in the way
        of finding bugs.</li>
</ol>

<p>To estimate this number, the natural tendency is to do some
sort of curve-fitting (by using a ruler, a spreadsheet, or some
more sophisticated tool). If you do, your extrapolations will
likely be wildly wrong, because that curve is due to a changing
mixture of completed tasks, tasks in progress, and tasks not yet
begun, each with a different rate of finding bugs. Better than
extrapolating from the summary graph is extrapolating from each
testing task individually, using a spreadsheet like this:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><img src="image6.gif" width="379" height="104"></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Important </b></p>

<p>What's being estimated with this spreadsheet is the total
number of bugs <i>this testing effort will find before it's
finished</i>. It is not the total number of bugs in the product.
It is not the number of failures customers will see or report.
Those would be better numbers to know, but this one is
nevertheless useful.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Comparing apples and oranges</b></p>

<p>The spreadsheet above assumes that bugs will be found at
roughly the same rate throughout a task. That's unlikely. A
typical graph of cumulative bugs discovered vs. working time (which
is more meaningful than calendar time) will look like this:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="image7.gif" width="290" height="209"></p>

<p>The reason for the curve is that different activities are
lumped together in one task. Early in the task, the tester is
learning an area of the product and designing tests. While test
design does find bugs, the rate of bug discovery is lower than
when the tests are run for the first time. So, when test
execution begins, the curve turns up. As testing proceeds, an
increasing amount of time will be spent in regression testing (especially
checking bug fixes). Because rerunning a test is less likely to
find a bug than running it for the first time, the curve begins
to flatten out.</p>

<p>Your estimates will be more accurate if you track test design,
first-time execution, and regression testing separately. </p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ol>
    <li>We don't pretend that test execution doesn't have an
        element of design in it - while running tests, testers
        get ideas for new tests, which they then execute. But
        counting that &quot;embedded design&quot; as test
        execution should do no harm to what are already rough
        estimates. Major discoveries should make you schedule
        additional explicit tasks to be tracked separately.</li>
    <li>The beginning of test execution will probably find more
        bugs than the end, because it's common for testers to run
        the most promising tests first. Even if tests were run in
        random order, some bugs are obvious enough that many of
        the tests will find them. While this &quot;front-loading&quot;
        of bugs might skew your estimates, you certainly don't
        want to improve them by intentionally finding bugs later!</li>
    <li>You might find it most useful not to track retesting of
        bug fixes. Instead, simply assume that some percentage of
        fixed bugs will cause new bugs that will later be found
        by retesting. Discover the percentage not by searching
        the literature (the numbers vary widely) but by reference
        to experience with your own project or other projects in
        your company.</li>
    <li>In guerrilla testing, in which there's no formal design
        nor much rerunning of tests, the bug discovery rate
        nevertheless usually follows an S-shaped pattern, if not
        a more sawtooth pattern as the tester switches from
        opportunity to opportunity:</li>
</ol>

<p align="center"><img src="image8.gif" width="250" height="226"></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>A linear estimate early in the effort would guess high.
    That's not necessarily bad - not because it gives you more
    breathing room, but because the harm of estimating high is
    less than the harm of estimating low. You should temper the
    estimate with some judgment about when the curve is likely to
    level off.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Reality Check </b></p>

<p>You may object that this approach seems hopelessly idealistic.
Your project is chaotic enough, with code that changes so much,
and so many bugs, and so much churn in the features, and... that
there's no hope of having tasks that stay the same long enough
for extrapolations to be meaningful. If that's the case - if your
stabilization phase is anything but stable and you're really
doing mostly guerrilla testing - there's no point in presenting
wildly inaccurate estimates at the project status meeting.
Concentrate on answering the other questions presented in this
paper.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>What about unstarted tasks?</b></p>

<p>Here's a different spreadsheet, one for a project in which
configuration testing hasn't started yet:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="image9.gif" width="379" height="104"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you haven't started a task, you have no data from which to
extrapolate. But you have to, because the project manager needs
estimates in order to run the project. Here are some solutions:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Don't get into this situation. By the time the
        stabilization phase is well enough underway that this
        graph becomes the focus of attention, you should have
        made some progress on all testing tasks. That almost
        certainly means some context switching. For example, the
        tester responsible for the scenario testing task will
        have to stop part-way through and do some configuration
        testing. That's annoying, disruptive, and reduces
        efficiency - but only if you take a tester-centric view
        of the universe, one where getting testing done is the
        primary goal. Your team's primary goal is discovering
        useful information and making it available as early as
        possible. The project manager needs to know if there are
        configuration problems before the last minute. </li>
    <li>Extrapolate using numbers for testing that's already
        underway. For example, both &quot;test printing&quot; and
        &quot;test editing&quot; are functional tests of discrete
        subsystems. If the printing subsystem is half the size of
        the editing subsystem, and half as much testing is
        planned, you might reasonable predict half as many fatal
        bugs will be discovered. There are, of course, many
        variables that might confound that estimate: the
        programmer who wrote the printing code may be a much
        better programmer, the size metric you used (be it lines
        of code, number of branches, function points, programmer
        hours spent) may not capture the relative bugginess of
        the two subsystems, and so on. However, it's a better
        estimate than simply guessing, and it will improve
        rapidly as real testing begins. </li>
    <li>Extrapolate using numbers from past projects. We
        recommend that anyone doing any sort of data mining read
        up on the statistical subfield of exploratory data
        analysis. Two entertaining and influential early books
        are [Tukey77] and [Mosteller77].</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Reality check: you will certainly be wrong</b></p>

<p>Even if you are careful with your extrapolation, you should
realize that the number calculated is certainly wrong. Attaching
too much certainty to the numbers - and especially striving for
meaningless precision - will lead to madness. Concentrate on
testing, and hope that the errors in your estimates roughly
cancel each other out.</p>

<p>Ideally, you'd like to give your estimates in the form of
intervals, like this:</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="1" width="469"
bordercolor="#000000">
    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="19%"><font size="2">Week 1</font></td>
        <td valign="top" width="81%"><font size="2">&quot;We
        predict 122 to 242 bugs. Best estimate is 182.&quot;</font></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="19%"><font size="2">Week 2</font></td>
        <td valign="top" width="81%"><font size="2">&quot;We
        predict 142 to 242 bugs. Best estimate is 192.&quot;</font></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="19%"><font size="2">Week 3</font></td>
        <td valign="top" width="81%"><font size="2">&quot;We
        predict 173 to 233 bugs. Best estimate is 203.&quot;</font></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="19%"><font size="2">Week 4</font></td>
        <td valign="top" width="81%"><font size="2">&quot;We
        predict 188 to 228 bugs. Best estimate is 208.&quot;</font></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="19%"><font size="2">Week 5</font></td>
        <td valign="top" width="81%"><font size="2">&quot;We
        predict 205 to 215 bugs. Best estimate is 210.&quot;</font></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we expect your data will be unstable enough
that your calculated &quot;confidence intervals&quot; will be so
wide as to be pointless. We're also unaware of statistical
techniques that apply to this particular problem. If you wish to
explore related notions, see the large body of literature on
software reliability and software reliability growth ([Musa87][Lyu96]).
Your best bet might be using historical project data. If your
company keeps good records of past projects, and has a reasonably
consistent process, you may be able to use errors in historical
estimates to make predictions for this project.</p>

<p>We think that, rather than straining for numbers far more
exact than anything else in the project, you should concentrate
on understanding and explaining what caused any recent changes in
the estimates. Here, your goal is confidence - in you and your
team - not confidence intervals. You want to say things like:</p>

<dir>
    <li>&quot;Last week's prediction was roughly 69 more must-fix
        bugs. However, Dawn noticed some oddities as she
        continued the testing of the modules from our outsource
        partners, NightFly Technologies. She beefed up her test
        plan with some targeted use case tests. That led to last
        week's jump in bugs found, and it raised our prediction
        to roughly 95 bugs.&quot;</li>
</dir>

<p>The description behind the numbers is <i>much </i>more useful
than the numbers, because it helps the project manager make
contingency plans.</p>

<p><b>Final notes on estimation</b></p>

<ol>
    <li>Toward the end of the stabilization phase, your estimates
        will become useless. That's the point at which your team
        is concentrating on regression tests for the last few bug
        fixes, together with guerrilla testing that tries to
        squeeze out a few more must-fix bugs. This period is
        inherently unpredictable - a single lingering bug could
        take a month to fix. It's the worst part of the project.
        You will still have provided a valuable service by
        helping to predict when the hellish period starts.</li>
    <li>[DeMarco82] has useful things to say about estimation. [Bach94]
        describes a bug tracking system initially used to produce
        estimates of the sort described here. See also the
        description of Bach's work in [Keuffel94], which says,
        &quot;Bach now believes too many independent variables
        exist to make useful predictions of ship dates by simply
        leveraging off the critical-bug database.&quot; [Keuffel95]
        continues the description with some interesting
        deductions you can make from the shape of a project-wide
        graph.</li>
    <li>Make sure that the graph of found vs. fixed &quot;must
        fix&quot; bugs doesn't dominate attention to the
        exclusion of other shipping criteria. Other criteria that
        are sometimes used include trends in number of bugs found,
        active, fixed, and verified; number of lower-severity
        unfixed bugs; changes in bug severity distribution; and
        amount of recent change to the source code ([Cusumano95],
        [Kaner93], [Rothman96]). And the product shouldn't ship
        until testing is finished, including regression testing
        and a last-chance guerrilla test of the final build.</li>
</ol>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial,HELVETICA"><b><i>3.2 Which bugs
should be fixed?</i></b></font></p>

<p>A discussion of individual bugs might happen in the project
meeting or in a separate bug classification meeting. (This might
be a discussion of all bugs or, more productively, a discussion
of only controversial bugs.) You are likely to be the person who
prints and distributes the summaries and detailed listings of new
and unresolved bugs. It's preferable if the project manager leads
the meeting, not you. First, he or she has the ultimate
responsibility. Second, you will be an active participant, and it's
difficult to do a good job as both participant and meeting leader.</p>

<p>Here are some key points:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Developers have a psychological interest in assigning
        bugs a low priority or deferring them. However, you may
        well tend to over-emphasize the severity of a bug, which
        is just as harmful. The best advocates for fixing a bug
        are the people who will have to live with its
        consequences. That's not you. It's more likely to be
        customer service people and marketing people. They should
        be invited to bug classification meetings. Your role as
        advocate is to make sure that the bug report is
        understood correctly. If the bug report is being
        misinterpreted (for example, as being an unlikely special
        case instead of a symptom of a more general problem),
        correct the misinterpretation.</li>
    <li>The key issue in such a meeting is determining whether
        the risk of fixing a bug exceeds the risk of shipping it
        with the product. When helping assess risk, your job is
        to provide two bits of informed opinion:</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>What are the testing implications of fixing the bug (whether
            it's fixed alone or batched with other bugs in the
            same subsystem)? How much will adequately testing the
            fix cost? Do you have the resources to do it? Is it a
            matter of rerunning regression tests? (What's the

        <li>What's the rate of regressions? How often do bug
            fixes fail? (If the rate of regressions is high,
            especially in the subsystem in question, and that
            subsystem has light test coverage, the risk of a
            bugfix is high.)</li>

<ol>
    <li>Higher management may be tracking open bug counts. That
        can lead to unproductive pressure to make the numbers
        look good at the expense of fixing fewer but more
        important bugs. (See [Kaner93], chapter six.) As a
        responsible project member, you should be alert to
        decisions that provide only internal benefit, not benefit
        to the customer.</li>
</ol>

<p>We urge you to read the discussions of bugs and bug reporting
in [Bach94] and [Kaner93].</p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial,HELVETICA"><b><i>3.3 Where are the
danger areas in the project?</i></b></font></p>

<p>As part of the estimation process, you will become aware of
&quot;hot spots&quot; in the product: areas where there are
unusually many bugs. In the charts above, testing editing is
finding far more bugs than any other testing task. </p>

<p>The project manager is sometimes the last to know about hot
spots, since developers are incorrigibly optimistic. They tend
not to admit (to themselves) that a particular subsystem is out
of control until too late. It's your job as a test manager to
report on hot spots at the status meeting. You need to do this
with care, lest your team be viewed as the enemy by development.
Here are some tips.</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Make sure it really is a hot spot.</b></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
    <p>The heat of a hot spot is relative to the size and
    complexity of the area under test. If the editing subsystem
    is four times as complex as the printing subsystem, four
    times as many bugs is not surprising. You should have
    complexity information available, because you should have
    used it in test planning. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Historical information will help to keep hot spots in
    perspective. What's the bug rate for previous projects (per
    line of code, function point, or some other measure of size)?
    What parts of this project are out of line with the
    historical averages? </p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
    <li><b>Report on product, not people.</b></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
    <p>With perhaps a few exceptions, such as configuration
    testing, the hot spots you find will be associated with a
    particular person or team. Don't criticize them. Maybe they've
    done a shoddy job, but don't assume you have enough
    information to make that judgement. Even if you do, it's
    counterproductive at this point.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Not only must you not criticize the developers, it's
    important that they not think you're criticizing them. Your
    manner should be calm, dispassionate, and professional. Use
    &quot;we&quot; instead of &quot;you&quot;. You should take
    care to say something good along with the bad news: </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;That last overhaul of the account management
        module has really streamlined the user interface. Paul,
        the tester, says that it takes half as many mouse moves
        to get through a test as before. Of course, that means
        that users will see the same speedup. Unfortunately, his
        tests have found a big jump in the number of bugs, to the
        point where we're well above average for modules in this
        product.&quot;</p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<ul>
    <li><b>Warn of hot spots in advance.</b></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
    <p>Do not announce a hot spot without prior warning. You know
    you've damaged your usefulness when the project manager
    explodes, &quot;What do you mean, the networking subsystem is
    in crisis! Why haven't I heard about this before?!&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>One reason for no prior warning is that there's no data.
    Some testing task hadn't started until the past week. When it
    did start, the tester involved found so many bugs she had to
    down tools right away. Avoid the issue by doing at least a
    little testing on all tasks as soon as possible. You can
    defuse the issue by reporting, at each status meeting, which
    important tasks haven't started, along with a prediction of
    when each will start.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Another reason for a sudden announcement is that a testing
    task suddenly crosses the threshold where you feel you should
    raise the alarm. Avoid this by announcing which tasks you're
    watching more carefully, though they don't yet merit the
    designation &quot;hot spot&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
    <li><b>Track hot spots carefully.</b></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
    <p>The response to a hot spot should be some development
    effort (redesign or rework). When that's complete, report on
    the success: &quot;We reran all the regression tests on the
    new build, with unusually few regressions, which personally
    gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling. We've started executing
    new tests on the module, and things look good so far - many
    fewer bugs than in the last version. I think we're out of the
    woods on this one.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>An alternative to rework is to &quot;debug the code into
    working&quot;. In that case, you need to adjust your plans.
    Whereas before you scheduled a fixed amount of testing, you
    now have an open-ended testing task. You might increase the
    number of designed tests; you will certainly devote more time
    to guerrilla testing. You need to continue testing until you
    stop discovering a disproportionately large number of bugs.
    You will look for a graph like this:</p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center"><img src="image10.gif" width="263" height="204"></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>After nearly twice as much testing as planned, you seem to
    have exhausted the bugs in the code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Another type of hot spot</b></p>

<p>In addition to total bugs, track &quot;churn&quot;: how many
regression tests fail. If a disproportionately high number of bug
fixes or other changes break what used to work, there's a problem.
The subsystem is likely fragile and deserves rework or a greater
testing effort. Here's a chart that might cause alarm:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="image11.gif" width="360" height="237"></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial,HELVETICA"><b><i>3.4 Are you
working smart?</i></b></font></p>

<p>Any buggy area announced late in the project is going to be
stressful. It will likely mean some upheaval, some shifting of
development priorities. As test manager, you must also shift your
priorities, both because you now know more about risky areas and
also because you must be seen as doing more than smugly
announcing a crisis and letting someone else deal with it. It's
important to both be helpful and also be seen to be helpful.</p>

<p>Display graphs to show that the testing team is flexibly
adapting what you do to what you discover. One such graph follows.
It breaks testing down by task. It plots effectiveness (bugs
found) behind measures of effort to date. That way, mismatches
between effort and result are visually striking. The graph uses
two measures of effort: time spent and <i>coverage</i> achieved.
Code coverage measures how thoroughly tests exercise the code.
That correlates roughly with thoroughness of testing. The most
common type of code coverage measures which lines of code have
been executed. For other types of coverage, see [Kaner96] and [Marick95].
For a discussion of how coverage can be misused, see [Marick97]. </p>

<p><img src="image12.gif" width="711" height="604"> </p>

<p>Here's what you might say in the project status meeting. (Notice
that the individual testing activities tracked separately for bug
count estimation are here grouped into larger tasks.)</p>

<p>&quot;The stress tests and db tests are paying off in terms of
bugs found. The stress tests are only 14% complete, so you can
expect a lot of stress-type bugs in the next few weeks. You'll
notice that we early in the project cut back on the number of
stress tests - although we're 14% complete against plan, that's
only <i>three percent</i> of what we originally hoped to do. If
stress testing keeps finding bugs, we'll up the amount of stress
testing planned.</p>

<p>&quot;The db tests are 55% complete against plan, and they've
got 80% coverage. Given the type of testing we're doing, we might
see the bug finding rate start leveling off soon. We may not do
all the testing planned.</p>

<p>&quot;The GUI tests have been a washout. We're not finding
bugs. The code seems solid. We're stopping that testing now and
shifting the tester onto network testing, where we're finding
tons of bugs. In the network testing, you'll note that the
coverage is high in comparison to the number of tests written.
That's because we've finished the &quot;normal use tests&quot;.
The error handling tests, which we couldn't start until the
network simulator was ready, will add less coverage, but we
expect them to be a good source of bugs.</p>

<p>&quot;The calc tests were a botch. We're nearly done, without
much to show for it. My fault - I let the schedule get away from
me. We're stopping testing right away.&quot;</p>

<p><b>Comparing yourself to others</b></p>

<p>It's a common developer prejudice that testers write a lot of
tests, but it's wasted motion because they're not finding the
important bugs. First, the test manager needs to check whether
the prejudice is justified. (All too often, it is.) Second, if it's
not, reassure the project team. Doing both things starts with a
graph like this, which shows what percentage of bugs are being
found by different types of planned testing vs. those found by
chance.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="image13.gif" width="632" height="244"></p>

<p>This shows a fairly reasonable breakdown. Most new bugs are
found by the testing team: newly written feature tests,
regression tests run again, guerrilla tests, and planned
configuration tests. 10% of new bugs reported are due to
regressions, which is not outlandish. Beta customers are
reporting configuration bugs at a good clip, which is what you
expect from them. (You might want to consider doing more in-house
configuration testing if the total number of configuration bugs
is unusually high.) There are a reasonable number of bugs from
other sources (beta bugs that are not configuration problems,
bugs found by developers and other in-house use, and so on).</p>

<p>This graph is more alarming:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="image14.gif" width="634" height="248"></p>

<p>Too many bugs are being found by &quot;other&quot;, not enough
by the testing team. They're being discovered by chance. Can the
testing effort change to detect them more reliably? The fact that
guerrilla testing is doing so much better than the new feature
tests is also evidence that something's wrong with the planned
testing effort. Perhaps the problem is that the project is &quot;churning&quot;:
there are too many regressions. Maybe almost everyone on the
testing team is spending so much time running regression tests
that they have little time to execute new ones (except for a few
very productive guerrilla testers).</p>

<p>When many bugs have been found, the testing team can become a
bottleneck. Report clearly when regression testing load exceeds
the plan. Such reports, made early and forthrightly, leave the
impression that slips in the testing schedule are a result of
pitching in to help the project. Done late, you may get the blame
for the final slips, slips that happen as developers wait for you
to finish up your testing.</p>

<p>When reporting on your schedule, remind everyone that the
earliest possible ship date is the time required to complete all
planned tests, plus the time required to rerun all repeatable
tests (both manual and automated) on the final build, and time
for a series of guerrilla tests on that build.</p>

<p><font size="4" face="Arial,HELVETICA"><b><i>3.5 What does your
work mean?</i></b></font></p>

<p>We've seen how you can predict the number of bugs testing will
find and use graphs to reallocate the testing effort
appropriately. But what does all this effort mean?</p>

<p>Recall that the project manager wants to reduce uncertainty
and risk. He worries that this product will be an embarrassment
or worse after it ships. Knowing how many bugs testing will find
is useful, because it lets him predict whether the product can
ship on time, but what he <i>really</i> wants to know is how many
bugs testing <i>won't</i> find.</p>

<p>Let's assume that you graph the bugs found by <u>new</u> (not
rerun) designed tests for some particular testing task. If that
task is consistent throughout (you don't apply different testing
techniques during different parts of the task, or save the
trickiest tests for the end), you'd expect a graph that looks
something like this:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="image15.gif" width="272" height="224"></p>

<p>You'd expect something of a flurry of new bugs at first. Many
of those are the bugs that are easy to find, so that many
different tests would hit them. After those have been disposed of,
there's a more-or-less steady stream of new bugs. (In practice,
the curve might tail down more sharply, since there's a tendency
to concentrate on the most productive tests first, in order to
get bugs to the developers quickly.)</p>

<p>This graph doesn't really let you predict what happens in the
field. You can't simply extrapolate the curve. If you did a
perfect job of test design, you've tried all the bug-revealing
cases, and all bugs have been found. If your test cases are very
unrepresentative of typical customer use, you might have missed
many of the bugs customers will find, in which case there will be
a surge of new bug reports when the product is released (not
unusual).</p>

<p>So what can you do? You have to extrapolate from previous
projects.</p>

<ul>
    <li>If you discovered 70% of the configuration bugs during
        test in release 3.0, and if you continue to perform
        configuration testing roughly the same way, the safest
        bet is that you'll again miss 30% of the bugs. </li>
    <li>If you consistently apply the same set of testing
        techniques, and you size the testing effort against the
        product in a consistent way, you should hope that you'll
        find the same proportion of bugs from effort to effort.
        In practice, of course, the variability among testers
        &quot;doing the same thing&quot; is as large as it is for
        programmers (that is to say, enormous). You can reduce
        variability by having testers review each other's test
        designs, but you won't eliminate it. That's OK. Saying
        &quot;based on the past three projects, we predict
        between 50 and 120 more must-fix bugs will be found by
        customers&quot; beats only being able to say &quot;We
        tested hard, and we hope we didn't miss too much.&quot; </li>
</ul>

<p>When reporting extrapolations, don't give raw numbers. Say,
&quot;we predict the reliability of this product will be typical
[or high, or low] for this company.&quot; If possible, make
comparisons to specific products: &quot;This product did about
average on the planned tests, but remarkably few bugs were found
in guerrilla testing or regression testing. The last product with
that pattern was FuzzBuster 2.0, which did quite well in the
field. We predict the same for this one.&quot;</p>

<p>The accuracy of your predictions depends on a consistent
process. Consistent processes are the subject of industrial
quality control, especially the work of Shewhart, Deming, Juran,
and others. We in software can learn much from them, so long as
we're careful not to draw unthinking analogies. [Deming82] is
often cited, but the style is somewhat telegraphic. [Aguayo91]
has been recommended to one of us (Marick), who first learned
about statistical quality control from a draft of [Devor91]. The
Software Engineering Institute's Capability Maturity Model can be
thought of as an adaptation of modern industrial quality control
to software, though the coverage of testing is sketchy. See [Humphry89]
or [Curtis95].</p>

<p><font size="5" face="Arial,HELVETICA"><b>4. Summary of the
paper</b></font></p>

<p>As the frequent bearer of bad news, the test manager has a
difficult job. The job is easier if he or she appears competent,
knowledgeable, and proactive. It's a matter of having the
relevant information, presenting it well, being able to answer
reasonable questions. A goal should be to walk out of the status
meeting knowing that the testing team and its work have been
represented well.</p>

<p>As the test manager, you are the keeper of data that can help
you understand trends and special occurrences in the project,
provided you avoid the two &quot;data traps&quot;: having
unjustified faith in numbers, and rejecting numbers completely
because they're imperfect. Take a balanced view and use data as a
springboard to understanding.</p>
