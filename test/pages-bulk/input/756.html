<strong>Seeing the Aura</strong><br>
<br>
This exercise is designed to see Aura for the first time and/or practice seeing 
Auras. Choosing good conditions is important: not only you see the Aura better, 
but also to gain a confidence about what you see.

<ol>
<li>Situate the person in front of a very softly illuminated PLAIN WHITE background. 
A color background will change Aura colors, so you need additional knowledge about 
combining colors. Some combinations of background and Aura colors may cause misinterpretation 
problems.<br>
</li>
<li>Choose ONE SPOT to look at. The middle of the forehead is VERY GOOD. This 
is a location of so called Brow Chakra or the Third Eye. In some cultures (India) 
they put a mark on a forehead. Such a mark in ancient times could mean the invitation 
to look and see the Aura.<br>
</li>
<li>Look at this spot for 30 to 60 seconds or longer<br>
</li>
<li>After 30 seconds analyze surroundings with your peripheral vision, while still 
looking at the same spot. <strong>Continuing the concentration is most important. 
Resist temptation to look around.</strong> You should see that the background 
nearby the person is brighter and has a DIFFERENT color than the background further 
away. This is your own perception of the Aura. The longer you concentrate, the 
better you will see it. Remember, concentration on one spot increases your sensitivity 
by accumulating the effect of the Aura vibration reaching your eyes.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Taking a SNAPSHOT of an Aura.</strong><br> <br>
After concentrating long enough to see the aura, close your eyes. For a second 
or two you will see the Aura ONLY. Be prepared. You have only one second or two 
until your photosensitive cells will stop vibrating and sending visual sensations 
to the brain. And if you miss is, you have to start concentrating again. Try to 
experiment how fast or slow you should close your eyes.<br><br>

<p class="text"><strong>Observing auras of other people<br>
</strong><br>
The best is to look directly at someone's brow chakra (third eye or wisdom eye, 
which is located @1.5 cm above the nose, between eyes) and aim to achieve the 
state of mind similar to the concentration technique described above for at least 
30-60 seconds. I have tried also looking at throat and heart chakras with similar 
results. However, if you concentrate on someone's chest it looks so unusual that 
the person concerned is usually very uneasy about it. When you look into someone's 
brow chakra you can actually continue conversation.<br>
<br>
Again, VERY softly illuminated background, with no shadows is best. With practice, 
any uniformly illuminated background (such as a blue sky for example) will suffice.<br>
<br>
<strong>How to see your own Aura</strong><br>
<br>
Stand about 1.5 m in front of a good size mirror. In the beginning it is best 
if the background behind you is plain white and there are no shadows. Illumination 
should be VERY soft and uniform not bright. Follow instructions above for seeing 
Auras.<br>
<br>
PRACTICE for at least 10-15 minutes each day to increase your sensitivity and 
develop Auric sight. Remember that practice is required to develop Auric sight.<br>
<br>
<strong>Auric sight and after-images </strong><br>
<br>
One of the most frequently asked questions during my workshops is: &quot;Tom, 
are my eyes playing tricks on me ?&quot; The answer is no, you have just learnt 
to pay attention to what your eyes are capable of. Light sensors in our eyes (Red 
Green and Blue) are vibration sensors which are highly non-linear and they have 
memory. The consequence of memory is that they can oscillate for up to several 
seconds after the visual stimulation has been discontinued.<br>
<br>
This memory of visual stimulation is frequently perceived as afterimage. Afterimages 
have a precisely the same shape as original images. Afterimage of an object surrounded 
by its Aura is larger than the original image. The increase in such afterimage 
is due to the vibration of an Aura and actually represents a &quot;snapshot&quot; 
of an Aura. It is therefore essential to focus at one spot when watching the Aura 
and resist temptation to change the point of focus, otherwise an image of the 
Aura may become confused with the afterimage of an object.<br>
<br>
<strong>Meaning of Aura and its colors</strong><br>
<br>
The Aura is a reflection of our True Nature at any given moment. At this point 
it is perhaps necessary to explain what do I mean by &quot;True Nature&quot; and 
why some effort is necessary to &quot;discover&quot; it. Our society seems to 
emphasize symbols, stereotypes, habits, manners, superficial behavior, pretending, 
following others and submitting free will to some &quot;leaders&quot;. Our &quot;education&quot; 
seems to be based on views and expectations of people who try to control the flock.<br>
<br>
Our True Nature is what is left when we recognize and discard all our habits, 
stereotypes, manners, and pretending, superficial behavior and become fully conscious, 
truly natural and spontaneous. Note that some people are so attached to their 
manners and habits that it is very hard, if not impossible, to discover who they 
really are. The only way to get an instant insight into their personality seems 
to be by watching their Aura, because the Aura shows their True Nature, behind 
any facade of superficial behavior.<br>
<br>
In general, the more colorful, cleaner and brighter the Aura, the better and more 
spiritually advanced is the person. Also, the more uniform the energy distribution 
in the Aura, the healthier and more balanced the person is.<br>
<br>
Distribution of the energy in the Aura seems to have the potential of a <a href="http://kirlianresearch.com" target="_blank">powerful 
medical diagnostic tool</a>, but usually requires using a complex equipment. The 
scope of this article is to concentrate on what we can easily see with our eyes.<br>
<br>
Our Aura surrounds the entire body, but the interpretation of colors below relates 
to the Aura around the head only. Meaning of colors around the head presented 
below suggested in the literature has been confirmed by the author. When you learn 
to see Aura well, you can verify it for yourself, by concentrating on certain 
thoughts while watching your Aura, or telling people what their thoughts are when 
you see their Auras.<br>
<br>
Usually, people have one or two dominating colors (strong points) in their Aura. 
These colors (or their Auric pairs) will be most likely their favorite colors.<br>
<br>
In addition to dominant colors, the Aura reflects thoughts, feelings and desires, 
which appear like &quot;flashes&quot;, &quot;clouds&quot; or &quot;flames&quot;, 
usually further away from the head. For example a flash of orange in the Aura 
indicates a thought or desire to exercise power and control. Orange as a dominant 
color is a sign of power and general ability to control people. Quickly changing 
&quot;flashes&quot; indicate quickly changing thoughts.<br>
<br>
<strong>Meaning of Clean Colors of the Aura <br>
(colors of the rainbow, bright, shiny, monochromatic colors):</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Purple:</strong> indicates spiritual thoughts. Purple is never a strong 
point in the Aura. It appears only as temporary &quot;clouds&quot; and &quot;flames&quot;, 
indicating truly spiritual thoughts.<br>
<br>
<strong>Blue:</strong> Balanced existence, sustaining life, eased nerve system, 
transmitting forces and energy. People with blue strong point in their Aura are 
relaxed, balanced and feel ready to live in a cave and survive. They are born 
survivors. Blue thought is a thought about relaxing the nerve system to achieve 
the balance of the mind or a thought about surviving. Electric blue can override 
any other color in the Aura, when the person is receiving and/or transmitting 
information in a telepathic communication. For example Michel Desmarquet, author 
of &quot;<a href="mic.htm" target="_blank">Thiaoouba Prophecy</a>&quot;, frequently 
glows with the electric blue during his lectures, especially when he answers questions 
from the public.<br>
<br>
<strong>Turquoise:</strong> indicates dynamic quality of being, highly energized 
personality, capable of projection, influencing other people. People with turquoise 
strong point in their Aura can do many things simultaneously and are good organizers. 
They feel bored when forced to concentrate on one thing. People love bosses with 
turquoise Auras, because such bosses explain their goals and influence their team 
rather than demand executing their commands. Turquoise thought is a thought about 
organizing and influencing others.<br>
<br>
<strong>Green:</strong> restful, modifying energy, natural healing ability. All 
natural healers should have it. People with a green strong point in their Auras 
are natural healers. The stronger the green Aura, the better the healer. They 
also love gardening and usually have a &quot;green hand&quot; - anything grows 
for them. Being in a presence of a person with a strong and green Aura is a very 
peaceful and restful experience. Green thought indicates a restful state and healing.<br>
<br>
<strong>Yellow:</strong> joy, freedom, non-attachment, freeing or releasing vital 
forces. People who glow yellow are full of inner joy, very generous and not attached 
to anything. Yellow halo around the head: high spiritual development. A signature 
of a spiritual teacher. Do not accept spiritual teachings from anyone who does 
not have such a yellow halo. Buddha and Christ had yellow halos extending to their 
arms. Today it is rare on Earth to find a person with a halo larger than 1 inch. 
Yellow halo appears as a result of a highly active brow chakra (which can be seen 
glowing with violet by many people at my workshops). Highly spiritual people stimulate 
the brow chakra continuously for many years, because they always have intensive 
spiritual thoughts in their minds. When this chakra is observed when highly active, 
a yellow (Auric pair) halo appears around it, surrounding the entire head. Yellow 
thought indicates a moment of joy and contentment.<br>
<br>
<strong>Orange:</strong> uplifting and absorbing. Inspiring. A sign of power. 
Ability and/or desire to control people. When orange becomes a strong point, it 
usually contributes to a yellow halo, which then becomes gold, indicating not 
only a spiritual teacher, but a powerful spiritual teacher, someone capable of 
demonstrating his/her unique abilities. Orange thought is a thought about exercising 
power or a desire to control people.<br>
<br>
<strong>Red:</strong> materialistic thoughts, thoughts about the physical body. 
Predominantly red Aura indicates materialistically oriented person.<br>
<br>
<strong>Pink</strong> (=purple+red): love (in a spiritual sense). To obtain a 
clean pink, you need to mix the purple (the highest frequency we perceive) with 
red (the lowest frequency). Pink Aura indicates that the person achieved a perfect 
balance between spiritual awareness and the material existence. The most advanced 
people have not only a yellow halo around the head (a permanent strong point in 
the Aura) but also a large pink Aura extending further away. The pink color in 
the Aura is quite rare on Earth and appears only as a temporary thought, never 
as a strong point in the Aura.</p>
<p class="text"><strong>Meaning of Dirty colors:</strong> <br>
(colors appearing darker than background more like a smoke than a glow)<br>
<br>
<strong>Brown:</strong> unsettling, distracting, materialistic, negating spirituality.<br>
<br>
<strong>Gray:</strong> dark thoughts, depressing thoughts, unclear intentions, 
presence of a dark side of personality.<br>
<br>
<strong>Sulfur</strong> (color of a mustard): pain or lack of ease, anger<br>
<br>
<strong>White:</strong> serious disease, artificial stimulation (drugs). Why does 
the white color in the Aura indicate problems? White color is like a noise, rather 
than a set of harmonious tones (monochromatic colors). It is impossible to &quot;tune&quot; 
the noise to an orchestra playing harmonious music, hence the white Aura indicates 
a lack of harmony in the body and mind. Nature, which we are a part of, is harmonious. 
This harmony comes in discrete vibration &quot;tones&quot; or harmonics, partially 
described by the modern quantum physics. <br>
Several hours before the death, the Aura becomes white, and greatly increases 
in intensity. For this reason in most cultures &quot;death&quot; is depicted in 
WHITE (not black), because in the past, people could actually see a white Aura 
before death. It seems that our ancestors knew much more than we are prepared 
to admit.<br>
<br>
