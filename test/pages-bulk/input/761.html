      <h2>Executive Summary (continued)</h2>
      <h3>Summary of Treasury&#146;s Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Forecasts</h3>
      <p>This summary sets out the economic and fiscal outlook for the next
      three years. A number of risks to the outlook may lead to a significant
      change in the growth path. Scenarios for higher and lower than forecast
      growth provide illustration.</p>
      <h4>The Economic Outlook</h4>
      <h5>Steady export-led growth on the back of a positive world outlook.</h5>
      <p>Figure 1 &#150; GDP growth</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="images/Image133.gif" alt="Figure 1 &#150; GDP growth" WIDTH="322" HEIGHT="198"></p>
      <p>Sources: Statistics New Zealand, The Treasury</p>
      <p>Despite contracting in the June 1999 quarter, the economy is set for
      solid expansion with quarterly growth expected to run somewhat above trend
      over the early part of the forecast period. Annual average growth is
      expected to be around 2&#189;% in the year to March 2000, 3&#189;% in the
      following two years, and 3% in the final year of the forecast period.</p>
      <p>Conditions for growth remain positive. Stronger world demand and a more
      competitive exchange rate mean exports now count for a greater proportion
      of growth than at Budget time - although overall growth in the out years
      remains little changed.</p>
      <p>Figure 2 &#150; Trading partner growth</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="images/Image134.gif" alt="Figure 2 &#150; Trading partner growth" WIDTH="322" HEIGHT="198"></p>
      <p>Sources: Consensus Forecasts Inc, The Treasury</p>
      <p>Global growth prospects have improved through this year. Trading
      partner growth is now expected to be 3% in both 1999 and 2000. For 1999
      this marks a doubling on the growth expected at the start of the year.
      Monetary conditions also remain stimulatory with low interest rates and a
      competitive exchange rate.</p>
      <p>Robust growth in manufactured exports and tourism activity is expected
      to continue, underpinned by stronger global demand and a competitive
      exchange rate. The America&#146;s Cup and the Sydney Olympics give an
      additional boost to the tourism sector. Commodity exporters are expected
      to shake off the effects of the droughts and gain from recovering world
      commodity prices.</p>
      <h5>Boost from strengthening labour market partly offset by price and debt
      pressures.</h5>
      <p>Figure 3 &#150; Employment and unemployment</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="images/Image135.gif" alt="Figure 3 &#150; Employment and unemployment" WIDTH="322" HEIGHT="198"></p>
      <p>Sources: Statistics New Zealand, The Treasury</p>
      <p>Household spending is supported by steady employment and wage growth.
      Firms are expected to lift their demand for staff in line with a steadily
      growing economy. Employment growth peaks at an annual 2.7% in 2001. The
      unemployment rate falls to below 6% in 2001/02. Incomes receive an
      additional fillip in the March 2001 year from the planned tax cuts.</p>
      <p>Figure 4 &#150; Household debt and debt servicing</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="images/Image136.gif" alt="Figure 4 &#150; Household debt and debt servicing" WIDTH="322" HEIGHT="198"></p>
      <p>Sources: Statistics New Zealand, The Treasury</p>
      <p>However, in the near term households feel the pressure of rising oil
      prices. Over the medium-term, increasing debt levels and rising debt
      servicing costs see spending growth slow and savings modestly rebuilt.</p>
      <h5>Modest tightening in monetary conditions.</h5>
      <p>The economy is likely to run into capacity constraints by around late
      2000. However, a modest monetary tightening wards off inflationary
      pressures. This keeps the economy on a sustainable growth path.</p>
      <p>Figure 5 &#150; Consumers price index excluding credit services</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="images/Image137.gif" alt="Figure 5 &#150; Consumers price index excluding credit services" WIDTH="322" HEIGHT="198"></p>
      <p>Sources: Statistics New Zealand, The Treasury</p>
      <p>Short-term interest rates are forecast to climb to 7.0% by the 2002
      year and the exchange rate is expected to show a modest rise. The
      continuing large current account deficit is assumed to limit the rise in
      the exchange rate.</p>
      <p>Rising oil prices are largely behind a spike in annual inflation to
      2.7% in the year to March 2000. This is not, however, expected to lead to
      more sustained inflationary pressures.</p>
      <p>Figure 6 &#150; Current account</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="images/Image138.gif" alt="Figure 6 &#150; Current account" WIDTH="322" HEIGHT="198"></p>
      <p>Sources: Statistics New Zealand, The Treasury</p>
      <p>In the near term, the oil price rise and some one-off large imports,
      such as a frigate, and higher returns to foreign direct investment in New
      Zealand, see the current account deficit increase to 8.3% of GDP. That is
      expected to improve over the forecast horizon, falling to 5.8% of GDP by
      the end of the period.</p>
      <h4>The Fiscal Outlook</h4>
      <h5>Operating balance grows with revenue growth outpacing expense growth.</h5>
      <p>Figure 7 &#150; Operating balance</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="images/Image139.gif" alt="Figure 7 &#150; Operating balance" WIDTH="322" HEIGHT="198"></p>
      <p>Source: The Treasury</p>
      <p>The 1998/99 operating balance of $1.8 billion was boosted by large
      one-off items including gains on sale of assets. Excluding the one-off
      items, the operating balance was around $150 million.</p>
      <p>The 1999/2000 operating balance of $14 million reflects:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the absence of any similar large one-off items&nbsp;</li>
        <li>lower SOE and Crown entity surpluses, with the recognition of the
          ACC outstanding claims liability (around $500 million)</li>
        <li>expense growth, mainly in social welfare, health and education
          (around $800 million)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These effects are partly offset by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>growth in tax revenue (around $1,200 million) arising from the
          economic recovery.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Beyond 1999/2000 the operating balance rises, with revenue growth
      (averaging 4.8% a year) outpacing expense growth (averaging 2.8% a year).</p>
      <p>As a percentage of GDP, expenses fall between 1999/2000 and 2002/03
      from 35% to 33%.</p>
      <p>Figure 8 &#150; Expenses ($ and % of GDP)</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="images/Image140.gif" alt="Figure 8 &#150; Expenses ($ and % of GDP)" WIDTH="322" HEIGHT="198"></p>
      <p>Source: The Treasury</p>
      <p>In dollar terms, over the same period, expenses increase from $36
      billion to $39 billion reflecting:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>growth in the provision for future initiatives of $1,460 million,
          providing for the cost of future policy decisions</li>
        <li>CPI indexation and beneficiary growth of around $800 million&#150; most
          growth is after 2001 when the New Zealand Superannuation (NZS)
          eligibility age settles at 65</li>
        <li>health and education spending increases of $800 million.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Net debt is stable in dollar terms, but falls as a percentage of GDP,
      over the forecast period.</h5>
      <p>Figure 9 &#150; Net debt (% of GDP and $)</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="images/Image141.gif" alt="Figure 9 &#150; Net debt (% of GDP and $)" WIDTH="322" HEIGHT="198"></p>
      <p>Source: The Treasury</p>
      <p>In 1998/99 net debt was $21.7 billion. Net debt rises in 1999/2000 and
      2000/01 before falling to slightly below its 1998/99 level.</p>
      <p>The rise reflects:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>an operating cash deficit</li>
        <li>increased capital investment for health, education and capital
          investment for At Work Insurance (1999/2000 only).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Improving operating cash-flows drive the fall in 2001/02 and 2002/03.</p>
      <p>As a percentage of GDP net debt falls from 21.8% to 17.8% between
      1998/99 and 2002/03 as nominal GDP grows.</p>
      <h5>Net worth grows over the forecast period.</h5>
      <p>Figure 10 &#150; Net worth</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="images/Image142.gif" alt="Figure 10 &#150; Net worth" WIDTH="322" HEIGHT="198"></p>
      <p>Source: The Treasury</p>
      <p>In 1998/99 net worth fell from $10 billion to $6 billion. The fall
      reflects ARCIC&#146;s recognition of the future cost of already accepted ACC
      claims ($6.1 billion), partly offset by a $1.8 billion operating surplus.</p>
      <p>Beyond 1999/2000, net worth increases in line with operating balance
      surpluses.</p>
      <h5>Compared to Budget, the operating balance is largely unchanged, but
      net debt and net worth improve.</h5>
      <p>The operating balance forecasts are largely unchanged from the Budget.
      The balance is $50 million higher in 1999/2000, $6 million higher in
      2000/01 and $155 million higher 2001/02, reflecting:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>higher nominal GDP forecasts, increasing tax revenue and slightly
          reducing benefit spending</li>
        <li>the removal of the contingency expense provision for legal
          liabilities ($100 million a year).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These effects are largely offset by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a downward revision to the estimated 1998/99 corporate tax base
          following higher than forecast overpayments of corporate tax. This
          impacts on all years.</li>
        <li>tax rate reductions. By the end of the forecast period these are
          largely funded from the provision for future initiatives. The
          remainder lowers the operating balance by $245 million, $165 million
          and $85 million in 2000/01, 2001/02 and 2002/03 respectively.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Net worth forecasts, however, are stronger by between $650 million and
      $830 million over the forecast period largely reflecting the lower ACC
      outstanding claims liability valuation at 30 June 1999.</p>
      <p>Net debt forecasts are lower by between $100 and $300 million. These
      improvements largely reflect a better starting position in 1998/99 than
      forecast in the Budget and stronger dividend flows from SOEs in 1999/2000.</p>
      <h4>Risks and Scenarios</h4>
      <p>The Central Forecast embodies a steady export-led expansion. As always
      there are risks and uncertainties surrounding this central track, raising
      the prospect of the economy following quite different growth paths to that
      presented here. Stronger world growth, for example, could see additional
      strength in our economy over the first part of the forecast period. The
      economy would hit capacity constraints sooner, producing a sharper cycle
      than forecast.</p>
      <p>Figure 11 &#150; Real GDP growth</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="images/Image143.gif" alt="Figure 11 &#150; Real GDP growth" WIDTH="322" HEIGHT="198"></p>
      <p>Sources: Statistics New Zealand, The Treasury</p>
      <p>But there are also risks around the sustainability of the current
      global recovery: most prominently, the possibility of a sharp correction
      in equity prices in the US. Slower world growth would undermine the
      strength of New Zealand&#146;s recovery leading to a more modest growth path
      than envisaged here.</p>
      <p>There are also risks associated with the domestic economy. The June
      quarter GDP outturn has raised the possibility of some near term weakness.
      Over the medium term it is by no means certain how consumers will react to
      higher debt.</p>
      <p>If any of these circumstances were to develop differently than allowed
      for in the Central Forecast, they could produce outcomes where economic
      growth is stronger or weaker than embodied in the Central Forecast. This
      would have flow on effects for the fiscal forecasts.</p>
      <p>Examples of a high growth (Stronger World Economy) scenario and a low
      growth (Weaker World and Household Sector) scenario help illustrate some
      of these risks.</p>
      <p>Figure 12 &#150; Operating balance</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="images/Image144.gif" alt="Figure 12 &#150; Operating balance" WIDTH="325" HEIGHT="181"></p>
      <p>Source: The Treasury</p>
      <p>Alternative economic scenarios lead to alternative fiscal outcomes,
      mainly because of differences in the outlook for nominal GDP, a key driver
      of tax revenue. The Stronger World Economy scenario leads to a stronger
      operating balance throughout the forecast period. In contrast, the Weaker
      World and Household Sector scenario sees the operating balance record
      modest deficits in the first two years of the forecast period, but return
      to surplus over the final two years.</p>
