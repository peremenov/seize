          In the face of hovering war clouds and the increased campaign of the Pakistan-aided militants in the country,  the Centre has asked the Haryana Government to invigorate its intelligence and internal security system. <p>According to sources,  the Union Home Ministry has communicated to the  state government the need to tighten its intelligence and security system. The state government has directed the deputy commissioners and all authorities concerned for follow up action in compliance with the Central directive. <p>According to observers such directives from the Centre are issued only at the time of emergency, especially on or before war and is sent to all states. <p>According to reports,  almost all of the district administrations in Haryana have swung into action following the communication from the state government. <p>Although the directive of the Centre covers the entire state, some of the districts, especially the ones falling under National Capital Region (NCR) and south Haryana are the most sensitive. Also, the areas bordering Sriganganagar district in Rajasthan, which are closer to Indo-Pakistan border are said to be on the watch list of the Haryana security forces. <p>Gurgaon, Faridabad, Jhajjar and Sonepat districts are said to be under special vigil. <p>The Gurgaon administration has launched a drive as a follow-up action. The Administration is in the midst of issuing a order for stepping up drive to get the identities of the tenants in the district verified. The cut-off date for ascertaining the identities was December 1.  The domestic workers and guards could also fall in the ambit. The onus to inform the police lies on the landlords and those who employ domestics. A senior member of the administration said the order would be issued with in 24 hours. <p>The proposed order specifically covers the Mewat area of this district. Of late, Mewat areas falling in Gurgaon and Faridabad districts have proved to be happy hunting ground for the Pakistan’s ISI. Recently the CBI conducted raids in villages of Mewat and seized arms and ammunition. A native of  Mewat was caught while carrying arms in Gujarat to be used by terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir. There have been other occasions when Mewat residents were nabbed acting as agents of the ISI and carrying fire arms and explosives. <p>The ammunition
          depot of the Indian Force and corporate offices of various multinational companies, are also located here. <p>Also, “Theekri pehra” (night vigil by villagers) will be enforced. The onus for it will lie on the sarpanch and numberdar of the villages concerned. <p>The sources said such measures were likely to be followed in all districts of Haryana.&nbsp; <p></font><a href="#top"><img src="../graphics/top.gif"

          Even as considerable heat has been generated in Haryana over various steps taken by the state government in the power sector, the Power Utilities have played it safe by not proposing any increase in tariff during the next financial year.<p>The proposed ARR (annual revenue requirement) for the year 2002-2003, submitted by the utilities to the Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission, gives the impression that there will no increase in power tariff. The proposal, submitted by the Power Utilities  on the evening of December 31 was not accompanied with any tariff application. <p>There is a gap of Rs 110 crore between the expenditure and the earnings of the utilities in the latest ARR . However, instead of asking for an increase in tariff, the utilities proposed the formulation of  “regulatory assets” to the commission for managing the shortfall in revenue collection.<p>Asked if the absence of a tariff application in the ARR proposal indicated that there would be no increase in power tariff in 2002-2003, an official of the utilities, said: “We felt that a review of the tariff structure was not
          necessary for the time being”. <p>Sources said that since the erstwhile HSEB was split up, three ARR proposals, including the one given on December 31, had been submitted by the utilities to the HERC.  The first ARR, submitted for 2000-2001, did not have any tariff proposal as part of it and at that time also the utilities had suggested the formulation of regulatory assets for managing the gap between expenditure and revenue collection. The HERC accepted the utilities’ request and there was no increase in  tariff for that year.<p>The next ARR, for 2001-2002, submitted by the utilities was accompanied with a tariff application. The tariff application was examined by the HERC by going through the formal procedures following which it passed its order.<p>Though the utilities did not file any tariff application with its ARR this time, the HERC, after examining the ARR and going through the process of public hearing, may still ask the utilities to review the prevailing tariff structure, an official said. <p>The utilities, too, may submit an application to the HERC later if it feels the need for reviewing the tariff, they add. <p></font><a href="#top"><img src="../graphics/top.gif"

          The BSP is all set to shed its “Dalit image” and with that end in view it may even field a non-Dalit candidate for the February 21 Yamunanagar Assembly by-election.<p>An indication to this effect was given by Mr Ashok Sherwal,  president of the Haryana unit of the party, here today. All efforts would be made to give the ticket to the candidate of a majority community which had gone unrepresented in Haryana Assembly, Mr Sherwal said, adding that the BSP would go all alone in the by-election.<p>This is the first time that the party had made a panel of about 15 candidates on the caste basis. The candidate would be selected from among them on January 5 in consultation with the party high command. According to observers, there are about 35,000 Dalits and Punjabis each in the constituency followed by 25,000 Brahmins and 15,000 Muslims.<p>Party sources said the candidate could be from outside the Assembly segment. There is likely to be a race for the ticket between the Punjabi and Dalit lobbies as in terms of strength, they were ahead of the order communities.<p>It may be recalled that in the last Assembly elections held in February 2,000, the BSP candidate, Mr Randhir Chaudhary, was placed third and had  secured over 17,000  votes. The Congress candidate, Mr J.P. Sharma, whose death had necessitated the by-election, had won the seat by securing over 20,000 votes.<p>On Mr Chaudhary throwing in his lot with the rebel BSP leader, Mr Aman Kumar Nagra, Mr Sherwal claimed that this would not have any effect on party’s fortunes in the election as the BSP had a committed vote-bank. The BSP was a cadre-based party wedded to a particular ideology and Mr Chaudhary’s departure would hardly have any impact on it, he quipped.<p>In fact, in the wake of changed political scenario in the state, the BSP stood  a better chance to win the seat as the public was fed up with the Congress, the BJP and the INLD. Every party had misled the public and failed to fulfil the promises, he said.<p>Mr Sherwal feared
          large scale misuse of  official machinery by the Chautala-led government. If this happened the party would approach the Election Commission, he said.<p>When asked whether the formation of the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) by the  Union Coal Minister, Mr Ram Vilas Paswan, would divide the Dalit vote-bank, Mr Sherwal stated that the LJP was a marginal player in the national politics and had been propped up by the Congress and the BJP.</font>

          The defaulting electricity consumers in the rural areas appear to be wary of the new policy which proposes the delinking of current power bills from the outstanding bills.<p>As per the policy, interest and surcharge on outstanding bills would be waived and consumers asked to pay only the original bill according to their convenience. <p>Senior officers in the district and the ruling INLD functionaries on Monday visited the ‘problem’ villages to educate consumers about the new policy and persuade them to pay current bills.<p>Encouraged by the response to the new scheme, the INLD yesterday launched a political offensive to isolate those who had been provoking farmers against the payment of the bills. Prominent persons belonging to the ‘problem villages’ were invited for a meeting with Mr Dhir Pal Singh, Town and Country Planning Minister, here to sort out the problem to the satisfaction of consumers and HVPN officials.<p>Mr Dhir Pal Singh, claimed that the new policy was the only workable solution to the waxed problem. He advised defaulting consumers not to miss the opportunity and start a new chapter on New Year day.<p>Village leaders, appreciating the new policy, blamed HVPN officials also for the present situation. <p>They told the minister that HVPN officials never visited consumers for actual meter reading thereby forcing them to default in the payment of bills. The employees had not even distributed the bills among the consumers.<p>The Deputy Commissioner, Mr Anil Malik, assured that current bills would be distributed in a week’s time and HVPN officials would hold camps in their respective villages to rectify the faulty bills. <p>The district administration has, meanwhile, decided to launch a special campaign against ‘kundi’ connections.<p>Mr Dhirpal Singh said certain leaders were misleading the farmers for their ‘personal’ gains.<p>Among those who attended the meeting were Capt Inder Singh, MP, Mr Balwant Singh Myna, Mr Balbir Singh Bali, both MLAs, and Mr Dharam Pal Chairman, Zila Parishad.<p></font><a href="#top"><img src="../graphics/top.gif"
