        New pension</a> scheme&nbsp;eyewash, says Forum<br>
          </font><font face="Verdana" size="2">
        Tribune News Service</font></b><font size="2" face="Verdana">
        <p>Chandigarh, July 16<br>
        The much-awaited ‘‘Varishtha Pension Bima Yojna’’ that promise a guaranteed 9 per cent return to the persons above 55 has attracted mixed response from the public. While the LIC is enthused by ‘‘overwhelming response’’ from the public, a section of senior citizens is still weighing the pros and cons of the scheme.<p>Ms Deba Shree Varma, Senior Divisional Manager, LIC, Chandigarh Division, claims, ‘‘We have collected over Rs 1 crore premium within two days after the launch of the scheme. In fact, the senior citizens are looking for agents to buy the scheme.’’ Reports from other regions revealed that the a large number of senior citizens are buying the product. Mr Janak Kumar, Senior Divisional Manager, LIC, Jalandhar Division, said: ‘‘The senior citizens are  investing up to the highest limit of Rs 2.66 lakh. We are sure that the Jalandhar division will garner over Rs 100 crore through the scheme.’’<p>However, Mr R.K. Kaplash, Vice-President, the Consumer Forum, Chandigarh, felt that the scheme is a mere eyewash. He said, ‘‘the government has deceived the public by putting a condition of the 15-year lock-in period and income tax on the returns from the scheme.’’ He wondered how the senior citizens will benefit from the assured return of 9 per cent when they have to keep their savings for 15 years. Further, the interest rate may increase in the coming years and the government has not made a provision of an increase in return in that case.<p>The pension scheme of the Postal Department is already offering a return of above 8 per cent. After income tax deductions the actual return will not be substantially higher than other schemes. He said, ‘‘if the government really wants to help the middle class it should not have announced any lock-in period, or 10.5 per cent interest for the loans taken from the investment.’’ <p>Another retired Army official said the condition that only one person can invest in the scheme had created a peculiar situation. The government should raise the investment limit up to atleast Rs 5 lakh and allow the couples to invest separately. <p>Ms Varma claimed that the LIC has plans to invest the amount in such areas where it will fetch at least 7 per cent returns. The government will have to subsidise the returns by just 2 per cent. Mr Janak Kumar claimed that all pension schemes are taxable under the Income Tax Act. However, there will be a small segment of the senior citizens who will have to pay the tax after standard deductions.&nbsp;

        Bangalore, July 16<br>
        Maruti Udyog Limited (MUL) has increased its marketshare in domestic car market by 3.5 per cent to 55 per cent in this April-June compared with the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal, its Managing Director Jagdish Khattar said today.</p>
          <p>While the car industry grew by 28 per cent in Q1 of 2003-04, Maruti grew by 37 per cent during the period, he told reporters here. After the car-maker signed an MoU with State Bank of Mysore on offering car financing in Karnataka. <p>Khattar said Maruti had already entered into an alliance on car finance with State Bank of India and State Bank of Patiala and would do so with State Bank of Indore and State Bank of Hyderabad in the next few days. Highlighting the importance of car financing, he said the share of car financing in percentage of sales by the car industry in India had gone up from 50 per cent five years ago to 75 per cent now.

 Pakistan industrialists are hopeful that efforts of the political leadership in India and Pakistan to improve relations will open new vistas of economic development. <p>Opening of trade between both countries will be mutually beneficial and contribute to the economic development of the region, said Mr Aslam Anjum Chaudhary, Chairman, the Standing Committee on Trade and Cottage Industries (FPCCI), Pakistan, and member of the Pakistani business delegation, currently on visit to India.<p>In an interview to The Tribune, he claimed that Pakistani industrialists are impressed by the technology developments in India, especially in the field of  IT, pharmaceutical and engineering sectors.  <p>Though some people are scared that India will gain in a big way, the Pakistan industry will also substantially gain from the trade.’’ <p>Later, he said, the Indian companies can have joint ventures with in Pakistan to explore markets in other countries as well.<p>Mr Chaudhary is also the President, Sargodha Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry and Vice- Chairman of the Faisalabad Dry Port (Trust). He deals with export and import of fruits, tyres, textile, chemicals and engineering goods. <p>He was here to explore the import of Swaraj Tractors. There was an annual demand of over 40,000 tractors in Pakistan. Though Massey Ferguson and Fiat were major brands there but the industry has good scope.<p>At present the imports of engineering and pharmaceutical goods from India are on the negative list, but the industry is hopeful that the present government will allow to import these goods.<p>The government has already allowed the import of tyres and tubes and some other goods from India.  Further, by the end of 2004, under WTO conditions both countries will have to open trade, he added. <p>He disclosed in the field of textile, leather and agricultural commodities both countries can start trade. The current trade was pegged at about $2 billion. With the improvement in economic ties, the trade can double immediately. <p>Regarding the threat to the local industry, Mr Chaudhary said Chinese goods were popular in his country and Indian manufacturers will have to compete with them. <p>However, he said, due to lower transport costs, it will  be more profitable for Pakistanis to purchase  tractors, automobiles and other goods from India. Similarly India can import leather, textile and agricultural products from Pakistan at a much cheaper rate.&nbsp;

        ‘The Governments of India and Pakistan must share the blame for keeping the region poverty-stricken as large funds were being wasted on military’, remarks the Vice-Chairman of Saarc business group in Pakistan, Mr Jamil Ahmad
        Magoon.<p>Talking to exclusively to The Tribune reporter today after winding up the 12 day visit Mr Magoon said both the countries must decide to remove all restrictions for a free trade zone which will benefit both the countries and bring prosperity.<p>Mr
        Magoon, who had also met the Prime Minister in Delhi, had requested him to take positive steps to build up trade ties and ease visa restrictions so that Pakistan businessmen can come freely without any hurdles. This will usher an era of trust and mutual faith which had been lacking between both the countries due to animosity for the past many decades.<p>He said India can offer a large number of items, including machinery of all kinds, chemicals and dyes, medicines, tea, spices and large quantity of other essential item while Pakistan can offer rock salt, sugar, dry fruits, crude drugs, etc.<p>The delegation is confident that India must offer access to Pakistani goods while providing services and technical know-how and various other items in return. Pakistan is not over awed by India’s development and will welcome all possible concessions for much smaller country like Pakistan.<p>Earlier the delegation visited the

In a consultation paper issued today, TRAI has sought opinion of stakeholders on migrating from a service specific regime to a unified licensing regime, which is prevalent in a number of countries and has recently been mandated for the EU member nations.<p>A unified licensing regime would enable service providers to offer both fixed and mobile services. “This would benefit the service providers and consumers, as there would be efficiency gains through synergies of infrastructure, networks and services,” a TRAI press release said.<p>In India, the basic and cellular mobile services have been licensed separately. However, a certain amount of convergence in the terms and conditions of licence already exist such as both the basic and cellular service providers pay the same annual licence fees, both the service providers have common access to Universal Service Fund and can offer mobility.<p>The TRAI consultations will cover entry fees, extent of mobility, roll out obligation, performance bank guarantee, and spectrum allocation procedure.<p>Along with these, there are some other issues pertaining to
        inteconnection, number etc, will also be discussed.<p>Mergers and acquisition have been quite common in the industry over the recent years. However, intra-circle mergers, which are of a horizontal nature, have not been permitted so far. Creation of a unified licence would result in a larger number of players offering the same basket of services, and may lead to the need of allowing intra-circle mergers and acquisitions, the TRAI statement said.
