  <li><h4><a HREF="260.htm#nature">Nature of the Work</a></h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Many people like animals. But, as pet owners can attest, taking care of them is hard
      work. Animal caretakers, sometimes called animal attendants or animal keepers, feed,
      water, groom, bathe, and exercise animals and clean, disinfect, and repair their cages.
      They also play with the animals, provide companionship, and observe behavioral changes
      that could indicate illness or injury. <br>
      <br>
      Kennels, animal shelters, animal hospitals and clinics, stables, laboratories, aquariums,
      and zoological parks all house animals and employ caretakers. Job titles and duties vary
      by employment setting.<br>
      <br>
      Kennel staff usually care for small companion animals like dogs and cats while their
      owners are working or traveling out of town. Beginning attendants perform basic tasks,
      such as cleaning cages and dog runs, filling food and water dishes, and exercising
      animals. Experienced attendants may provide basic animal health care, bathe and groom
      animals, and clean their ears. Caretakers who work in kennels also sell pet food and
      supplies, assist in obedience training, help with breeding, or prepare animals for
      shipping.<br>
      <br>
      Animal caretakers who specialize in grooming, or maintaining a pet's&#151;usually a dog's
      or cat's&#151;appearance are called groomers. Some groomers work in kennels and others
      operate their own grooming business. Groomers answer telephones, schedule appointments,
      discuss with clients how they want their pets to look, and collect information on the
      pet's disposition and veterinarian. Grooming the pet involves several steps: An initial
      brush-out is followed by a first clipping of hair or fur using electric clippers, combs,
      and grooming shears; the groomer then cuts the nails, cleans the ears, bathes, and
      blow-dries the animal, and ends with a final clipping and styling. <br>
      <br>
      Animal caretakers in animal shelters perform a variety of duties and work with a wide
      variety of animals. In addition to attending to the basic needs of the animals, caretakers
      must also keep records of the animals received and discharged and any tests or treatments
      done. Some vaccinate newly admitted animals under the direction of a veterinarian, and
      euthanize (put to death) seriously ill, severely injured, or unwanted animals. Caretakers
      in animal shelters also interact with the public, answering telephone inquiries, screening
      applicants for animal adoption, or educating visitors on neutering and other animal health
      issues. <br>
      <br>
      Workers in stables saddle and unsaddle horses, give them rubdowns, and walk them through a
      cool-off after a ride. They also feed, groom, and exercise the horses, clean out stalls
      and replenish bedding, polish saddles, clean and organize the tack (harness, saddle, and
      bridle) room, and store supplies and feed. Experienced staff may help train horses.<br>
      <br>
      Animal caretakers in animal hospitals or clinics are called veterinary assistants.
      Veterinarians rely on caretakers to keep a constant eye on the condition of animals under
      their charge. Caretakers watch as animals recover from surgery, check whether dressings
      are still on correctly, observe the animals' overall attitude, and notify a doctor if
      anything seems out of the ordinary. While among the animals, caretakers clean constantly
      to maintain sanitary conditions in the hospital.<br>
      <br>
      Laboratory animal caretakers work in research facilities and assist with the care of a
      wide variety of animals, including mice, rats, sheep, pigs, cattle, dogs, cats, monkeys,
      birds, fish, and frogs. They feed and water the animals, clean cages and change bedding,
      and examine the animals for signs of illness, disease, or injury. They may administer
      medications orally or topically according to instructions, prepare samples for laboratory
      examination, sterilize laboratory equipment, and record information regarding genealogy,
      diet, weight, medications, and food intake. They work with scientists, physicians,
      veterinarians, and laboratory technicians.<br>
      <br>
      In zoos, caretakers called keepers prepare the diets and clean the enclosures of animals,
      and sometimes assist in raising their wards. They watch for any signs of illness or
      injury, monitor eating patterns or any changes in behavior, and record their observations.
      Keepers also may answer questions and assure that the visiting public behaves responsibly
      toward the exhibited animals. Depending on the zoo, keepers may be assigned to work with a
      broad group of animals such as mammals, birds, or reptiles, or they may work with a
      limited collection of animals such as primates, large cats, or small mammals. <a name="conditions"></a></p>

  <li><h4><a HREF="260.htm#cond">Working Conditions</a></h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>People who love animals get satisfaction from working with and helping animals.
      However, some of the work may be unpleasant and physically and emotionally demanding.
      Caretakers have to clean animal cages and lift, hold, or restrain animals, risking
      exposure to bites or scratches. Their work often involves kneeling, crawling, repeated
      bending, and lifting heavy supplies like bales of hay or bags of feed. Animal caretakers
      must take precautions when treating animals with germicides or insecticides. The work
      setting can be noisy. Animal caretakers who witness abused animals or assist in the
      euthanizing of unwanted, aged, or hopelessly injured animals may experience emotional
      stress.<br>
      <br>
      Caretakers may work outdoors in all kinds of weather. Hours are irregular. Animals have to
      be fed every day, so caretakers must work weekend and holiday shifts. In some animal
      hospitals, research facilities, and animal shelters an attendant is on duty 24 hours a
      day, which means night shifts. Most full-time caretakers work about 40 hours a week; some
      work 50 hours a week or more. Caretakers of show and sports animals travel to
      competitions. <a name="employment"></a></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><h4><a HREF="260.htm#emply">Employment</a></h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Animal caretakers held about 163,000 jobs in 1996. About 33,000 of the total worked as
      veterinary assistants in veterinary services. The remainder worked primarily in boarding
      kennels, but also in animal shelters, stables, grooming shops, zoos, and local, State, and
      Federal agencies. In 1996, 2 out of every 10 caretakers was self-employed, and 4 in 10
      worked part time. <a name="training"></a></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><h4><a HREF="260.htm#training">Training, Other Qualifications, and Advancement</a></h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Most animal caretakers are trained on the job. Employers generally prefer to hire
      people with some experience with animals. Some training programs are available for
      specific types of animal caretakers, but formal training is usually not necessary for
      entry-level positions. <br>
      <br>
      Most pet groomers learn their trade by completing an informal apprenticeship, usually
      lasting 6 to 10 weeks, under the guidance of an experienced groomer. Prospective groomers
      may also attend one of the 50 State-licensed grooming schools throughout the country, with
      programs varying in length from 4 to 18 weeks. The National Dog Groomers Association of
      America certifies groomers who pass a written and practical skills examination. Beginning
      groomers often start by taking on one duty, such as bathing and drying the pet. They
      eventually assume responsibility for the entire grooming process, from the initial
      brush-out to the final clipping. Groomers who work in large retail establishments or
      kennels may, with experience, move into supervisory or managerial positions. Experienced
      groomers often choose to open their own shops.<br>
      <br>
      Beginning animal caretakers in kennels learn on the job, and usually start by cleaning
      cages and feeding and watering animals. Kennel caretakers may be promoted to kennel
      supervisor, assistant manager, and manager, and those with enough capital and experience
      may open up their own kennels. The American Boarding Kennels Association (ABKA) offers a
      3-stage, home-study program for individuals interested in pet care. The first two study
      programs address basic and advanced principles of animal care, while the third program
      focuses on in-depth animal care and good business procedures. Those who complete the third
      program and pass oral and written examinations administered by the ABKA become Certified
      Kennel Operators (CKO). <br>
      <br>
      There are no formal educational requirements for animal caretakers in veterinary
      facilities. They are trained on the job, usually under the guidance of a veterinarian or
      veterinary technician. They start by performing tasks related to basic animal health care,
      such as keeping cages and examination areas sanitary. They also help veterinarians prepare
      for surgery, sterilize surgical equipment, observe recovering animals, and give
      medications and basic medical treatment under the directions of a veterinarian or
      veterinary technician. Highly motivated veterinary assistants may become veterinary
      technicians, with additional training from one of approximately 65 accredited veterinary
      technology programs.<br>
      <br>
      Employers of entry-level laboratory animal caretakers generally require a high school
      diploma or General Educational Development (GED) test. A few colleges and vocational
      schools offer programs in laboratory animal science which provide training for technician
      positions, but such training is not strictly necessary. New animal caretakers working in
      laboratories begin by providing basic care to laboratory animals. With additional training
      and experience, they may advance to more technical positions in laboratory animal care,
      such as research assistant, mid-level technician, or senior-level technologist. The
      American Association for Laboratory Animal Science (AALAS) offers certification for three
      levels of technician competence. Those who wish to become certified as Assistant
      Laboratory Animal Technicians (ALAT) must satisfy education and experience requirements
      before taking an examination administered by AALAS. <br>
      <br>
      Some zoological parks may require their caretakers to have a bachelor's degree in biology,
      animal science, or a related field. Most require experience with animals, preferably as a
      volunteer or paid keeper in a zoo. Zoo keepers may advance to senior keeper, assistant
      head keeper, head keeper, and assistant curator, but few openings occur, especially for
      the higher-level positions.<br>
      <br>
      Animal caretakers in animal shelters are not required to have any specialized training,
      but training programs and workshops are increasingly available through the Humane Society
      of the United States and the National Animal Control Association. Workshop topics include
      cruelty investigations, appropriate methods of euthanasia for shelter animals, and
      techniques for preventing problems with wildlife. With experience and additional training,
      caretakers in animal shelters may become an adoption coordinator, animal control officer,
      emergency rescue driver, assistant shelter manager, or shelter director. <a name="outlook"></a></p>

  </li>
  <li><h4><a HREF="260.htm#outlook">Job Outlook</a></h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Employment opportunities for animal caretakers generally are expected to be good. The
      outlook for caretakers in zoos, however, is not favorable; jobseekers will face keen
      competition because of expected slow growth in zoo capacity, low turnover, and the fact
      that the occupation attracts many candidates.<br>
      <br>
      Employment is expected to grow <a HREF="261.htm">faster than the average</a> for
      all occupations through the year 2006. The growth of the pet population, which drives
      employment of animal caretakers in kennels, grooming shops, animal shelters, and
      veterinary clinics and hospitals, is expected to slow. Nevertheless, pets remain popular
      and pet owners&#151;including a large number of baby boomers whose disposable income is
      expected to increase as they age&#151;may increasingly take advantage of grooming
      services, daily and overnight boarding services, and veterinary services, spurring
      employment growth for animal caretakers and veterinary assistants. Demand for animal
      caretakers in animal shelters is expected to remain steady. Communities are increasingly
      recognizing the connection between animal abuse and abuse toward humans, and should
      continue to commit funds to animal shelters, many of which are working hand-in-hand with
      social service agencies and law enforcement teams. <br>
      <br>
      Despite growth in demand for animal caretakers, the overwhelming majority of jobs will
      result from the need to replace workers leaving the field. Many animal caretaker jobs that
      require little or no training have work schedules which tend to be flexible; therefore, it
      is ideal for people seeking their first job and for students and others looking for
      temporary or part-time work. Because turnover is quite high, largely due to the hard
      physical labor, the overall availability of jobs should be very good. Much of the work of
      animal caretakers is seasonal, particularly during vacation periods. <a name="earnings"></a></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li><h4><a HREF="260.htm#earnings">Earnings</a></h4>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Animal caretakers who worked full time earned a median weekly salary of $290 in 1996.
      The middle 50 percent earned between $220 and $380. The bottom 10 percent earned less than
      $170; the top 10 percent earned more than $500 a week. According to a salary survey by the
      National Animal Control Association, nonsupervisory animal caretakers working in animal
      care and control agencies earned a yearly average of about $17,100 in 1996. <a name="related"></a></p>
