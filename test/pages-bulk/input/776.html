When one thermostatcontrols the temperature for an entire house, it produces predictable resultsthat pit husband against wife and basement playroom against upstairs officein "<B>The Battle of the Thermostat</B>".&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT><P><IMG SRC="images/misc/gclogo_sm.gif" ALT="Good Cents" HEIGHT=60 WIDTH=102 ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>Thewar begins when dad turns the thermostat down because the family room istoo warm. A few minutes later mom turns up the thermostat because the bedroomis too cold. Eventually, someone is opening a window or closing a ventto get the temperature just right, and no one is really comfortable. Butthere's a better solution than family feuds or dressing in layers.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Zoned heating and cooling systemsallow you to control the temperature of each room individually.</B> Byusing a series of motorized dampers and thermostats that work independently,zoning can eliminate hot or cold rooms found in almost every home, whilecutting energy by up to 25 percent, according to Anne Drake, a spokeswomanfor Honeywell's zone control systems.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><UL><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>"<B>People like to save energy</B>,but they don't like to sacrifice comfort," said Drake. "Energy savingsused to be the key thing in people's minds when it came to air conditioningand heating, now <B>comfort is also a major consideration</B>. When yousit down and explain to people what zoning does from a cost efficiencystandpoint, you are basically them comfort in their home."</FONT></FONT></UL><IMG SRC="images/misc/zoning_il.gif" ALT="Zoning Illustration" HEIGHT=186 WIDTH=396 ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>Simplelaws of physics illustrate why it is virtually <B>impossible to keep anentire house at a consistent temperature</B> without zoning. Warm air riseswhile cold air sinks, leaving upstairs rooms six to ten degrees warmerand basements six to ten degrees cooler than ground level rooms. A singlethermostat keeps the temperature balanced in the room where it is located,but can't tell if the temperature has changed in other rooms of the house.Zoning helps maintain a consistent temperature throughout the house byproviding different levels of air distribution to different areas of thehome.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Zone controlled systems divide ahome into areas with common heating and cooling needs during specific partsof the day.</B> Air flow is controlled in each area by a separate thermostat.Instead of sending the same amount of heated or cooled air into all roomevery time the furnace or air conditioner is turned on, the system sendsconditioned air only to the zones that need it. Temperaturs can be keptat an ideal comfort level when the family is up and about, then changedto an energy-saving temperature overnight or when the family is away.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>For example, in a typical two-storyhouse, the main floor with the living room, kitchen and dining area, isusually occupied during the evenings. Bedrooms are occupied mostly at nightand in the early morning. <B>With zoning, you can cool or heat one areaof the house at a time.</B> You can also select different temperature settingsfor each zone of the house. In most homes, a two or three zone system issufficient. Rarely does a home equire more than three zones.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>Most homes can be zoned <B>accordingto room occupancy</B>, but unique exposure factors may require a differentzoning strategy. A room with large amounts of glass facing south or westwill have more heat gain than other rooms in the home. A separate zonemight be required for that room alone!&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>At an average price of $1,200, zonecontrol systems provide a cost efficient alternative to dual air systemsthat require separate air conditioners and furnaces for different areasof the house, according to Ron Reinhardt of Research Products Corporation."It justs makes sense. You become more comfortable in your home, and yousave money."&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Zone control is especially effectivein homes that have multiple levels, spawling designs, large glass windows,or large open areas such as an atrium or solarium</B>. Existing homes withfinished basements, attic spaces and additions are also good candidatesfor zoning. Almost all forced air systems can be converted for zone control,according to Reinhardt. "A control panel, thermostats, dampers and theproper duct work are all it takes."&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>Builders are still learning about zonecontrol systems, even though HVAC contractors have been installing themfor the last five years or more. Zoning is still be introduced in someregions of the United States and has been well received by the home-buyingpublic.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><UL><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>"Almost every time I sat down to writecontract with a home buyer, the first thing they wanted added to theirhome was zone heating and air conditioning," said Dennis Belk, a divisionmanager for Dobson Builders in Greenville, South Carolina. Dobson has madezoned controlled heating and air a standard feature in homes priced over$120,000.</FONT></FONT></UL><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>While still in it's infancy, zoning isto heating and cooling what the light switch is to lighting. Virtuallyall homes come equipped with more than one light switch, and one day soon,homes may come with more than one thermostat.&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><CENTER><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>Sharon Ray is a freelance writerbased in Atlanta, Ga.</FONT></FONT></I></CENTER><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></FONT><P><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>Copyright &copy; 1996-99 Good CentsEnergy Services&nbsp;</FONT></FONT><BR><HR WIDTH="100%"></TD></TR><TR><TD><CENTER><B><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=-1><A HREF="Idea_Wk_Jour.html">UDAIdea Workshop Journal</A></FONT></FONT></B></CENTER><CENTER><HR WIDTH="100%"><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=-1>Thank you for your interestin UDA Ideal Home Plans<SUP>TM</SUP>.
