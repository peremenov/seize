        In the event of any discrepancy between the policy and provisions stated 
        herein and the official documents, statutes and administrative rules governing

        the participation of insurance eligible employees in the Uniform Group 
        Insurance Program and TexFlex that are administered by the Employees Retirement 
        System of Texas. The University Human Resources Department and ERS are

      <p>The following programs are available on an optional basis:<br>
        (For specific information regarding plan options, coverage schedules,

          hospital services, physician's or surgeon's services, nursing care, 
          x-ray, and laboratory exams, and other medical expense benefits for 
          employees and eligible dependents. Insurance eligible regular faculty 
          and staff are required to be covered by the employee only basic health 
          plan (HealthSelect of Texas), unless coverage is waived or another option 
          is chosen.</p>

          (AD&amp;D): Employees who participate in the basic health plan or in 
          an HMO are also provided with $5,000 basic term life insurance and $5,000 
          basic AD&amp;D coverage. </p>
        <p><strong>4.3</strong> Optional Coverages: Upon enrollment in the Uniform 
          Group Insurance Program basic health plan (either HealthSelect or an 
          HMO), employees may during their initial period of eligibility (first 
          31 days of employment) enroll in any of the following optional coverages:</p>
        <p><strong>4.3.1</strong> Optional Term Life With AD&amp;D Life: Coverage 
          (for the employee) is available in an amount equal to one (1) or two

          to three (3) or four (4) times annual salary is available only after 
          satisfying evidence of insurability. The maximum amount of Optional 
          Term Life Insurance may not exceed $400,000.</p>
        <p><strong>4.3.2</strong> Voluntary Accidental Death and Dismemberment 
          (AD&amp;D) Plan: Voluntary accidental death and dismemberment coverage 
          is available for the employee and/or eligible dependents in an amount 
          of $10,000 to $200,000 in increments of $5,000. (See current schedule

          elect to participate in short term disability, long term disability 
          or both short and long term disability coverage. (See current schedule 
          of benefits for details of coverage.)</p>
        <p><strong>4.3.5 </strong>Dental Coverage: Eligible employees may elect 
          coverage for themselves and eligible dependents in either a dental indemnity 
          plan or in a dental maintenance plan. The dental indemnity plan allows 
          the participant freedom to select care from any dentist while the dental 
          maintenance plan offers benefits with specific providers. (See schedules 
          of benefits for details.)</p>
        <p><strong>4.3.6</strong> Premium Conversion: Premium conversion enables 
          employees to pay for out-of-pocket premiums for health, dental, life, 
          and AD&amp;D, with tax-free dollars. Premium conversion for dependent 
          life coverage is not allowed by IRS regulations. Disability premiums 
          are also not tax-deferred to allow for tax-free benefits.</p>
        <p><strong>4.4</strong> TexFlex Programs: Participants in the Uniform 
          Group Insurance Program may participate in the flexible benefits program 
          called TexFlex. TexFlex allows employees to pay for eligible health 
          care and day care expenses with tax-free dollars. The following programs

          and eligible dependents. </p>
        <p><strong>4.4.2</strong> Dependent Care Reimbursement Account: A Dependent 
          Care Reimbursement Account (DCRA) enables employees to pay for dependent 
          care expenses for children under age 13 or for elderly or disabled dependents 
          with tax-free dollars. </p>
        <p><strong>4.5</strong> Long Term Care Insurance: All insurance-eligible 
          employees may enroll in group long term care insurance coverage for 
          themselves and their spouses without evidence of insurability during 
          the employee's initial 31 days of employment. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>5. Enrollment Eligibility &#8211; Health and Basic Life:</strong></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><strong>5.1</strong> A new full-time insurance-eligible faculty or 
          staff member is required to be covered by the &quot;employee only&quot; 
          basic health and term life plan the first of the month following their 
          initial ninety (90) day waiting period unless coverage is waived, except 
          for new faculty and staff hired on September 1, 2003. New faculty and 
          staff hired on or before September 1, 2003, will be eligible for coverage 
          effective September 1 without an initial 90-day waiting period. The 
          University will provide the employer contribution from local (non-appropriated 
          funds) for those hired on September 1 to the first of the month following 
          their initial ninety (90) day waiting period. New insurance-eligible 
          faculty and staff members hired after September 1, 2003 will be subject 
          to the ninety (90) day waiting period. </p>
        <p><strong>5.2</strong> A new part-time insurance eligible employee beginning 
          September 1, 2003 or later will automatically have coverage waived. 
          The employee will have an initial eligibility period to enroll in basic 
          health and term life coverage. The intial eligibility period will begin 
          on the employees hire date and will last until the first of the month 
          following a 90-day waiting period.</p>
        <p><strong>5.3</strong> New insurance-eligible employees have an &quot;initial 
          period of eligibility&quot;. The eligibility period begins on their 
          first active duty date and ends on their health coverage date (ninety 
          plus days). During this initial eligibility period, employees may enroll 
          eligible dependents without evidence of insurability. Thereafter, evidence 
          of insurability will be required, and coverage is never guaranteed. 
          Additional restrictions on enrollment may be imposed by the Employees 
          Retirement System (ERS) and because of the tax break provided through 
          premium conversion.</p>
        <p><strong>5.4</strong> Newly acquired dependents (through marriage, birth, 
          or adoption) may be enrolled without evidence of insurability within 
          31 days of becoming eligible. </p>
        <p><strong>5.5</strong> After dropping coverage, evidence of insurability 
          must be provided by an employee, retiree, or dependent to re-enroll.</p>
        <p><strong>5.6</strong> Full-time employees (working 40 hours a week) 
          will receive a state contribution of 100 percent of the cost of the 
          employee basic health and term life coverage, and 50 percent of the 
          cost of dependent coverage. Part-time employees (working 20 or more 
          hours a week up to less than 40 hours a week) will receive a state contribution 
          of 50 percent of the cost of the employee basic health and term life 
          coverage, and 25 percent of the cost of dependent coverage. Insurance 
          eligible, part-time graduate students are eligible to receive an additional 
          employer contribution from local funds of the University up to the full 
          cost of the employee basic health and term life coverage, and 50 percent 
          of the dependent coverage. </p>
        <p><strong>5.7</strong> For new insurance eligible faculty and staff members 
          who start employment on September 1, 2003 the University will provide 
          the employer contribution from local (non-appropriated) funds for the 
          months from their hire date, September 1, 2003, to the first of the 
          month following ninety (90) days of employment. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>6. Enrollment Eligibility - Optional Coverage and TexFlex: </strong></p>
      <p>New insurance-eligible employees may enroll in Optional Life, Dependent 
        Life, Disability, and Dental optional coverage and TexFlex within thirty-one 
        (31) days of employment. Thereafter, application for coverage may be made 
        only with evidence of insurability. ERS administrative rules restrict 
        application with evidence of insurability for these coverages to the annual 
        Summer Enrollment Period unless an eligible Qualifying Life Event has 
        occurred. Voluntary AD&amp;D does not require evidence of insurability, 
        but election of Voluntary AD&amp;D after an employee's first thirty-one 
        (31) days is limited to the Summer Enrollment period unless an eligible 
        Qualifying Life Event occurs. </p>
      <p>Application with evidence of insurability for the University&#8217;s 
        Long Term Care insurance may be made at any time during the plan year. 
        Employees may apply for ERS&#8217;s Long Term Care program during summer 
        enrollment. Employees may enroll in dental coverage during their initial 
        31 days of eligibility or during the annual Summer Enrollment period.</p>
      <p><strong>7. Making changes to Insurance or Tex Flex coverage: </strong></p>
      <p>Outside of the employee's first 31 days of employment, coverage changes 
        can only be made during the annual Summer Enrollment period. If an employee 
        has an eligible Qualifying Life Event as defined by ERS, the employee 
        may be able to make certain changes during the plan year, provided the 
        applicable form is completed in Human Resources within 31 days of the 
        event. </p>
      <p><strong>8. Employment for Less than Twelve (12) Months/Leaves of Absence: 
        </strong></p>
      <p>All individuals employed less than 12 months are expected to arrange advance payments for all insurance programs with the Human Resources Department for the summer months. Employees who are on leave of absence, or who are not on the payroll for any month, are required to make advance payment. </p>
      <p>Employees on approved leave without pay can maintain UGIP coverage for 
        a maximum period of 12 continuous calendar months for any reason. An additional 
        12 months (for a total of 24 months) may be allowed for those on Leave 
        Without Pay for educational purposes as certified by the institution. 
        Employees who are on leave without pay, except for the purpose of Family 
        and Medical Leave without pay, are not eligible to receive the state insurance 
        contribution.</p>
      <p>Individuals employed prior to 9/1/01 with nine-month appointments may 
        elect to receive their nine-month salary over a period of 12 months by 
        electing the 9/12 Pay Option on the Payroll Options form prior to August 
        31 of any fiscal year thereby ensuring that premiums are deducted during 
        the summer months. </p>
      <p>Individuals with nine month appointments must assure payment of summer insurance premiums. These employees must elect to receive their nine month salary over a period of 12 months by electing the 9/12 Pay Option, or pre-pay summer insurance premiums by electing the 12 over 9 Premium Reserve Option. If 9/12/ pay is not elected, Premium Reserve enrollment is mandatory. </p>
      <p><strong>9. Insurance Programs for Reservists/Employees Called to Active 
      Duty: </strong> </p>
      <p>Reservists/employees called to active duty may continue insurance coverage 
        during their military leave of absence without pay for up to 12 months. 
        See Extended Military Leave Policy No. 1.4.9. (Disability insurance is 
        suspended while on leave of absence without pay.) Reservists/Employees 
        are not eligible to receive the monthly state insurance contribution while 
        on leave when the leave encompasses the month. To continue coverage the 
        reservist/employee must pay the total monthly premium.</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><strong>9.1</strong> Reservists/Employees called to active duty may 
          drop coverage on themselves and/or their dependents while on leave of 
          absence. The reservist/employee may reinstate all insurance coverages 
          that were in effect immediately prior to the commencement of the active 
          duty without evidence of insurability and/or pre-existing conditions 
          or limitations, provided the reservist/employee returns to work within 
          90 days of discharge and reinstates coverages within 30 days from the 
          date the reservist/employee returns to work. </p>
        <p><strong>9.2 </strong>Covered dependents of the Reservists/Employees 
          who drop coverage while on a leave of absence may apply for continuation 
          of coverage for up to 12 months under the provisions of COBRA. Dependent 
          coverage may be reinstated as indicated in 8.1. when the reservist/employee 
          returns to work.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>10. Insurance Programs for Retirees: </strong></p>
      <p>Upon retirement from the University, a regular faculty or staff member 
        may be eligible to continue membership in the Uniform Group Insurance 
        Program (UGIP) for Retirees. Eligible retirees may enroll in health, basic 
        life, optional life, dependent life, and dental coverage by completing 
        the appropriate TRS/ORP Retiree Enrollment Form within 31 days of retirement 
        eligibility. To be eligible for retiree insurance an individual must be 
        at least 65 years of age and have a minimum of ten years of creditable 
        service with the Teacher Retirement System (TRS) or equivalent service 
        in the Texas Optional Retirement Program (ORP) or qualify for retirement 
        benefits based on age plus years of service totaling 80 or more, and must 
        be eligible to receive a retirement annuity from either TRS or ORP. In 
        addition, a minimum number of years of UGIP participation is required: 
        3 years if hired before September 1, 2001 or 10 years if hired September 
        1, 2001 or later. Retirees may continue dependent life and optional life 
        coverage within limits established by the Employees Retirement System.</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><strong>10.1</strong> Once enrolled in the retiree insurance program, 
          the retiree's coverage is administered by the Employees Retirement System 
          of Texas.</p>
        <p><strong>10.2</strong> The State of Texas contributes each month toward 
          the cost (premium) of each regular retired faculty or staff member's 
          group medical insurance program. The amount is set by state law.</p>
        <p><strong>10.3</strong> Employees who become disabled may be eligible 
          for continued coverage in accordance with the rules and regulations 
          of the Employees Retirement System of Texas.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>11. Insurance Coverage Continuation:</strong></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><strong>11.1</strong> A surviving spouse and/or dependents who are 
          covered by the group at the time of the death of a retiree or an employee 
          who meets the eligibility criteria for retiree insurance may, at their 
          option, continue such coverage indefinitely, subject to continued payment 
          of group premiums for the surviving spouse and/or dependents. Upon leaving 
          the group, the spouse and/or dependents have the right to convert to 
          an individual policy without evidence of insurability, if applied for 
          within 31 days of termination of group status.</p>
        <p><strong>11.2</strong> Under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation 
          Act (COBRA) of 1986 the University offers a continuation option for 
          certain employees and their dependents whose coverage under the group 
          medical plan program would otherwise end. This continuation option is 
          available to persons whose coverage would end on or after October 1, 
          1986.</p>
        <p><strong>11.2.1</strong> Employees and/or their dependents may elect 
          an 18-month continuation if terminating employment (except for gross 
          misconduct) or if reducing the number of hours worked would result in 
          a loss of coverage.</p>
        <p><strong>11.2.2</strong> For the purposes of continuation of coverage 
          under COBRA, gross misconduct is defined as, but not limited to, the 
          following: </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p><strong>a.</strong> Theft, misappropriation of unauthorized use of 
            University funds or property.</p>

            on University premises.</p>
          <p><strong>c.</strong> Assault of a University employee or student.</p>
          <p><strong>d.</strong> Conviction of a felony or conviction of a misdemeanor 
            involving moral turpitude.</p>
          <p> <strong>e.</strong> Sexual harassment. </p>
          <p><strong>f.</strong> Bringing liquor, marijuana, or narcotics onto 
            the University campus; or consuming liquor or using marijuana or narcotics 
            on University premises.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>11.2.3</strong> <strong>Dependents may elect a 36-month continuation 
          if:</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>a.</strong> Coverage would otherwise end because of the death 
            or divorce or legal separation from the covered employee;</p>
          <p><strong>b.</strong> A dependent child would lose coverage due to 
            plan provisions (for example, reaching a maximum age or due to marriage); 
            or</p>
          <p><strong>c.</strong> If coverage would end due to the employee reaching 
            Medicare eligibility.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>11.3 </strong>In the case of 10.1 or 10.2 the surviving spouse 
        or dependents of COBRA continuations are not eligible for premium sharing 
        contributions.</p>
