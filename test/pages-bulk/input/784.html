<p align="right"><i>&#151;G. Morgan Watkins, Departmental Services</i> 
<p>Back in the spring of 1988, computer security was largely a matter of &quot;Make 
  sure you lock the computer room door when you're done.&quot; Then a few rogue 
  programs called &quot;viruses&quot; began to appear on the West Coast, spreading 
  and replicating undercover from one computer to another and reaching the University 
  several months later. First was the &quot;Pakistani Brain&quot; virus that struck 
  UT Windows computers late that summer. Then the &quot;Scores&quot; virus attacked 
  Macintoshes across campus, leaving many machines unusable for days. 
<p>In these two cases, UT had time to prepare a defense because the Internet highway 
  was still largely under construction, and viruses spread mostly via shared diskettes. 
  But despite early warnings, UT was still hit hard when the outbreak took place: 
  significant service interruptions occurred, it wasn't easy to stop, there were 
  no virus protection packages, and people didn't take the threat seriously.

<p>Today, we have campus licenses for antivirus software, but we also have thousands 
  of computer viruses skulking worldwide. Unfortunately, people still don't take 
  the threat seriously enoughand the stakes are much higher. With millions of 
  business-critical computers linked to the Internet, a particularly malignant 
  virus could seriously damage the global economy in a single electronic blitzkrieg. 
<p>The latest major attack came on May 5, when the &quot;Love Bug&quot; infected 
  Microsoft Outlook mail services and mailboxes across the world. Thousands of 
  infected e-mail messages were generated on campus, spreading a potential disaster 
  throughout the UT community. 
<p>Although Asia and Europe had already been struck by the Love Bug during the 
  night, there were no official alerts to warn Americans. Even so, ACITS and many 
  departmental computer administrators reacted immediately. Within minutes, ACITS 
  personnel were phoning administrative and departmental contacts across campus, 
  letting them know of the attack. Since e-mail might be seen only after it was 
  too late, other staff posted signs in buildings and knocked on office doors. 
  Some departments shut down their servers; others isolated their local networks; 
  others braved out the attack but carefully reviewed their e-mail and refused 
  to open any attachments. Throughout the blitz, ACITS' central services remained 
  available while technical staff were busy stopping the influx of contaminated 
  attachments. The Help Desk was on hand to assist, and UT's home page posted 
  a prominent alert, directing people to useful information. Shortly after noon, 
  seminars were given on how to eradicate the Love Bug. A special team remained 
  on campus until late that night to help anyone who needed hands-on assistance. 
  Campus-wide recovery efforts went well. In part it was the skills of dedicated 
  staff across campus; in part it was luck. 
<p>Fortunately, the Love Bug was rather innocuous, its destructive power mostly 
  limited to throwing away multimedia files and leaving droppings throughout system 
  folders. It did not trash hard disks, and it was relatively easy to recognize. 
  The Love Bug was not a terrorist act. But the next strike could well be. 
<h3><font color="#1874cd">For IT Managers: Be Prepared</font> </h3>
<p>We hope that computer users are finally aware of how vulnerable their electronic 
  assets really are. In less than 24 hours, a poorly designed and simple piece 
  of code caused $20 billion in damages. We must assume that virus creators are 
  also aware of the destructive power now at their fingertips. To protect the 
  University, we need better communication, organization, and preparation. The 
  comments and suggestions below are directed to IT managers on campus. 
<p>Even careful planning won't give perfect security against attacksthere will 
  always be holes in our defenses. The key to surviving an electronic incursion 
  is to expect it. This includes planning ahead, reacting quickly, notifying the 
  right people, finding solutions, and cleaning up the mess. Afterwards, a post-mortem 
  should be done to learn how to react better the next time. 
<p>Generally, your most precious computer asset is your data, and anything you 
  can do before hand to protect it could save you later. Keep your computers' 
  operating systems and antivirus solutions up-to-date, and, above all, have reliable, 
  daily backups using expertly managed servers. Making users responsible for system 
  updates and backups is a poor solution. Keeping data on servers makes it easier 
  to retrieve data from backups. 
<h3><font color="#1874cd">Have a Plan . . . </font></h3>
<p>Know the location of all your departmental computing resources. If the department 
  has desktop management procedures, that is, specific hardware, operating systems, 
  and application suites that all members of a particular group use, it is much 
  easier to recover from a disaster. If user data is stored on file servers and 
  if standard system images are maintained, the road to normal operations is shorter. 
  And this is true whether the incident is a virus attack, a fire, flood, or theft. 
<p>In the event of a security incident, such as a destructive virus, reaction 
  time is crucial. Before it happens, organize an Emergency Response Team (ERT). 
  You'll need an Incident Response Coordinator (IRC), a Communications Coordinator 
  (CC), and an Incident Technical Leader (ITL). Depending on the size of your 
  organization, you may need others to help make sure all the work gets done. 
  The IRC coordinates the actions of the team and takes responsibility for decisions. 
  The CC spreads the word and becomes the sole point of contact for the press. 
  The ITL gathers necessary technical information, puts together solutions, and 
  makes sure that the problem is cleaned up. Finally, members of the ERT must 
  be trained and must have materials to help them deal with unexpected problems. 
<h3><font color="#1874cd">Get in Touch . . . </font></h3>
<p>An ERT requires a communications plan. Who needs to be contacted if a virus 
  or other attack is detected? The plan should have names, phone numbers, and 
  the reason for calling each person or unit. There will be no time to work through 
  the telephone book trying to hunt down phone numbers. Be sure ACITS is on the 
  list. We can share information with departments and users and help assess the 
  extent of the damage. Also, a current paper inventory listing of hardware and 
  software assets, stored in a prearranged, secure location, could be essential 
  during a severe attack. 
<p>An ERT checklist of steps to be taken and a set of forms to document work is 
  also essential. One or more members of an ERT might not be available when a 
  problem happens, and someone else may need to fill the role. Other items, such 
  as preprinted instructions and signs for hallways should also be created and 
  stored. Periodic disaster drills will keep the procedures fresh. An ERT is of 
  little use if its members cannot be found. Departments should have emergency 
  procedures posted in a central location to make it easy to find responsible 
  parties at any time. Even if someone has agreed to wear a pager, there should 
  be alternate contacts. 
<h3><font color="#1874cd">Diagnose the Problem . . . </font></h3>
<p>Don't try to diagnose a security incident alone. Gather what information you 
  can, but check with the Help Desk and other support sites, as well as within 
  your college, to make sure you have all the facts. If the Internet is still 
  accessible, check the UT home page to see if anything has been posted. Other 
  excellent sites that track these kinds of problems include: 
<p>The National Infrastructure 
<blockquote> 
  <p>Protection Center: <b><a href="http://www.nipc.gov"> www.nipc.gov</a></b><br>
    The SANS Institute: <b> <a href="http://www.sans.org">www.sans.org</a></b><br>
    The CERT Coordination Center: <b><a href="http://www.cert.org">www.cert.org</a></b> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, check private vendors, such as 
<blockquote> 
  <p>Network Associates: <b><a href="http://www.nai.com"> www.nai.com</a></b><br>
    Symantec: <b> <a href="http://www.symantec.com">www.symantec.com</a></b><br>

  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may be prudent to disconnect an affected machine from the campus network, 
  but don't turn it off until you know what you're facing. Some viruses cause 
  further damage during the boot process. Obviously, be careful not to trigger 
  a virus on a system connected to the network or one that has useful information 
  on its hard drive. Some viruses can disrupt firmware severely enough to make 
  a system nearly unrecoverable. Moreover, avoid reading e-mail while logged in 
  with a privileged account on a workstation or server. Conceivably, you could 
  take down an entire facility by doing so. Finally, when you know what you've 
  found, share that information with ACITS so that a general alert can be sounded. 
<h3><font color="#1874cd">Notify, Isolate, and Protect . . . </font></h3>
<p>Getting the word out to your user community can be a problem during a cyber 
  attack. Sometimes, sending information by e-mail is ill-advised, and telephone 
  contact allows for immediate interchange. If people can't be reached by phone, 
  knock on doors and post signs in hallways and on office doors. The key is to 
  use all communications paths, depending on the severity of the incident. 
<p>If an attack is still underway, it may be prudent to disconnect your servers 
  from the network, and then to disconnect compromised systems. Keep track of 
  what machines have problems and mark them in some way so that others will know 
  the machine has not been properly restored. Paper signs taped over the monitor 
  screens are obvious indicators and will not fall off or be ignored. Affected 
  machines should not be used until they have been cleaned up.

<h3><font color="#1874cd">Assess Damage and Research Solutions . . . </font></h3>
<p>Once you know the scope of the problem, you'll need to begin planning your 
  recovery. Systems that affect several users will almost certainly need a higher 
  priority. Mobilize your Emergency Response Team to handle things methodically. 
  The Incident Technical Leader will need to watch developments and talk with 
  others facing the same problem. Reacting too quickly can actually make things 
  worse or complicate recovery. During the Love Bug incident, several different 
  ways to eradicate the virus were posted around the country, but not all of them 
  were effective. Even the antivirus programs from vendors offered less-than-perfect 
  solutions. 
<h3><font color="#1874cd">Clean Up and Do a Post-Mortem . . .</font></h3>
Keep affected systems offline until you have removed any compromised elements 
and can verify that the system has returned to normal. You may need to do fresh 
installs of the operating system and restore files from backup tapes. After that, 
your final task is to change all of your passwords and advise your network users 
to change their passwords. 
<p>Carefully review everything done during an incident, shortly after its resolution. 
  Many lessons can be learned by studying the way that things were handled. Watch 
  for announcements from ACITS of a general post-mortem so that others can learn 
  from different approaches. <br>
