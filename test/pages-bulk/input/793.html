      <b><font size="5">The History of Marriage Within the Church<br>
      as it Pertains to Gay Marriage</font></b><font size="2"><br>
      <br>
      </font><b><font size="2">By Wally Bryen</font></b></div>
    <p><font size="2">The subject of the recognition and blessing of the 
    marriages by those in homosexual relationships has been a hotly debated 
    topic in recent years. In a time of record deficit spending, the president 
    has stated that the government will spend 1.5 billion dollars on the 
    ‘defense of marriage’ to ensure that only heterosexual men and women will be 
    allowed to marry. The recent Massachusetts Supreme Court ruling that it is 
    unconstitutional to prevent homosexuals from participating in the rights and 
    responsibilities of marriage has caused a firestorm of protests by both 
    civil and church leaders. It is often said that beginning with Adam and Eve 
    God has ordained the institution of marriage as a holy rite. The marriage of 
    gays is thus seen as an attack on the sanctity of the institution of 
    marriage. Gay marriage has been described as a sacrilege undercutting the 
    very definition of marriage that has existed from the dawn of recorded 
    history. <br>
    <br>
    Looking closer at the Biblical and historical record shows us that ideas of 
    marriage have changed considerably over the millennia. Practices once deemed 
    perfectly acceptable are now considered to be abhorrent. The New Testament 
    can be seen at times to radically change the understanding of marriage 
    resulting in a much more empowered position for women in marriage, even as 
    at other times it seems to firmly place women under the subjection of men. 
    Can it be that marriage is not the monolithic entity it is so often 
    purported to be in the rhetoric opposing gay marriage? Perhaps there are 
    ways of faithfully looking at both scripture and the values held by the 
    church that leave open the possibility of the church affirming and blessing 
    gay marriages.<br>
    <br>
    Even though the Bible has been used as a source of the idea that marriage is 
    a sacred rite ordained by God from the beginning of history, there is 
    surprisingly little discussion in the Hebrew or New Testament scriptures 
    about what a marriage actually is. A search for the words ‘marriage’, 
    ‘marry’ or ‘wife’ in the Bible yield numerous verses. Yet virtually none of 
    these discusses exactly what a marriage is. One is hard pressed to find 
    verses containing anything resembling “the Lord says a marriage happens 
    when…” or “marriage is Gods way of…” or “the reason the Lord wants us to be 
    married is…”. There are cases where the emphasis is on making sure the 
    Israelites do not marry foreigners such as in Nehemiah 13:27 “Shall we then 
    listen to you and do all this great evil and act treacherously against our 
    God by marrying foreign women?”(All scripture references are New Revised 
    Standard Version unless otherwise noted.). There are also instances where a 
    marriage is seen as a way of forming alliances as in 2 Chronicles 18:1 “Now 
    Jehoshaphat had great riches and honor; and he made a marriage alliance with 
    Ahab”. Leviticus 18:18 instructs men that “you shall not take a woman as a 
    rival to her sister, uncovering her nakedness while her sister is still 
    alive.” Interestingly, the explicit reference to the prohibition on marrying 
    two sisters seems to imply that it would be acceptable to have more than one 
    wife as long as they were not related, a practice certainly frowned upon in 
    modern times. The majority of cases in scripture seem to simply assume that 
    marriage is a preexisting cultural entity and that the reader would 
    understand what a marriage is without further explanation. But just what was 
    this cultural entity in ancient times?<br>
    <br>
    In the vast majority of cases where it is discussed in the Hebrew scriptures 
    marriage is presented as a rather one-sided transaction. Daughters are 
    usually seen as objects ‘given’ in marriage by their fathers. Genesis 34:21 
    states “let us take their daughters in marriage, and let us give them our 
    daughters”. In I Kings 11:19 there is even an account of Pharaoh giving the 
    sister of his wife as a bride to Hadad. Often the husband is not even the 
    party negotiating for the bride, but the father of the husband, as in 2 
    Kings 14:9 “give your daughter to my son for a wife”. Seldom if ever is the 
    wife portrayed as having any decision-making power in the choice of a 
    husband, or even any input on the subject. Yamauch supports this view by 
    noting that in “ancient Mesopotamia marriages were arranged by parents…the 
    consent of the bride was not necessary”(Yamauch 1978, 241). There are few if 
    any references in the Bible to the minimum age of brides, but an indication 
    of likely minimum ages can be seen gleaned in noting that in ancient “Egypt 
    girls were married between the ages of twelve and fourteen” (Yamauch 1978, 
    242). Arranged marriages are certainly still prevalent in many cultures 
    across the globe. However, in the West particularly in the United States, 
    the idea of a woman as the property of her father and being forced to marry 
    against her will and become the property of her husband is now usually seen 
    as overly oppressive to the freedom of women. Furthermore, an attempt by a 
    grown man to marry what modern society calls a girl of twelve years old 
    would be seen now as a heinious act of pedophilia.<br>
    <br>
    There is usually very little mention of love in the romantic sense as a 
    basis for marriage in the Hebrew scriptures. When there is any mention of 
    love it is usually a matter of what the potential husband wants, with no 
    concern mentioned about the woman’s wishes. Such is the case in the Genesis 
    29 account of Jacob who loved Rachel, yet there is no mention of a 
    reciprocal love on the part of Rachel for Jacob. Later in the story, when 
    Rachel and her sister Leah are both married to Jacob, the sisters’ squabbles 
    are not over the love of Jacob, but over who will bear him sons and thus 
    inherit the wealth of Jacob. The inheritance of this wealth would thus 
    enable the son to care for the mother. Additionally, this account of 
    multiple wives is neither frowned upon within the story, nor is it the only 
    such case in the Bible. There is even an instance where God appears to bless 
    the union of a man with his maidservants, as in the story of Abimelech in 
    Genesis 20. In this story, after Abimelech returns Sarah to Abraham God 
    blesses him by healing his wife and maidservants so that they bear children. 
    While it doesn’t explicitly state the maidservants bore him children, it 
    strongly implies such. Sarah herself gives her own servant Hagar to Abraham 
    as a wife to bear him children. Sarah is even described as Abraham’s half 
    sister. While many modern societies might frown on these practices, they are 
    presented within these canonical scriptural stories with a matter-of-fact 
    nonchalance as if that is just the way things were done at the time.<br>
    <br>
    Men were seemingly seen as the source of life itself in marriage 
    relationships, as can be seen in Adam’s declaration in Genesis 4:1 that “I 
    have produced a man with the help of the Lord”. There is no mention of ‘we’ 
    made a man implying a partnership with Eve, or indeed even the knowledge of 
    the basic biological facts of procreation as we know them today. The event 
    is portrayed as a creative act between God and Adam, with Eve merely 
    providing a place for the child to grow. This focus on procreation had a 
    great deal to do with the inheritance of wealth. Wives were expected to bear 
    children for their husbands in large part so that the man would have an heir 
    to inherit his wealth. While “the right of a widow to inherit the property 
    of her deceased husband was generally recognized in the cultures of the 
    Ancient Near East” (Davies 1981, 138), such was not the case in ancient 
    Hebrew society. If a Hebrew wife had no male children then “the nearest 
    kinsmen of the husband would have succeeded to the estate”(Davies 1981, 
    138-9). This precarious situation of childless widows is likely a source of 
    the Bible’s emphasis on concern for widows and orphans. One possible 
    exception that allowed a woman with no sons to participate in her husband’s 
    estate was known as the Levirate marriage in which “the brothers of the 
    deceased had the responsibility of providing the widow with male 
    heirs”(Davies 1981, 139). The assumption seems to be that the male heirs 
    that inherited the husband’s estate would then be able to care for their 
    mother. Such an arrangement would be almost unthinkable today.<br>
    <br>
    The New Testament sometimes seems to reemphasize the Hebrew scriptures 
    subordinate status of the wife. In 1 Corinthians 11:3 Paul states that 
    “Christ is the head of every man, and the husband is the head of his wife”. 
    Throughout the New Testament Christ is referred to as out Lord and ruler. In 
    this context of Christ as our ruler, it would be easy to view these verses 
    in I Corinthians as laying out the natural order of humanity: Christ is the 
    ruler of men, and husbands are the rulers of wives. Indeed, church 
    leadership has often used these scriptures to defend just such a position. 
    Yet this passage is sandwiched between discussions of church liturgical and 
    eating practices with emphasis on the prevention of becoming a stumbling 
    block to new believers. It seems quite a bit out of place to throw in a few 
    verses about ‘the rightful place of women’ in the middle of these chapters. 
    Further, Paul is undoubtedly speaking to the prevailing cultural practices 
    when he says shortly thereafter in 11:14 “does not nature itself teach you 
    that if a man wears long hair, it is degrading to him?” The readers in 
    Corinth would see it as self-evident that a woman should have long hair, and 
    a man should have short hair. Yet many cultures do not hold that men should 
    have short hair. God even gave Samson a covenant of strength through his 
    long hair. It is entirely possible and probable that Paul’s assessment of 
    the husband as head of the wife reflected not an edit of the way things must 
    be, but a reflection of how things were at the time. We are then left with 
    the prospect of determining how we apply the overriding principles to our 
    culture today.<br>
    <br>
    Paul emphasizes the more egalitarian nature of life in Christ when he states 
    in Galatians 3:38 that “there is no longer Jew or Greek, there is no longer 
    slave or free, there is no longer male and female; for you are one in 
    Christ”. In Ephesians 5:31 Paul instructs each husband to “love his wife as 
    himself”. The modern Western notion of marriage as originating between two 
    people who love each other so much that they want to spend their lives 
    together can make a reading of Ephesians 5:33 seem to be merely a friendly 
    reminder to not fall out of love. This message of love toward wives came at 
    a time when wives were seen by the larger society as virtual chattel 
    property for the benefit of the husband. This notion of treating a wife with 
    a spirit of love instead of ownership can be seen as a very empowering 
    egalitarian message of the value and dignity of wives. <br>
    <br>
    The verses immediately prior to Ephesians 5:31 can also be seen to be a 
    reinterpretation of the passage so often quoted in order to show the divine 
    order of marriage as solely between man and woman. Genesis 2:24 reads 
    “Therefore a man leaves his father and mother and clings to his wife, and 
    they become one flesh”. He restates it not as a reflection of the natural 
    biological order of humanity as created in two genders. Here in Ephesians 
    5:29-32 his emphasis is on the unity in Christ: “for no one ever hates his 
    own body, but he nourishes and tenderly cares for it, just as Christ does 
    for the church, because we are members of his body. ‘For this reason a man 
    will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two will 
    become one flesh’”. This New Testament notion recasts marriage away from a 
    transaction of property and domination towards a relationship of mutual 
    respect and partnership.<br>
    <br>
    Even though the nature of marriage changes somewhat in the New Testament, it 
    is still not recorded in the scriptures as something that happens under the 
    authority of the church. Even in the Byzantine era marriage could be seen to 
    happen “through a blessing, or crowning, or a contract” (Viscuso 1991, 310). 
    This notion of blessing here “refers to betrothal” (Viscuso 1991, 310). This 
    betrothal was not fully a marriage, but the promise that such marriage would 
    take place. The betrothal differed from a mere verbal agreement, which would 
    have been considered an engagement, in the fact that a betrothal “was 
    brought about or celebrated through a sacred ‘blessing’…whose central 
    feature was a prayer…that the betrothal might be confirmed and made 
    indissoluble” (Viscuso 1991, 312). Eventually the church began to see 
    marriage as a sacrament imparting grace.<br>
    <br>
    During the Reformation “Protestant marriage theory began to take shape: the 
    legitimacy and significance of civil authority over the institution was 
    recognized; the sacramental status which the Roman Catholic Church accorded 
    the institution was removed” (Yates 1985, 41). Yates further notes that 
    “Martin Luther considered marriage an order of creation whose origin 
    transcended both church and state” (Yates, 1985 41). This thought by Luther 
    began the belief still held by most Protestants that marriage is an 
    institution ordained by God. During the Reformation, the character of 
    marriage began to be viewed as a covenant rather than a contract. This 
    covenant relationship thus mirrors the relationship between God and Israel 
    “to become partners in a relationship marked by trust, fidelity, steadfast 
    love, justice, and obedience to the will of God” (Yates 1985, 42).<br>
    <br>
    A recent editorial in Christianity Today noted that in modern times “the 
    increasing privatization of marriage has become almost absolute: neither the 
    community nor the paterfamilias (does such exist anymore?) has any say in 
    the formation or dissolution of a marriage. What was a community affair for 
    over 400 years has devolved into just one more exercise of personal choice” 
    (Editorial 2000, 40). This same article decries attempts to promote gay 
    marriages as a threat by “judicial activism and gay-rights activists working 
    together to empty marriage of its traditional meaning” (Editorial 2000, 40). 
    However, these representative arguments against gay marriages fail to 
    explain in any substance how allowing gay marriages would in any way change 
    the nature or understanding of heterosexual marriages. They fail to explain 
    how allowing same-sex couples “to become partners in a relationship marked 
    by trust, fidelity, steadfast love, justice, and obedience to the will of 
    God” (Yates 1985, 42) would prevent heterosexuals from access to those same 
    rights and responsibilities. Nor does it suggest how gay marriage would 
    remove such connotations from the institution of marriage as understood by 
    the church.<br>
    <br>
    Others have argued “that marriage and the family are valuable social 
    institutions, especially important for children, but that they need to be 
    newly understood in nonpatriarchal and egalitarian ways…marital love 
    reflects God's own triune relationality. Marriage is an opportunity to 
    experience the reality of the divine. Marriage is an opportunity to 
    experience the reality of the divine” (Wall 2000, 1120). A fresh 
    interpretation of the theology of marriage should thus “strive to liberate 
    children from the widespread and often unacknowledged suffering caused by 
    modernity’s culture of divorce” (Wall 2000, 1121). <br>
    <br>
    The traditional emphasis on procreation within marriage and the belief that 
    “the sacrament of marital love finds its further expression in parents’ love 
    for the fruits of their sexuality” (Wall 2000, 1120) might seem to exclude 
    homosexuals from the marriage rites, since homosexual acts can never produce 
    offspring. Yet the vast majority of current churches make no outcry of 
    damnation against childless couples, even if couples remain childless by 
    choice. The church sees married couples that participate in the possibility 
    of procreation by adoption or artificial insemination as equally valid 
    parents to those who have their own biological children. Childless couples 
    are still seen to embody this procreative possibility of their marriage by 
    being involved in the support of other people’s children, or even in the 
    support of the communities that foster the development of future 
    generations. The church has failed to adequately explain how childless 
    homosexual couples should not be allowed to marry on the basis of 
    infertility, when the same rules do not apply to heterosexuals. Nor do they 
    explain how homosexuals who become parents via adoption or other means would 
    be incapable of participating in the procreative nature of marriage. <br>
    <br>
    It should be noted that even the most steadfast opponents to gay marriage on 
    the grounds that marriage is a holy sacrament allow that there is a civil 
    component of marriage that is separate from the constraints of church 
    doctrine. Many clergy refuse to marry couples unless both parties are 
    committed Christians. The Catholic Church refuses to recognize a second 
    marriage of someone who has divorced his or her first spouse. Some churches 
    refuse to include marriage vows calling for the wife to ‘obey’ her husband, 
    yet other churches consider this vow a fundamental component of the 
    ceremony. Yet none of these churches fight to make these restrictions and 
    requirements part of the common law of the land. Allowing the state to 
    sanction gay marriages would still leave individual churches the freedom to 
    refuse to perform gay marriages on the basis of their own beliefs.<br>
    <br>
    Many of the proponents of gay marriage in the current political sphere argue 
    from the basis of civil rights. They argue that homosexuals should have the 
    same right to marriage that heterosexuals do. This may be the case, but 
    perhaps this argument is incomplete, and does not fully counter the 
    arguments against gay marriage as an attack on the ‘sanctity of marriage’. 
    Perhaps the church needs to be a prophetic voice that calls for a deeper 
    commitment by all people, heterosexual or otherwise, to the spiritual 
    aspects of marriage. The church can and should support and nurture marriages 
    based on Christian principals of love, trust, honesty, commitment and faith 
    in God. The church should be the institution leading society to a more just 
    understanding that the promotion of Christ-centered marriages does not have 
    to exclude homosexuals from the equation. Indeed, the very existence of 
    committed Christian, monogamous, married homosexual couples within the 
    community can nurture the next generation of homosexual youth. Married gay 
    couples within the church can affirm to young people that it is possible to 
    be who and what God made them to be, and still be in deep communion with God 
    and with community. It can also provide the next generation with a model for 
    moral, Godly homosexual behavior.</font><br>
