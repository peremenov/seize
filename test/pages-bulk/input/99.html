<pre>Is there any chance of us getting something like this going to support our Debian 
development efforts?

What do you think of Hans' ideas?

</strong></address>
  <p>


<h1>The Viability of Free Software Business Models</h1>

<author>by Hans Reiser</author>
<address>reiser@namesys.com</address>

<H1>Service Contracts</H1>

<P>Making your software free might DECREASE your service contracts
revenue.

<P>The free software movement is quick to cite service contracts as the
best way to make money from selling free software.  There is a problem
with that.

<p>Companies are quicker to spend money on service contracts for
proprietary software.

<p>The typical Linux software using company will have service contracts
on its Sun workstations including the software, and a hardware only
service contract on its Linux workstatons.  It will have service
contracts on Network Appliance fileservers, and, well, there is
exactly one company (Lycos-Europe) with a large service contract on
its ReiserFS fileservers.

<p>If a Linux using company does have service contracts on its Linux
workstations/appliances, most of the time that money goes to some
intermediary company which doesn't give any of the money to the
authors of the software being serviced.

<p>This is not rational economic behavior.  The authors of the software
will indeed give much more expert advice than anyone else.  They will
probably give it cheaper also.  It makes no economic sense whatsoever
to be slower to buy a service contract on free software than on
proprietary software if you use the free software.

<p>It is very real behavior though, and it is killing off many free
software companies.  Sourceforge went proprietary because their sales
people couldn't sell service contracts for free software, and making
the premiere version of the software proprietary made the service
contract an easier sale.  GFS, Bitkeeper, how many pieces of software
might have been free if the service revenues had been there?

<p>This is deeply endangering the free software industry's fiscal
viability.

<p>Why are they reluctant to pay for service on something that is free?

<p>I get several emails a day from users who want me to tell them
something in our FAQ, or to diagnose that they didn't really recompile
the kernel module like they thought they did, etc.  I am happy to do
this, but I think I should get paid for it quite honestly.  

<p>We have a support page which has to have the lowest fee in the
industry, $25 a question, and we'll answer any Linux related question
(though most of the ones we get are ReiserFS related quite naturally.)
This support webpage gets used once every several days.  

<p>I refer the emailers with user error problems to the support page.
(Bug reports not in the FAQ we handle for free, though the proprietary
guys laugh and tell me that they charge for bug reports also.)  Maybe
40% of those emailers with user errors send me a flame back, angry
that I want money to answer a simple question that I know the answer
to.  They wouldn't send an email like this to their medical doctor
expecting a free diagnosis.

<p>So we have a real problem in our industry.  Economically irrational
behavior by users is killing our industry's revenues, and it
demolished the business plans that all of those Linux VCs funded once
and swore to never fund another one looking like it again.

<p>Where do we go from here?

<p>The advantage that Gnu/Linux has is passion.  We need some focused
passion.  If it is not logical, then we need to get going with the
psychological!  If you believe in the value of the free software
movement, then you need go to the next IT purchases meeting at your
company or government lab, and ask if there is a service contract from
the developers on all of the significantly used free software.  It is
that simple.

<p>We need to create a cultural norm in which it is considered proper
behavior to buy service from free software authors with the same
frequency one buys it from proprietary software authors.  The way to
do it is to acknowledge we have a problem, and start telling people
being irrational doesn't just leave you losing the cost of your time,
it leaves you hurting a movement you care about.

<p>There are other ways also, but I don't find them as attractive.  

<P>My guess is that most of the reason the proprietary vendors sell more
service contracts is that users are more inclined to buy service when
it is one more line on a contract than when it is a new contract.

<p>An economist might be tempted to call this a transaction cost, and
think rational behavior is occurring, but beware that temptation!
This marketing phenomenom holds true even for customers where the cost
of service would be hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Rational
economic behavior for the customer company as a whole it is not.

<p>We could for instance modify the license to require users to
purchase zero or more dollars worth of service from the software
authors (including issuing a purchase order or supply a credit card
even if the order is for zero dollars).  I think that some of those
vendors whose free software business plan seriously depends on service
revenue should consider experimenting with this.  Alternatively, we
should just not depend on service revenue for the support of free
software businesses.

<p>Perhaps one can better make substantial amounts of money from
service if one's product is complicated enough.  MySQL seems to be
making that approach work.  Namesys plans to add database and
hypertext functionality to ReiserFS.  It is possible that someday our
filesystem will offer sufficient functionality that having a Namesys
consultant will be worthwhile for the average fortune 500 company.  In
that case the whole revenue model could snowball, with each consultant
creating more features, each new feature creating more customers, and
the end result could eventually be a company the size of Anderson
consulting advising companies on their information bases.  While there
is nothing unique to open source about this, it is possible that open
source could allow a faster initial user adoption rate.

<p>It is interesting that free software service revenue at this time
seems to encourage economic concentration.  This is not very
encouraging if it holds true for the long term, and we end up with
proprietary software locking out competitors from the source code, and
free software vendors either not giving any of the revenue to
developers (most small vendors) or being highly concentrated large
vendors who favor funding software internally developed and
controlled.  The only thing worse than a state controlled economy is a
monopoly controlled economy.  

<p>Keep in mind that this is being written from a perspective in the
depths of the 2001 tech bust in which Namesys is managing "only" a
100% annual growth rate due to the severity of the economy.  While
ReiserFS usage is increasing by one or two orders of magnitude, all
non-governmental sources that were on the verge of increasing revenue
by an order of magnitude disappeared as those customers entered into
layoffs.

<h1>Free software is very effective as a market sampling methodology.</h1>
						    <p>
That does imply though that one must segment one's market.  One way to
segment the market is according to whether the software is integrated
with proprietary software.  Our licensing policy says that if you
make money from charging for usage licenses, then we must make money
too.  This allows Namesys to sell to fileserver vendors and
proprietary software vendors who want to add proprietary improvements
to ReiserFS.  All sales that Namesys has made in this area have
resulted from market sampling being very effective.  It generates far
more revenue at this time than service does.
						      <p>
Sales to proprietary OS vendors have not happened yet, but once the
economy recovers this could change, and interest has been expressed.
It takes just one sale of that size to make 8 years of work on a high
risk technological gamble pay off financially.
<h1>Open Sales</h1>
							<p>
We could make proprietary optional plugins, with the core filesystem
remaining GPL'd.  An issue though is how to prevent the poor from
being locked out of access to software.  Software fees are usually set
to what an average middle-aged man spending his boss's money at a US
corporation would be willing to pay.  Currently the only reasonable
option for the poor for most software is to pirate their software.
(Pirating can also serve as a form of anti-trust vigilante action when
the judicial system is as corrupted as it is in the US.)  Making
license fees proportional to storage hardware cost is the best way to
handle this.
							  <p>
This still leaves us with the economic inefficiency that occurs when a
user needs a spreadsheet three times a year, and he would like to use
the best one made, but the best one is priced appropriately for those
who use it several times a week.  I call this the focused taxation
inefficiency.
							  <p>
Most products are sold for more than their marginal cost because most
real markets are only semi-competitive.  Doing this distorts the
economy.  Software takes this distortion to its greatest extreme, and
best illuminates a longstanding inefficiency in real world semi-free
market economics.
							    <p>
I have an unproven hypothesis to put before you: The amount of
economic distortion is a function of not just the total dollar amount
traded and exceeding the marginal cost, but is a function also of the
ratio of price to marginal cost, and high ratios are "typically" more
distorting than low ratios, even if the total number of dollars is
made equal.  Persons interested in discussing proving this hypothesis
are encouraged to email me at reiser@namesys.com.  If the hypothesis
is true, then can we choose to defocus the disincentive?
							    <p>
Can we avoid the serious disadvantages of a state controlled, or
monopoly controlled, economy, and avoid the focused taxation
inefficiency at the same time?  How can we lockout neither poor
customers nor poor startup OS component suppliers?
							      <p>
I'd like you to consider the concept of open sales.  In an open sale,
users pay a fixed percentage of hardware costs as a fee for using a
software pool.  Users may use all software in the pool.  The users are
presented with a random sample of those developers who contributed to
the pool, and asked to allocate their fee among the sample in
proportion to their perceived utility.

<ul>Benefits: 

<li>A defocused disincentive to use software.  You may use the best of
anything in the pool.

<li>Poor people can afford the fee.

<li>More finegrained rewarding of developers in proportion to their
productivity than traditional copyright law due to reduced transaction
costs.

<li>More accurate rewarding due to assessment of value being made
after usage.
</ul>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
								  <p>
Open source is a niche we at Namesys enjoy inhabiting.  Its production
is not motivated mostly by money.  It is a gentleman's hobby for most,
and a profession for some who aren't in it for the money.  It is
likely to remain a niche.  As long as that is understood, a good time
can be had by all us mutant hairless monkeys.  It is amusing to give
away for free a filesystem faster than what a company worth billions
is able to write despite all their money.  Life should be enjoyed.
