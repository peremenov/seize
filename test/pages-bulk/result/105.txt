 <h>ANEMIA OVERVIEW


 <p>     Symptoms of anemia include fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, and
   even angina.  Physical exam findings include pallor, tachycardia, and
   jaundice.


 <p>     To generate a differential diagnosis anemia, first categorize
   the type of anemia (microcytic, normocytic, macrocytic) by MCV and
   furthermore with the ferritin and reticulocyte count.  Then, exam the
   peripheral smear: findings on the smear will narrow your differential,
   suggest additional medical problems the patient may have (i.e. target
   cells and liver disease, spur cells and uremia with uremic platelet
   dysfunction), and may reveal diagnoses such as microangiopathic
   hemolytic anemia (MAHA) in a timely fashion.  Finally, order
   additional tests to confirm your diagnosis and remember to get your
   tests before transfusing the patient.


 <h>      Factoids:

 <l>       Hospitalized patients will drop their hematocrit 1% per day
   from blood draws.

 <l>       Epogen causes hypertension if the hematocrit is raised > 35%
   in ESRD and does not work in the setting of iron deficiency.

 <l>        Follow the hemoglobin and not the hematocrit. The hematocrit
   is calculated from two measured values and has a Â± 3 point range for
   error.


    

 <h>MICROCYTIC ANEMIA (MCV < 80)

    

 <p>    Work-up: order iron, ferritin, transferrin, and if possible a
   red cell distribution width (RDW).

    

 <p>    Iron deficiency: On physical exam, look for koilonychia,
   atrophic tongue.  Iron deficiency usually does not cause a microcytic
   anemia until the hematocrit drops below 30%.  Ferritin is useful for
   diagnosing iron deficiency. The likelihood ratios are as follows: for
   a ferritin <15 the LR=50 in favor of iron deficiency anemia; for a
   ferritin <25 the LR=10, specificity of 98%; for a ferritin >100 the
   LR=0.1. Since ferritin is an acute phase reactant, some say it should
   not be used in the setting of inflammation; others say that in chronic
   inflammation a ferritin < 50 is highly suggestive of iron deficiency.
   Iron is low and transferrin or TIBC (total iron binding capacity) is
   high, which makes the transferrin saturation (iron divided by
   transferrin) low: a saturation <10% has a specificity of 88%. The RDW
   (reflecting anisocytosis) is high. Once you've made the diagnosis,
   rule out GI bleeding: around 60% of patients will have GI lesions.
   Order stool guiaics, a colonoscopy, and possibly an EGD.  With
   treatment, the hematocrit should be normal in 2 months; continue iron
   treatment 4-6 months to replete stores. Common side effect of oral
   iron is constipation.  IV iron available if patient refractory to PO,
   but has increased risk of anaphylaxis. Each PRBC transfused contains
   200 mg elemental iron.


 <p>   Sideroblastic anemia: hereditary cases are usually microcytic
   while acquired sideroblastic anemia may be normocytic. Acquired causes
   include lead, INH, EtOH, B[6] deficiency. Basophilic stippling and
   dimorphic RBC morphology is seen on peripheral blood smear.


 <p>    Thalassemia: The Mentzer index may be helpful: (MCV/RBC count)
   < 13 favors thalassemia over iron deficiency.  This test has a high
   sensitivity but low specificity.  Basically in iron deficiency, the
   marrow can't produce RBCs and they're small so the RBC count will be
   low along with the MCV.  In thalassemia, RBC production is preserved,
   though the cells are small and fragile.  So the RBC count is normal
   with a low MCV.  This concept may be more helpful than remembering the
   Mentzer index.  The RDW in thalassemia, unlike iron deficiency, is
   normal and may be a more accurate discriminant function in
   differentiating between the two.  Make the diagnosis of
   beta-thalassemia with hemoglobin electrophoresis. Alpha-thalassemia
   will not show up on electrophoresis: it is diagnosed by molecular
   diagnostic techniques. Order an "A-thal" on the lab slip. Think of
   Alpha thalassemia in Asians.  Beta thal in Meditteraneans.
   Differential diagnosis for target cells on smear: beta thalassemia,
   hemoglobin C disease, liver disease, beta-lipoproteinemia.  In general
   you should not see targets in sickle cell unless they are
   sickle-thalassemia or sickle-C.


 <p>    Anemia of chronic disease: Chronic inflammatory diseases, that
   is, such as cancer and collagen-vascular diseases. Transferrin is
   decreased, saturation increased, iron low, ferritin normally increased
   (non specific for chronic disease). The MCV rarely falls below 78,
   though the patient can become microcytic because they are functionally
   deficient of iron.

 <h>NORMOCYTIC ANEMIA (MCV 80-100)



 <h>     Reticulocytes:
 <l> First check a reticulocyte count.  Your goal is to come up with a
       reticulocyte index (RI).
 <l> If your lab gives you an absolute reticulocyte count, make into a
       percent reticulocyte count by dividing by the RBC count.  Make
       sure to convert your units!
 <l> Now correct the reticulocyte count for the patient's hematocrit
       (HCT).  Corrected reticulocyte count = % reticulocytes x (actual
       hematocrit Â¸ ideal hematocrit).
 <l> Now correct for early release of reticulocytes by dividing by (1 +
       0.5x) where x is 1 for every drop of 10% in the hematocrit.  For
       example, divide by 1.5 for HCT=35% and divide by 2 for HCT=25%.
 <l> You now have the reticulocyte index (RI).  If the RI < 2 for HCT
       10-35%, or < 3 for HCT < 10%, your patient has a hypoproliferative
       anemia.


 <h>     Decreased reticulocyte count:

 <h>    Primary bone marrow failure:

 <l>     Aplastic anemia/red cell aplasia: diagnosed by bone marrow
   biopsy.

 <l>       Myelophthisis: (replacement of the bone marrow) tear drops on
   smear

 <l>      Myelodysplastic syndrome

 <h>       Secondary bone marrow failure:

 <l>      Anemia of chronic disease: Normal or increased platelets and
   WBCs support this is the diagnosis.

 <l>     Iron, B12, folate deficiency (nutritional deficiency)

 <l>      Chronic kidney disease: use erythropoeitin when the
   creatinine clearance drops below 30 ml/min.

 <l>       Hypersplenism: usually anemia is concomitant with mild
   pancytopenia.

 <l>       Hypothyroidism: especially in the elderly

 <l>      Multiple myeloma: check SPEP, UPEP

 <l>       HIV/AIDS

 <l>       Mixed: e.g. an alcoholic with megaloblastic anemia from
   folate deficiency, and iron deficiency from GI bleeding. The MCV is
   normal, but the RDW is increased reflecting anisocytosis (cells of
   varying sizes).


 <h>     Increased reticulocyte count: check smear for schistocytes
   (intravascular hemolysis) and/or spherocytes (extravascular
   hemolysis).

 <l>       Acute blood loss: If you can't find a source, don't forget to
   rule out occult retroperitoneal bleed.

 <l>      Correction: of a production deficit. Peak MCV at 7-10 days.

 <l>       Hemolysis: see below.


 <h>     Hemolysis:
 <h> Classification is based on:

 <l>       Site of hemolysis (intravascular vs. extravascular) or

 <l>       Intrinsic (RBC defect) vs. an acquired extrinsic mechanism
   (where transfused cells will have a shortened life span).

 <l>       Send LDH, total and direct bilirubin, and possibly
   haptoglobin (level < 25 is 96% specific for hemolysis).  A normal LDH
   and haptoglobin > 25 helped rule out hemolysis in one small study.
   Haptoglobin overall is not very useful as it takes one week to return,
   is an acute phase reactant, and is very sensitive (leading to
   decreased specificity).
 <l> Intravascular causes:  red cell fragmentation syndromes, PNH,
       immediate transfusion reactions. Look for schistocytes and urine
       hemoglobin/hemosiderin/heme+ (sensitive).
 <l> Extravascular causes: RBCs destroyed by the reticuloendothelial
       system.
 <l> Extrinsic causes:

 <l>       Hypersplenism

 <l>      Antibody-mediated: warm (IgG) vs. cold (IgM) think Mono,
   Mycoplasma;check Coomb's. Spherocytes are on the smear. Drugs are a
   big offender as well.

  <l>       Trauma/ Red Cell fragmentation: heart valve, hemodialysis,
   malignant HTN, vasculitis, HELLP, cardiopulmonary bypass, TTP/HUS,
   DIC.  Look for schistocytes and helmet cells (even 1-2 per HPF), and
   spherocytes. Remember: DIC increases INR and PTT, HUS and TTP do not.

 <l>      Infection/toxin: malaria, babesiosis, clostridia,
   brown-recluse, copper (Wilson's disease).

 <l>       Intrinsic defects: all are hereditary except PNH.

 <l>       Membrane: Hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary
   elliptocytosis.

 <l>      Enzyme:  e.g. G6PD deficiency: normal smear and Coomb's.
   Check G6PD levels, which may be normal after an acute hemolytic
   episode or post transfusion. Consider this in HIV patients,
   particularly African Americans, taking PCP prophylaxis. Although this
   is X-linked recessive, it may still occur in females due to
   lyonization.

 <l>       Hemoglobinopathy: sickle cell, thalassemias, Hgb C, Hgb E.

 <l>       PNH: complement-mediated lysis. Consider with pancytopenia,
   unexplained thrombosis (especially intra-abdominal) and an elevated
   reticulocyte count and LDH. A rare diagnosis.

   haptoglobin in hemolytic disease.

  <h>MACROCYTIC ANEMIA (MCV > 100)



 <p>     Megaloblastic: hypersegmented neutrophils (> 5% of neutrophils
   with 5 lobes or > 1% with 6 lobes) are seen on the smear. An MCV > 120
   is almost pathognomonic for megaloblastic anemia. Ovalocytes may be
   seen, but are nonspecific. On physical exam, look for atrophic tongue.

 <l>      B12 deficiency: diagnose with serum B12. This value may be
   falsely decreased secondary to folate deficiency or type 1
   cryoglobulinemia (e.g. multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom's
   macroglobulinemia). Look for subacute combined degeneration.  Can send
   homocysteine and methylmalonic acid.  Schilling test to look at source
   of deficiency. May have pancytopenia.

 <l>        Folate deficiency: diagnose with RBC-Folate level.  (Serum
   folate fluctuates and is a poor proxy for folate stores).  May be
   falsely low secondary to B12 deficiency.

 <l>       Drug-induced: chemo, methotrexate (MTX), hydroxyurea,
   azathioprine, etc.

 <l>       Note: repletion of vitamin B12 should always accompany folate
   and iron therapy until you are sure the patient does not have multiple
   deficiencies, in order to avoid aplastic-type crisis and/or high
   output CHF.  In addition, folate may partially correct the
   megaloblastic anemia of B12 deficiency while the neurologic symptoms
   progress.


 <h>    Non-megaloblastic: MCV < 110 in most cases.

 <l>        Alcoholism: most common cause of macrocytic anemia.

 <l>        Liver disease

 <l>        Hypothyroidism

 <l>       Reticulocytosis: although the reticulocyte MCV is 160 microns,
   reticulocytosis rarely causes an MCV above 110.  Polychromasia is seen
   on smear.

 <l> Spurious: hyperglycemia and hypernatremia, secondary to
   osmotic swelling.

 <l>        Aplastic anemia

 <l>     Myelodysplastic syndromes: giant platelets, hypogranulated
   neutrophils, bi-lobed neutrophils.

 <l>       Drugs: anticonvulsants, AZT.

 <h> DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS


 <p>       See also Pulmonary: Pulmonary embolism.


 <p>   Over 9 in 10 pulmonary emboli originate from DVTs, and the
   treatment of PE and DVT are usually identical.


 <p>    DVTs are associated with calf pain and tenderness. Homan's
   sign--pain when dorsiflexing the foot with the knee extended--is
   neither sensitive nor specific and should be abandoned.


 <p>     DVT prophylaxis should be addressed in all inpatients.
   Encourage early ambulation and order physical therapy when indicated.
   Obtain prophylaxis with sequential compression devices, low dose
   ultrafractionated heparin, or low molecular weight heparin (e.g.
   enoxaparin).  See also Medical Consultation: DVT/PE prophylaxis.


 <p>     Simple clinical model to diagnose DVT:

 <l>       Give the patient one (1) point for each of the following (if
   they are present): active cancer, immobilization, bedridden > than 3
   days due to surgery, localized tenderness, entire leg swelling,
   asymmetric > 3 cm calf swelling,  pitting edema, or collateral
   superficial veins (nonvaricose).
 <l> Is there an alternative diagnosis that is as likely or more likely
       than DVT?  If yes, subtract 2 points.
 <l>  Score > 3: high probability of DVT, prevalence of DVT 75%.
 <l>  Score 1-2: moderate probability of DVT, prevalence of DVT 17%.
 <l>  Score 0: low probability of DVT, prevalence of 3%.


 <p>     Work-up of suspected DVT:

 <l>        D-dimers: very useful if your local hospital has the ELISA
   test which is very sensitive (good for ruling out DVT).  Some labs use
   the latex agglutination test, which is only 85-90% sensitive. Thus, in
   a patient with a non-diagnostic V/Q scan (for PE) or Doppler
   ultrasound (for DVT), a negative D-dimer (ELISA method) means it is
   probably safe not to anticoagulate if your clinical suspicion is low
   or moderate.

 <l>        Doppler ultrasound: This test is better at detecting DVTs
   above the knee (which, in fact, are the clinically significant ones as
   clots below the knee rarely cause pulmonary embolism).  Ultrasound is
   50% sensitive in an asymptomatic individual, and therefore cannot be
   used to rule out PE. Ultrasound is also less sensitive than venogram
   for calf DVT.


 <p>     Hypercoagulability work-up:
 <l>  After the first event, the hypercoaguable work-up will lead to an
       etiology in only 30% of patients; after the second DVT only 50%
       will eventually have an etiology determined.  Moreover, only
       10-20% of people with an idiopathic DVT will ever have another
       event.

 <l>       It is not necessary to begin the work up of anticoagulation at
   the time of the clot: the results won't change your management and
   will take a while to come back anyway; therefore, consider an
   outpatient work-up.

   <l>       Guidelines for hypercoagulability work-up:

 <l>        Draw an extra blue top tube before starting heparin or
   warfarin if you suspect a hypercoaguable state: heparin will interfere
   with assays for antithrombin III and the lupus anticoagulant.

 <l>        Protein C, S, anticardiolipin antibodies, homocysteine,
   prothrombin 20210A, Factor V Leiden, and MTHFR mutations (leading to
   hyperhomocysteinemia) can be sent when patients are taking heparin.
   Note that Proteins C and S are vitamin K dependent factors and will be
   lowered by warfarin therapy.

 <l>         AT III, Protein C, and Protein S may be transiently depressed
   during the acute event, and only persistent lupus anticoagulants are
   associated with hypercoagulability. Therefore, repeat abnormal tests
   later to make an accurate diagnosis.

 <l>        Note that there is not a consensus that all patients with
   unprovoked DVT/PE should have a hypercoagulability work-up.  The most
   common defects are not associated with recurrent disease, and the ones
   that are, are uncommon.  A targeted work-up is likely a more
   reasonable approach (e.g. send antiphospholipid antibody as persistent
   lupus anticoagulant is associated with venous/arterial recurrence and
   may require a higher INR goal for warfarin therapy).


 <p>      Treatment: typically involves heparin (or enoxaparin) and
   warfarin.  Some advocate giving patients heparin for 5 days, even if
   their INR becomes therapeutic in less than 5 days. Patients should be
   therapeutically anticoagulated as soon as possible (within 24 hours).
   Thus, it is better to overshoot and risk bleeding than to undershoot
   and risk further embolic/thrombotic events.  See Hematology/Oncology:
   Heparin and Hematology/Oncology: Warfarin (below).

 <h>HEPARIN


 <p>    Risk factors for bleeding while on heparin:

 <l>       Surgery, trauma, or stroke within the previous 14 days.

<l>        History of peptic ulcer disease, GI bleeding or GU bleeding.

<l>       Platelets < 150K.

<l>       Age > 70 years.

<l>       Hepatic failure, uremia, bleeding diathesis, brain metastases.


  <p>     When to use low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin): LMWH
   eliminates the need to monitor PTT and adjust dosages. You may send
   selected patients home with enoxaparin and warfarin, rather than
   keeping them in-house on heparin for 5 days or until they are
   therapeutic on warfarin (see Hematology/Oncology: Outpatient therapy
   for venous thromboembolism).  Moreover, LMWH is associated with a
   lower incidence of heparin-associated thrombocytopenia.  Regular,
   ultrafractionated heparin is preferable when:
<l>  Patients require prolonged hospitalization anyway (cost savings
       over enoxaparin) or
<l>  Rapid reversal of anticoagulation might be necessary (e.g.
       possible surgery).


  <p>    Consider a hematology consult before using LMWH in the
   following situations:

<l> ·       Weight > 150 kg.

<l>       Creatinine > 2, or creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min.

<l>       Pregnancy.

   heparin: mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, dosing, monitoring,
   efficacy, and safety.  Chest. 2001 Jan;119(1 Suppl):64S-94S.

    

    

<h> WARFARIN


<p>      Give the warfarin on day one of heparin or enoxaparin if
   long-term anticoagulation is desired.  Usually 5.0-7.5 mg PO at night
   (to ensure absorption on an empty stomach) on Day 1, then 2.5-7.5 mg
   PO QHS (most often 5 mg). Increase in the INR of > 0.3-0.4 units per
   day should result in a dose reduction (otherwise an INR overshoot is
   likely).


<p>      Goal for INR:
<l>  An INR of 2.5-3.5 for mechanical prosthetic valves or recurrent
       systemic thromboembolism
<l>  INR of 2.0-3.0 for most others (uncomplicated DVT/PE).


<p>      Information about the patient's past warfarin dosing history
   will help you titrate appropriately. Congestive heart failure, liver
   disease, vitamin K deficiency and certain medications influence
   warfarin response. Tailor the duration of warfarin therapy to the
   individual and the indication - usually three months to life.

<h>OUTPATIENT THERAPY FOR VENOUS THROMBOEMBOLISM


<h>     Indications:

<l>      Clinically stable patients with DVT or PE documented with
   imaging study.

<l>        Patients must be motivated and interested in home
   self-injection and frequent follow-up.


<h>    Contraindications:

<l>      Co-morbid conditions: Active peptic ulcer disease, bleeding in
   last 14 days, brain metastases, CVA in last 10 days, blindness, CNS or
   cord injury/surgery in last 10 days, family bleeding diathesis,
   patient weight <35 kg, platelets < 80K or fall of > 40%.

<l>       Anesthesia: Spinal or epidural anesthesia in past 3 days.

<l>      Medication conflicts: prior sensitivity to heparin,
   concomitant thrombolytic therapy, need for high-dose NSAIDs other than
   ibuprofen, naproxen, or CelebrexÂ®.  VioxxÂ® may result in warfarin
   sensitivity.

<l>      Cognition problems: inability to maintain diary, inject
   medications, reliably follow medication schedules, recognize change in
   health status, or understand directions from home health team.


<p>     Initial therapy: enoxaparin (1 mg/kg SQ q12h) plus warfarin (5
   mg PO qhs; 7.5 mg PO qhs if > 85 kg).


<h>    Maintenance algorithm:

<l>      Continue enoxaparin until patient has received five days of
   enoxaparin and has two consecutive INR > 2.0.

<l>     Adjust warfarin to keep INR in desired range.

<l>       Check PT/INR frequently after day 2 until patient is on stable
   dose of warfarin.



<h> SUPRATHERAPEUTIC PT/PTT


 <p>      Differential diagnosis for prolonged PT: warfarin, liver
   disease, poor nutrition, vitamin K deficiency (antibiotics,
   nutritional, fat malabsorption), deficiency or inhibitor for factors
   II, V, VII, or X, DIC, heparin bolus.


 <p>      Differential diagnosis for prolonged PTT: heparin, congenital
   deficiency of VIII, IX, XI, von Willebrand's disease,
   anti-phospholipid antibody, inhibitor to any factor except VII, liver
   disease, DIC.


 <p>     Use oral vitamin K to correct mild to moderate PT prolongation.
   Correction occurs within 10-12 hours. Subcutaneous vitamin K is as
   good as IV vitamin K, minus the risk of anaphylaxis.


 <p>      FFP lasts 4-6 hours (need to give concomitant vitamin K).


 <p>      Bebulin is a plasma-derived concentrate of factors II, VII, IX,
   and X.  It should be used in life threatening bleeds associated with
   warfarin.  Dose Bebulin ~50 U/kg IV push (need to give concomitant
   vitamin K).


 <h>      For heparin associated bleeding:

 <l>        Unfractionated heparin: Protamine 1 mg for every 100 units
   heparin given. Dose by adding the amount given during each prior hour
   divided by 2 ^number of hours back.  For example, a patient on a
   heparin drip at 500 units/hour for 3 hours (without a bolus) would
   have approximately (500/2^0)+(500/2^1)+(500/2^2) =  500 + (500/2) +
   (500/4) = 875 units of circulating heparin.  Therfore, the patient
   should be given 8-9 mg of protamine.

 <l>        Enoxaparin: 1mg:1mg. Protamine may reverse 40-50% of the drug
   effect.

 
 <h> UREMIC BLEEDING


 <h>    Tips:

 <l>       Keep hematocrit > 24%

 <l>       Keep platelets > 75K

 <l>       FFP may be helpful if bleeding occurs in the setting of an
   elevated INR


 <h>     Therapies:

 <l>      Dialysis

 <l>      Conjugated estrogen 0.6 mg/kg IV QD x 5 days

 <l>      DDAVP 0.3 mcg/kg IV q12 hours x 2



 <h>BLOOD PRODUCTS - COMPONENTS


 <p>     Premeds: consider pre-medicating with Benadryl 25 mg PO/IV and
   Tylenol 650 mg PO/PR before each unit.


 <h>    Packed red blood cells (PRBC):

        Most plasma removed. One unit should raise the hematocrit by 3
   points or hemoglobin by 1 g/dL.

  <l>      Leuko-poor/leuko-filtered red blood cells have most WBCs
   removed to make it less antigenic. Use in patients prone to
   transfusion reactions and in patients requiring multiple transfusions
   (bone marrow transplant, leukemia, chemotherapy).

  <l>       Washed red blood cells have WBC almost all removed. Use as for
   leuko-poor RBC; note that they are more expensive.  Used for patients
   with allergic reaction to transfusions.

   <l>      Irradiated blood cells have lymphocytes killed, decreasing
   likelihood of graft-versus host disease (GVHD) in bone marrow
   transplant patients.

  <l>      CMV negative blood used for patients who are CMV negative and
   are pre-transplant or post-transplant.


  <h>.     Platelets:

  <l>      A 6-pack should  ideally raise platelet count by 50-60K; For
   dysfunctional platelets (e.g. in uremia), DDAVP is usually given at
   0.3 mcg/kg IV q12-24 hours x 2. Do not correct platelets for
   paracentesis.

    <l>       Indications:

    <l>      Platelets < 10-20K for non-bleeding patient.

     <l>      Platelets < 50K for bleeding, pre-op, or pre-procedure.

    <l>       Platelets < 75K for uremic bleeding patients.

     <l>       Platelets < 100K for CNS or intraocular bleed.

  <l>       Cross-matched platelets may be used when patient has been
   sensitized to random-donor platelets and no longer bumps their
   platelet counts after transfusion; cross-matching typically takes at
   least 1-2 days as well as lab medicine approval at most institutions.

 v       Always check a 1 hour post-transfusion platelet count to
   ensure a response and to monitor for alloimmunization.


   <h>    Fresh frozen plasma (FFP):

  <l>     A high PT is frequently encountered in end-stage liver
   disease. It is generally okay to leave a high PT alone when a patient
   is not bleeding. For those with refractory bleeding, use an FFP
   drip--the half-life of FFP is about 4-6 hours.

   <l>      FFP is indicated if the PT > 18 seconds and is associated with
   bleeding or planned procedures.


  <h>    Cryoprecipitate:

   <l>       Contains factor VIII, von Willebrand factor, and fibrinogen.

  <l>      Use is generally reserved for patients with quantitative
   fibrinogen deficiency (e.g. DIC) and qualitative fibrinogen deficits
   (e.g. acquired dysfibrinogenemia associated with liver disease). Its
   use in patients with hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) and von
   Willebrand disease has been supplanted by the use of specific factor
   products that are safer and more efficacious.

   <l>      Advantage: you can replete with less volume than FFP.

  <h>BLOOD PRODUCTS - COMPLICATIONS



  <p>     Work-up: for all transfusion reactions consider a workup for a
   hemolytic reaction: blood cultures and hemolysis labs, including
   purple top for Coombs and red top for repeat type and cross.  The
   blood bank is required to investigate and will help. The different
   types of reactions are listed below.


   <h>    Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction:

  <l>      Preexisting anti-RBC antibodies in the recipient hemolyze
   donated blood. Usually caused by ABO incompatibility due to a clerical
   error. Fever and hypotension occur early in the transfusion; chills,
   flank pain, and dyspnea may occur.

  <l>      Stop blood product immediately, as little as 30 cc can be
   fatal.

  <l>       Provide hemodynamic and renal support.

   <l>      Maintain diuresis with IV fluids and furosemide; consider
   alkalinization of urine with bicarbonate to prevent renal failure.
   Watch K^+, CK.


  <h>    Delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction:

  <l>     An extravascular immune-mediated process mediated by
   noncomplement-binding IgG. Ideally, the "screen" portion of the type
   and screen will identified patients susceptible to this complication.
   Fever, jaundice, and anemia occur 2 days to 2 weeks after transfusion.


  <h>     Anaphylaxis:

  <l>      This is different from an acute hemolytic reaction.
   Interestingly, the reaction is not IgE mediated, but caused by
   immune-complex activation of complement - by "anaphylatoxins."
   Symptoms are anaphylactoid, occur early in transfusion, and include
   laryngeal edema.

   <l>       Stop the transfusion

  <l>       Give epinephrine and steroids

  <l>       Wash subsequent blood products, and avoid FFP


  <h>     Bacterial contamination:

  <l>       Look for endotoxemia--the onset of high fever/shock within 4
   hours of transfusion. Platelets are far more likely to be contaminated
   with bacteria than blood, because they are stored are room
   temperature.


   <h>     Acute lung injury:

  <l>       i.e. "noncardiogenic pulmonary edema". Also termed
   "TRALI"--transfusion-related acute lung injury.  This is caused by
   donor antibodies against recipient WBCs. Respiratory failure occurs
   within 6 hours of transfusion and treatment is supportive.


  <h>    Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reaction:

  <l>      This is characterized by fever > 1Â° C during or within 2 hours
   of completing transfusion. It occurs with 1 in 5 platelet transfusion
   reactions and is of limited clinical significance. It is questionable
   whether it is necessary to discontinue the transfusion. Caused by
   antibodies against foreign donor leukocyte antigens.


  <h>    Urticarial reaction:

  <l>       Some say it is okay to continue transfusion if the patient
   responds to antihistamines. Again, this is different from--and does
   not progress to--an anaphylactiod reaction.

   <l>       For nonhemolytic reactions:

  <l>       Benadryl 25-50 mg and Tylenol 650 mg for mild transfusion
   reactions.

  <l>       Hydrocortisone 50-100 mg IV for moderate and severe
   reactions.





  <h>NEUTROPENIC FEVER: ABSOLUTE NEUTROPHIL COUNT < 500


  <p>    If patient has HIV, see Infectious Diseases: HIV and fever.


  <h>.     Non-bone marrow transplant patients:

  <l>     Obtain blood culture x 2, urine culture, sputum Gram stain and
   culture, C. difficile toxin if patient has been on antibiotics, and
   CXR.

  <l>     Order neutropenic precautions (no rectals, no flowers, no
   fruit), neutropenic diet, mouth care with Peridex 10 cc sw/sp bid,
   Nystatin 10 cc sw/sw qid or Mycelex troche 1 qid, and Tylenol 650 mg q
   4-6 hour prn.

   <l>      Consider monotherapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics such as
   ceftazidime, cefipime or anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam. Cover for Gram
   negative bacteria including Pseudomonas.  Also cover Gram positives
   such as Staph aureus and Strep viridans.

   <l>     If prolonged neutropenia, consider fungal infection and
   adding amphotericin B (typically 1 mg/kg IV qd).

  <l>       For nosocomial acquisition, suspected IV catheter infection,
   known colonization with MRSA/PRSP, (+) blood culture for Gram positive
   cocci, or a hypotensive patient, consider covering MRSA by adding
   vancomycin.

   <l>      Double-cover documented Pseudomonas by adding an
   aminoglycoside or a fluoroquinolone, such as ciprofloxacin. The
   fluoroquinolone is preferable given the renal toxicity of
   aminoglycosides.


  <h>     Bone marrow transplant patients: the guidelines above still apply,
except for the following:

  <l>     Most hospitals that have a bone marrow transplant unit have an
antibiotic algorithm that you should follow when treating bone marrow
transplant patients with neutropenic fever.

  <l>    The patients most likely to suffer from full blown sepsis syndrome
are those who are penicillin-allergic.



  <h>SICKLE CELL PAIN CRISIS


  <p>   Your hospital staff typically know these patients well.  Often, the
   patient's primary physician has contracted with the patient for an
   individualized pain protocol.  Consider consultation with the
   hematologist or pain service to get the exact details (if they
   exist).  Don't be surprised by massive opiate tolerance and the need
   to rapidly escalate the analgesia dose required for relief: remember,
   physicians typically under-treat pain.  Unlike most opioids, such as
   morphine and oxycodone, codeine and hydrocodone have ceilings beyond
   which increasing doses will not result in increasing analgesia.


  <h>     Tips:

  <l>      Stroke, MI, persistent priapism, or intractable pain
   characterize acute vaso-occlusive crises. Exchange transfusion is
   indicated in these cases. Also, multi-organ failure requires urgent
   exchange transfusion.

  <l>       If patient with frequent episodes of pain crisis, consider
   hydroxyurea as prophylaxis.
  <l> In the past, the dogma for treating sickle cell crises called for
       aggressive fluids, oxygen, and even bicarbonate infusions as
       methods to reverse the "sickling" process in the red blood cells.
       However, we have since learned that the event that led to the
       sickle crisis (and thus the "sickling") has already occurred by
       the time the patient comes into the ER.  Therefore, these measures
       are unlikely to be helpful and may be harmful (see below).


  <h>  Orders:

  <l>      IV: moderate hypotonic (e.g. D[5]Â½NS) hydration.  Aggressive
   hydration can lead to or exacerbate acute chest syndrome.

   <l>       DIET: NPO; advance diet as tolerated.

   <l>     NURSING: O[2] 0-4 L/min by NC. (If respiratory status is
   compromised, remember acute chest syndrome. A new pulmonary
   infiltrate, fever, chest pain, cough, tachypnea and cough are
   characteristic).

  <l>     LAB: CBC, reticulocyte count, cultures, electrolytes, BUN,
   creatinine, bilirubin, U/A, CXR.  Draw red-top tube for type and hold.
   (If patient is to be transfused, alert the blood bank that the patient
   has sickle cell disease; these patients will be screened more
   thoroughly to avoid alloimmunization associated with frequent
   transfusions).

   <l>      MEDS:Folic acid 1 mg PO QD and analgesic du jour.  Avoid
   Demerol: these patients will inevitably require huge doses, and are at
   greatly increased risk of seizures.


  <p>    Try to determine precipitating factor(s): stress, dehydration,
   drug use, infection, hypoxia, MI, etc. Although, remember that many of
   these patients come in and out of the hospital for "routine" pain
   crises without specific precipitants. While pain crises often present
   with non-specific elevations in WBC and low-grade fevers, there always
   is the potential for something bad to be going on. Therefore complete
   work up of concomitant infection is important.


   <p>     Acute chest syndrome: This is one of the dreaded complications
   of sickle cell disease and a leading cause of death in adults with
   this disease.  You should think of this diagnosis in any patient with
   cough, chest pain, wheezing, shortness of breath, fever, and/or new
   infiltrate on CXR who has a history of sickle cell disease.  Etiology
   is not fully known, but thought to involve micro/macro vascular
   infarction, pulmonary fat emboli, and concurrent viral/bacterial
   infection.  Management primarily consists of supportive care,
   bronchodilators, treatment of coexisting infection, and transfusions
   if needed.  In addition, a simple transfusion may be adequate, but if
   the patient's clinical situation worsens an exchange transfusion may
   be needed.

   chest syndrome in sickle cell disease. National Acute Chest Syndrome

  <h> THROMBOCYTOPENIA


  <p>    Defined as platelet count < 150K. Generally, platelets > 50K
   are not associated with significant bleeding, and spontaneous bleeding
   rarely happens with platelets >10-20K in the absence of coagulopathy
   or qualitative platelet defect.

  <l>        Avoid intramuscular injections, rectal exams, suppositories,
   and enemas.

  <l>      Avoid drugs that interfere with platelet function (e.g.
   NSAIDs/ASA, certain beta-lactam antibiotics).


  <p>    History: "B"-symptoms (such as fevers, night sweats, weight
   loss), GI bleed, epistaxis.


 <p>     Physical examination: look for lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly,
   ecchymoses, petechiae, purpura. Petechiae indicate a significant risk
   for intracerebral hemorrhage.


 <p>     Labs: peripheral smear, PT/PTT, LDH (MAHA), BUN/Cr (HUS/TTP).
   Get HIV, ANA when indicated, and consider toxoplasmosis, EBV, and CMV
   serology if lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, or "B"-symptoms are
   detected.


 <h>    Etiologies:

 <l>      Decreased Production

 <l>       Aplastic anemia

 <l>     Megaloblastic anemia: B12 or folate deficiency

 <l>        Hematologic malignancies: myelodysplasia, leukemia, myeloma

 <l>        Marrow infiltration: lymphoma, myelofibrosis, metastatic
   tumor, TB, Gaucher's disease

 <l>       Drug-induced: EtOH, thiazides, estrogens, Septra,
   chemotherapy, cimetidine, famotidine

 <l>       Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH): rare and
   associated with pancytopenia.

 <l>       Infections: mono, influenza, rubella, hemorrhagic fever,
   sepsis.

 <l>        Increased Destruction: classically associated with large
   platelets on the smear.

 <l>        Immune mediated:

 <l>      ITP: sending platelet associated antibody has low sens/spec,
   treat with steroids, IVIG, splenectomy

   <l>     Neoplasia-associated: CLL

 <l>       Drug-induced: quinidine, heparin (HIT), rifampin, sulfa,
   indomethacin, gold

 <l>      SLE, RA

 <l>      HIV-associated thrombocytopenia

 <l>     Post-transfusion purpura

 <l>       Non-immune mediated:

 <l>      DIC: increased PT/PTT and D-dimers, decreased
   platelet/fibrinogen, hemolytic anemia, prosthetic valves.

 <l>      HUS

 <l>     TTP: always increased LDH. Decreased platelet, and normal
   PT/PTT.

 <l>       Pre-ecclampsia/ecclampsia

 <l>      Toxic shock syndrome

 <l>       Vasculitis

 <l>      Infections: rickettsia, CMV, EBV, malaria, sepsis, etc.

 <l>       Sequestration: Hypersplenism

 <l>       Pseudo-thrombocytopenia: Blood clumping on CBC, need to check
   smear to rule out

 <h> HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA (HIT)


  <p>     There are primarily two types of HIT:




  <p>    Diagnosis: think of this diagnosis in your hospitalized patients
whose platelet count starts dropping.

  <l>     You can diagnose HIT type 2 by sending platelet factor 4 antibody,
although this syndrome is primarily a clinical diagnosis.



  <p>     Incidence: HIT occurs less frequently now with the increased use of
low molecular weight heparin.



  <p>   Complications: the thrombotic complications can be arterial or venous
and often occur at sites of preexisting pathology.


  <p>   Treatment: includes stopping all heparin products (including heparin
flushes and coated catheters), and instituting alternate anticoagulation, as
these patients are at increased risk of thrombosis.  Choices include
danaparoid (a heparinoid) or lepirudin and argatroban (direct thrombin
inhibitors).

  <h>ONCOLOGIC EMERGENCIES

    

  <l>     Cord compression: see Neurology: Cord compression for more
   details.  Remember early treatment is key--dexamethasone, radiation,
   and neurosurgical evaluation.


  <l>      Neutropenic fever: see Hematology/Oncology: Neutropenic fever.


  <l>     Cerebral metastases: can present as headache, seizures, altered
   mental status, or focal deficit.  Common in breast and lung cancer.
   Diagnose with head CT.  Treat with dexamethasone, radiation, and
   possible surgery.  With edema, mass effect, and/or midline shift,
   consider measures to control the rise in intracranial pressure (ICP)
   such as mannitol and hyperventilation.


  <l>     Carcinomatous meningitis: may present as seizures, focal
   neurologic deficits, peripheral neuropathy, or altered mental status.
   Occurs most often with breast cancer, lymphoma, and leukemia.
   Diagnose  with spinal fluid cytology.   Treat with intrathecal
   chemotherapy or whole brain radiation.


  <l>     Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome: presents with facial and/or
   upper extremity edema as well as dyspnea on exertion.  Commonly seen
   with lung cancer and lymphoma.  Diagnose with CT scan (gold standard).
    Treat with radiation and/or chemotherapy based on tumor type.
   Surgery is often risky and dangerous.


  <l>    Hypercalcemia: Presents gradually with fatigue, anorexia,
   constipation, polyuria, and confusion.  Can occur with squamous cell
   carcinomas, breast cancer, small cell lung cancer, and myeloma.  Treat
   with hydration, lasix, calcitonin and pamidronate if needed. See also
   Acid-base/Electrolytes: Hypercalcemia.


  <l>     Tumor lysis syndrome: findings include  potassium,
   phosphorous,  uric acid,  creatinine, and Â¯ calcium.  Often occurs
   with tumors that are bulky and very chemotherapy-sensitive.   Seen
   often in Burkitt's lymphoma.  Prevent with hydration and allopurinol.
   If patient develops syndrome, treat electrolyte abnormalities and
   continue hydration and allopurinol.


  <l>    Hyperviscosity: patients present with nonspecific CNS symptoms
   such as headache, dizziness, somnolence, and blurry vision.  More
   often occurs in patient with myeloma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia,
   and polycythemia vera.   Obtain CSF, head CT to rule out other CNS
   processes. Treat with hydration, phlebotomy (for polycythemia vera),
   and chemotherapy.


  <l>      Leukostasis: occurs with very high white blood cell count in
   acute leukemias.  Symptoms include hypoxia, renal insufficiency,
   altered mental status, and somnolence. Can worsen during induction
   chemotherapy.  Obtain CSF and head CT to rule out other diagnoses.
   Treat with leukopheresis, hydration, induction chemotherapy, and
   possibly hydroxyurea.  Avoid blood product transfusions as this might
   worsen symptoms.  Wait until after you white blood cells have been
   removed by leukopheresis.


  <l>   DIC: often occurs in patients with AML (especially M[3] variant)
   and adenocarcinoma patients.  Diagnose by PT/PTT, fibrinogen, platelet
   count, and D-dimers.  Treat by correcting deficits--platelet
   transfusions, FFP, vitamin K, cryoprecipitate.  Treat the underlying
   cause.  Heparin is occasionally used to suppress the consumptive
   process, but the data on this is limited.
