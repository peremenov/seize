<h>   $1.1 Million Grant To Study Factors Controlling Cell Division

<p>   St. Louis, May 19, 1999 - Helen Piwnica-Worms, Ph.D., professor of
   cell biology and physiology at Washington University School of
   Medicine in St. Louis, has received a four-year $1.1 million grant
   from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences. Piwnica-Worms
   will analyze the molecular factors that regulate a cell's decision to
   divide into two daughter cells. When regulation goes astray, cells
   divide unrestrainedly into tumors.

 <p>  In some ways, a cell resembles a new-fangled car that won't move until
   the driver is buckled in.

<p>   A cell divides only if molecular sensors detect that its genetic
   material, DNA, is ready. Having undamaged DNA is crucial prior to
   division because DNA provides the molecular blueprint daughter cells
   need to survive.

<p>   Piwnica-Worms will clarify how the two major DNA sensors help cells
   make the division decision. These sensors, which are similar in yeast
   cells and human cells, check for damage to DNA and check whether the
   DNA has been faithfully duplicated.

<p>   Piwnica-Worms will study how two factors regulate a component of the
   DNA damage sensor, a protein called cell division cycle molecule 25C
   (Cdc25C). When DNA is in good shape, Cdc25C activates another protein
   that switches on cell division.

<p>   Her laboratory previously helped identify proteins called Chk1 and
   Cds1 in human and yeast cells that prevent Cdc25C from activating the
   switch if a cell's DNA is damaged or not faithfully replicated.
   Piwnica-Worms will study how Chk1 and Cds1 interact with Cdc25C.

<p>   The molecular switch, Cdc2, also is regulated by other proteins.
   Piwnica-Worms will determine whether a regulator called Wee1 in human
   and yeast cells keeps the switch from working when division is
   inappropriate.

<p>   The Wee1 protein is found in the nucleus, where sensors are thought to
   evaluate DNA's readiness for cell division. But a regulator found
   outside the nucleus in cells of humans and other many-celled organisms
   might inhibit Cdc2 activity early on. Piwnica-Worms hopes to discover
   which regulator plays this role and whether the regulators act on
   other proteins.

<p>   She also will study mutated forms of the second regulator to determine
   how it interacts with targets. This work could reveal a way to keep
   Cdc2 outside the nucleus, preventing it from triggering cell division.

<p>   "If you could keep Cdc2 out of the nucleus," Piwnica-Worms says,
   "cells such as cancer cells would never divide."

<p>   The research also might suggest other ways to kill cancer cells. For
   example, it might suggest ways to disable the DNA damage sensor to
   make cancer cells divide when they can't survive. Piwnica-Worms notes
   that a drug that acts in this way is currently in early clinical
   trials.

<p>   In other work, she also will study interactions between the sensor
   components that evaluate DNA duplication and those that detect DNA
   damage. Piwnica-Worms already helped identify an inhibitor of Cdc25C
   that is important at both checkpoints.
