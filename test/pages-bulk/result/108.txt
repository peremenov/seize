<h>   THE REPUBLIC
<h>   Policies for Political,Electoral & Constitutional Reform
 <h>  Issued 5th April,2000, Adopted by the National Council, January 2000

<p>   [*Note: The first section of Part B, Clause 2b,C is still in
   OfficialDraft mode, and is subject to further discussion at the June
   2000 Conference]

 <h>   Preamble:

<p>   a/ The PLP proceeds from thepremise that major political, electoral
   and constitutional reforms are longoverdue in Australia and that they
   are not and will not be tackled by the majorparties. In developing a
   blueprint for change we prioritise an order in thechange process on
   the basis of urgency and achievability. Therefore, whatfollows is an
   ambit package, eg. proportional representation for all Parliamentsis
   high on the list, followed by the abolition of state upper houses,
   followedby the creation of a two-tier structure of elected government.
   Depending on thechanging preferences of the Australian people some
   stages may be speeded up,collapsed or skipped altogether. What we
   present here is an overall concept forchange.

 <h>  b/ Our principal policies for a newRepublic are:
  <l> President: elected DIRECTLY by the people, with symbolic powers
       only:
<l>Note: the Irish Presidential model provides a useful guide:
       strictly symbolic powers unlike the present powers of either the
       Monarch or Australian Governor-General. In addition, persons who
       have been members of any Parliament during the past 10 years
       cannot be candidates. Steps would be enforced to prevent
       expenditure by parties or business interests of large sums of
       money to distort the result of the poll.
<l> A President is needed to perform a variety of ceremonial and
       legislative functions.
<l> Two-tier system of elected government: National government and a
       much strengthened local government system, coupled with
       administrative local government regions
<l> Proportional Representation: aimed to create greater diversity in
       Parliament
<l> Improvement in the Quality of Political Executive Government, with
       consideration of a number of options for democratisation and
       broadening of cabinet government in Australia.
<l> Fixed four-year parliamentary terms
<l> A comprehensive Bill of Rights
<l> Safeguards for: (a) the environment; (b) Indigenous Peoples'
       rights; (c) other minority groups

<p>   c/ PLP policy isaimed at creating the Maximalist Republic, a Republic
   for the people, by thepeople and of the people - as it should be! A
   mere change of ceremonial Head ofState would still leave Australia
   with a rigid and archaic constitution, anoutmoded political system and
   a grossly unequal society. This would be piecemealtinkering of the
   worst kind. The time has come to consider clear alternatives tothe
   federal form of government, the two-party system, the electoral system
   andthe scope of government. A Bill of Rights, constitutional
   protection of theenvironment and a conciliatory settlement of
   indigenous rights need to beincorporated in a Republican constitution.

 <p>  d/ The PLP has adopted theposition that a sovereign people naturally
   have the unfettered right to rewriteand replace their constitution if
   they believe this to be a requirement fortheir survival, prosperity
   and improvement of their democracy. The PLP holdsthat what has
   happened in Australia in recent years is like putting the cartbefore
   the horse.

<p>   Neither major party has a program for significant constitutional
   andpolitical change.

 <p>  e/ The notion thata government can be enterprising - and enabling -
   itself is the antithesis ofthe view that only private enterprise can
   deliver economic recovery, jobs andfuture prosperity for Australia.
   Many other countries, even those with asignificant private sector,
   have entirely government-owned or jointly-ownedpublic corporations to
   run key industries, e.g. France and Norway. As the PLP isof the view
   that Australia should aim at government enterprise rather
   thanprivatisation it becomes imperative to build real quality and
   independence intothe Government and Parliaments and to ensure that
   Government and Parliamentscease to be the servants of powerful
   multinational corporations and financiersin the private sector.

 <h>  The reformist strategy is dealt with inthree sections:

 <p>  SECTION 1: THE INADEQUACIES OF THE EXISTING POLITICAL SYSTEM;

<p>   SECTION 2: A MAXIMALIST MODEL FOR POLITICAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM
   INAUSTRALIA;

<p>   SECTION 3: DRAFTING THE NEW CONSTITUTION, - CONSTITUTIONAL CONTINUITY,
   -LAUNCHING THE NEW CONSTITUTION BY MEANS OF SECTION 128.

<h>  SECTION 1 TheInadequacies of the Existing Political System

 <p>  a/ The kind of question whichAustralians are now increasingly
   increasingly asking themselves in relation tothe Republic is: What
   kind of a Republic do we really want? If Australians canreconstruct
   their political system to meet the demands of a society
   vastlydifferent from Federation in 1900, having greatly advanced
   technology at itsdisposal and possessing superior transport and
   communication systems as well asphysical resources, how will they do
   it? Would there still be any need for afederal system at all? Or would
   it be a huge hindrance to effective government?Would there still be
   need a for some 830 politicians? Should they introduce atwo-tiered
   system of elected Government and enable the majority party orcoalition
   to select the Ministry from outside Parliament rather than
   appointcareer politicians? Surely the issue is no longer whether
   Australia should be aRepublic OR continue to be an outpost of a rather
   shaky constitutional monarchywhich has little interest in her distant
   Dominion. Improving the processes ofGovernment in Australia, steeped
   in 200 years British colonial and Westminstertraditions, is a task
   habitually avoided by both major parties. Unless it's doneAustralia
   may no longer in business on account of its antiquated constitutionand
   political system. More likely it will be governed by the Boards of
   Directorsof foreign Multi National Enterprises through a comprador
   class of well-paidcompliant Australian managers and politicians. That
   trend is unmistakablealready. The PLP intends to create a real
   democracy in Australia.

 <p>  b/ The domination by two majorparties has led to an erosion of
   democracy and to a weakening of Government,often described as "the
   passing of Parliament". The electoral systemhas kept that now sterile,
   male dominated, two-party system in place for far toolong. A greater
   variety of interests, persons and cultures should be representedin the
   National Parliament. The role of the citizens in constitutional
   changehas been minimal and tokenistic. The initiative and timing of
   referendums is theprerogative of the Government of the day. Almost
   every constitutional referendumturns into a political slanging match
   regardless of the merits of the proposal(s).Only eight of many such
   referendums have been successful over the 100 years offederation. The
   rejection of the four proposals of the 1988 referendumdemonstrated the
   present Constitution's dangerous inflexibility once again.Updating the
   Constitution has proven to be far too difficult. The result hasbeen to
   devise expensive ways to circumvent it, often unsuccessfully, a
   recipefor stagnation and deterioration.

 <p>  c/ The PLP'sanswer to these problems is that the piecemeal tinkering
   must end. Australiansneed to rewrite the entire constitution. The idea
   that the constitution cannotbe replaced by another one, supposedly
   because it can only be amended (and thenonly in terms of the highly
   unsatisfactory amending clause, section 128), is nomore than a legal
   fiction. It suggests that the legal system ultimately rulesAustralia
   rather than the people. This line of argument, frequently voiced
   byso-called constitutional experts, suggests that today's Australians
   are shackledby past agreements among some of the citizens who voted on
   the 1900 ConstitutionDraft in a VOLUNTARY referendum 100 YEARS AGO.

<h>  SECTION 2: A MaximalistModel for Political and Constitutional Reform in
  Australia

<p>   2a/ The phoney MinimalistRepublic 'debate' resulted in the
   Constitutional Convention of February, 1998.The Convention was
   dominated by conservative politicians, Minimalist candidatesof the ARM
   and the pro-monarchist candidates. However, a vocal minority
   ofMaximalist candidates presented the kind of arguments which are
   embodied in PLPpolicy as well. In addition, the Australian voters
   favour a directly electedPresident a fact that the conservative
   majority at the Convention found hard todeal with. We have
   incorporated that wish also in our policy.

 <p>  2b/ That policynow follows:
   
 <h>   A. Headof State to be directly elected by the Australian people.

 <p>  Head of State to have essentially symbolic powers, plus some reserve
   powersaimed essentially at breaking legislative deadlocks. In the
   event of legislativedeadlock the President convenes a joint sitting of
   Parliament where a majoritycan resolve the matter, or otherwise a
   referendum is called.

 <p>  The PLP does not favour the US-style Presidential system or a dual
   executivestructure (as for instance in France).

  <h>  B. The Prime Ministerwill remain the effective Head of Government.

 <p>  This official is the leader of the party or coalition of parties
   whichcommand majority support on the floor of the House of
   Representatives

 <h>   C. * The PLP is mostconcerned with the lack of quality in political
    executive government.

 <p>  We propose a democratisation and broadening of cabinet government
   inAustralia, including consideration of :

   <l> Inclusion of ministers with appropriate expertise and experience
       from outside of Parliament (as is the practice in most overseas
       countries);
 <l>  Nomination of ministers not only by the Prime Minister but also by
       unions and community organisations in their sphere of
       responsibility;
 <l>  Election of cabinet by the whole of parliament, instead of
       appointment by prime minister or factional leaders;
 <l>  Direct election by voters of all executive/cabinet positions;
 <l>  All ministers to be responsible to parliament, and subject to
       recall at any time.

 <h>  Ministerial Codes of Conduct

 <p>   We endorse the creation of codes of conduct for each Ministerial
   Departmentin order to enshrine a character of ethics and
   accountability to the decisionmaking processes and to ensure that the
   Universal Human Rights of the UN Charterand a concern for the welfare
   of all people becomes the fundamental basis forall policy making.

 <h>   D. Measures to end tothe domination of the National Parliament by two
    parties.

  <p>  The PLP calls for a referendum to introduce Proportional
   Representationby means of the Hare-Clark system based on multi-member
   electoral districts(these districts could be same as the
   administrative regions for localgovernments.)

 <p>  This would provide scope for the representation of more parties
   andIndependents - provided they would have minum support of, say, 4%
   or 5% in anine-member district. This would also end the single-member
   (district) system,pork barrelling, by-elections, neglected seats (safe
   seats), electoral boundarychanges and the adversarial mode of debate.

  <p>  The proportion of votes required for representation in a district
   would notbe able to be raised without a referendum or some other means
   of democraticconsultation. This is to ensure that major parties in a
   district cannot simplyvote together and raise the percentage without
   community consultation, in orderto reduce the representation of
   smaller rival parties and independents.

 <p>   A system of 30 electoral districts, each returning nine members, would
   yielda 270 member legislature (House of Representatives). Add to this
   three Senatorsper district (possibly not belonging to any party) and a
   total of 360 MPs wouldrepresent the nation in Canberra. That would be
   less than half the present totalnumber if the states are abolished.
   The Hare Clark system is well known inAustralia as it is used in
   Tasmania, the ACT, and for the present Senateelections. It is
   preferred over other PR systems, such as list PR systems andthe NZ MMD
   system of PR (based on the German system).

 <h>  The Senate would retain its present powersand functions.

  <p>  The Senate , already elected by PR - Hare Clarke now (although
   distortedby "malapportionment" on account of the federal system and
   staterepresentation) would retain its present powers and functions.
   However, in thePLP proposal Senators would not represent the abolished
   states. The principalfunctions of the Senate would be legislative
   review and holding Parliamentaryinquiries as at present. The PLP would
   remove the power of blocking Supply .

  <p>  The PLP favours the Robson Rotation system for PR (used in the ACT,
   andTasmania) with the right to discontinue the allocation of
   preferences beyond thenumber of vacant positions. the PLP supports
   Voter-determined Above-the-line orUnder-the-line Optional Preference
   Voting. Compulsory voting will be retained.

 <h>   E. The introduction of aFIXED four-year terms for the National Parliament
    and Government -

  <p>  with provision for optional early elections only if a Government has
   lostmajority support in the House of Representatives, and after
   exhausting alloptions of forming a new government under the existing
   parliament.

  <p>  Fixed-term parliaments are supported by many people but the major
   partieswon't take steps to introduce this reform once in power. The
   advantages arewidely accepted though. It provides time to implement
   policy and predictability.It reduces uncertainty and the frequency of
   elections.

  <p>  Change the electoral law or write it intothe new constitution.

  <h>   F. The creation of atwo-tier system of elected government with STRONG local
    government units.

 <p>   The present states could be replaced by smaller, administrative
   regionsindirectly elected by groups of local councils and/or on some
   BioRegionalprinciple. Special separate City Administrations could be
   established modelledperhaps on the Greater Brisbane Council.

  <p>This would reduce direct popularelections to two levels: the national
   and local levels.

 <p>   The regions could be grafted onto the local government tier. Already
   anextensive system of voluntary regional councils exists which could
   be a base tostart from. The savings of such measures have been
   estimated to be in the orderof many billions of dollars (possibly $30
   billion p.a., Drummond in Hall, 1998)depending on what model of
   regional administration is adopted. E.g. Drummond hasdeveloped
   detailed scenarios of such options by means of cost/benefit
   analysesbased on applications of linear regression techniques to
   State, Territory andLocal Government outlay as well as population
   data.

 <p>   The need for special regions to ensure representation for sparsely
   populatedoutlying areas is acknowledged and will be accommodated.

 <p>  Existing powers and responsibilities ofthe states would be
   redistributed between national and regional governingbodies.

  <p>  The PLP greatly favours the strengthening of local government, both
   interms of funding and functions. In order to effectively extend
   functionscritical mass needs to be achieved and some smaller local
   government units wouldneed to be amalgamated. Certain functions which
   are now the domain of stategovernments will be transferred to local
   government of sufficient size andcapacity to handle them. In addition,
   the PLP will introduce the precinct (orward) system to ensure maximum
   community involvement in local government - andgenerally promote
   grassroots democracy in every way possible.

  <p>  In 1900 an excellent case could be made for a federal structure. A lot
   haschanged since then. Communications and transport systems have
   improveddramatically. In 2000 a country of only 19 million people does
   not need afederal structure, seven different administrations plus that
   of the NorthernTerritory and ACT. All the reasons for federation have
   long disappeared!

 <p>   As a first step the PLP advocates the abolition of the state upper
   houses bymeans of state referendums - assuming that our priority No.
   1, the introductionof PR for state lower houses, has first been
   achieved. This would then befollowed by a campaign to abolish the
   states altogether.

 <h>   G. The introduction of aBill of Rights, including a preamble concerning the
    rights of Indigenous peopleand providing a conciliatory settlement with
    similar status and protection as aBill of Rights.

  <p>  The protection of human rights and special minorities will also be
   includedin a Bill of Rights.

<h>    H. The introduction ofnational environmental aims and safeguards

 <p>   together with ways of redress and compensation where a communityÂ¹s
   orindustry's livelihood is adversely affected.

 <h>   I. The amendmentprocedure for the new Constitution will be simple.

  <p>  The new Constitution can be amended in two ways:

 <p>   ONE: by a 3/4 majority of all National Parliamentarians of both Houses
   ofParliament voting jointly

 <p>   OR by a binding, mandatory national referendum which can be introduced
   in twoways:
 <l> Initiated by the Government of the day
 <l> Initiated by the people on the basis of a petition signed by 1% of
       the electors on the national electoral roll

 <h>  J. Review of Constitution procedure

  <p>  The new Constitution needs to be extensively reviewed after every five
   years.The review need to be given wide publicity and adjustment
   facilitated.

 <h> SECTION 3: Drafting theNew Constitution, - Constitutional Continuity, -
  Launching the New Constitutionby means of Section 128

 <h>   K. Who would draft theNew Constitution?

 <p>   The PLP recommends a panel of 50 persons representing various
   keyconstituencies of all age groups and all classes in society. These
   should be ina position to consult extensively with their
   constituencies . Politicians shouldnumber no more than five and
   constitutional experts would be equally limited tofive. There could be
   five foreign constitutional experts to provide input.

 <h>   L. Continuity

  <p>  It is desirable that the Constitution has a link with the old one
   andprovides continuity in spite of introducing radical changes. Many
   newConstitutions of national states have been the outcome of great
   political and/orsocial upheavals, major crises such as wars, a
   struggle for independence, civilunrest and secession. However, this
   does not mean that states which are notsubject to such major crises
   (a) therefore have no need for major changes to theground rules of
   their governmental system; (b) that such changes as are neededcannot
   be achieved in a civil, democratic and peaceful manner. After all
   majorcrises are almost always the result of inadequate, evolutionary
   adjustment.

 <p>   Moreover, the notion that Australia is free from crisis at present
   would bechallenged by many and denied only by the ultra conservative
   and foolhardy. Ithas become a very unequal country in recent decades
   with many pressing socialissues. In economic terms Australia is
   struggling to maintain its independenceand achieve greater
   competitiveness. International capital is increasinglydictating her
   destiny. Australia's present Constitution and political system
   hassevere constraints which, the PLP maintains, cannot be remedied by
   ineffectualpiecemeal tinkering at the margins.

 <h>   M. Launching the NewConstitution through Section 128 - an evolutionary
    method

 <p>   The principal problem in having a constitutional referendum accepted
   has beenthe requirement laid down in Section 128 that , apart from a
   national majority,there has to be "majority in a majority of states".
   Clearly thisrepresents a bias in favour of the federal system itself.
   In order to alleviatethis problem, an undemocratic feature of the
   present Constitution the cause ofmuch rigidity and expense, the
   following strategy is recommended:

 <p>   In a "New Constitution Referendum" there could be two questions
   inorder to overcome the "majority of states" problem, as follows:
 <l> For the purpose of voting on this New Constitution Package are you
       in favour of disregarding a requirement of Section 128 that a
       constitutional referendum needs to be carried by a majority of
       states? YES/NO
 <l> Do you support the proposition that the New Constitutional Package
       should replace the present Constitution in its entirety? YES/NO
