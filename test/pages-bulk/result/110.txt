<h> Slim Davis 1908-2002:"They got a right to live." 

      
<h>               Hummingbird Ranch, near Red Deer Alberta, 1996

<p>   Vast, indigo nights like this happen only in the Alberta foothills.
   Underfoot, bunchgrass and sage. Overhead, endless stars. Slim Davis
   and I wander in the twilight toward his back-forty, in  the direction
   of the western hills. From Daviss ranch, a few miles west of Red
   Deer,  the bulk of the Rockies rises 100 miles away, looking like the
   shoulders of some ancient sleeping behemoth. Up through the shadows
   sails an apparition. A dark equine shape, pony-size. She seems small
   by any standard. 
   
<h>   Slim Davis 1908-2002 :"They got a right to live, that's all."
   
<p>        Quiet, quiet. The mare steps through the dark. She whinnies her
   pleasure at Daviss familiar scent,  flinching  for a few seconds,
   unsure of my presence. Davis reaches out a reassuring hand, running it
   lightly up her side, over her mottled gray spots, up the quivering
   neck. Combing his fingers through the tangled shag on her neck, he
   whispers to me, in the darkness, These here are witches tails, these
   tangles. Theyre from when the witches ride em at night. Only the real
   wild ones have em. Thats how you tell.
   
<p>        Daviss wild mare is likely the only true mustang (Mustang - from
   the Spanish, monstrenco - roving, rough, wild) in captivity. True to
   her spirit, she escapes regularly, but she always comes back to him.
   The wild instinct is in her. I never did break her, he laughs.
<p>     The species the mare represents is typically small in stature, with
   a stocky build, large head and flowing mane and tail almost reaching
   the ground. Her kind are  plain rugged, hardly the Hollywood movie
   version of the Western horse. Their rough-cast stoutness is the very
   quality that has allowed them  to survive the fierce strenuousness of
   the Old West and the less picturesque cruelties of modern times.
<p>       Certain wildlife officials and sport hunters have claimed the wild
   horses of Western Canada are merely feral -  just  runaway packing
   horses from old logging and mining camps.
   
 <p>       But Daviss lean, scruffy ponies of the foothills are indeed the
   true item. His mustangs are the tough, rough mares and stallions of
   legendary Indian days, not at all like the bovine scrags  commonly
   called mustangs by some.
   
<p>        Unfortunately, Albertas population of feral  runaway horses hogs
   the public attention  that ought to go to the real mustangs. Most
   notably, the runaways roaming the fenced-in grasslands of CFB
   Suffield,  northwest of Calgary, have been made famous by highly
   publicized protests over a 1988  roundup. Protestors mistakenly called
   the heavy Suffield horses mustangs. In fact,  the feral horses of
   Suffield, with their mixed Shire,  Suffolk and Clydesdale bloodline,
   are no more mustangs  than Old Bessie. Their claim on Western heritage
   is dubious.
   
 <p>       If anyone knows the mustangs, Davis does. He has been their
   advocate for decades,  having been instrumental in persuading the
   Alberta government in 1974 to stop issuing seasonal licences to hunt
   them. Still, he says, Its something terrible what theyve done to them
   horses. Theres not too many left. Theyve been hunted and chased, and
   killed. Theyre scattered and gone. Nobody seems to care about the
   mustangs, says Davis, including even the Humane Society, who, he says,
   should do something about the condition in which horses often arrive
   at auction houses. Theyre too often delivered to auction bleeding,
   crippled, and blinded by  their frantic struggling against the leg
   snares hunters use to trap them, says Davis.
   
<p>       Davis, born in 1908 to a horsemans family, grew up  alongside the
   Blood, Blackfoot, Cree and Stoney Indians of  Alberta, peoples whose
   traditional history and culture began and ended  with the tough little
   mustangs of the wild.
   
<p>       In 1920,  Slim first encountered the wild ponies. In those days
   wild horses numbered in the tens of thousands in the Alberta
   foothills.  This ol Indian said  the little horses had been there as
   long as the Indians could remember, and probably long before, he said.
   
<p>       The Indians told him no one was certain where the  horses had come
   from, historically speaking, but they knew that the horses figured big
   in ancient legends.
   
<p>       The American West had once been a virtual wild horse dominion. As
   late as the turn of the 19th century, enormous herds of mustangs,
   possibly numbering in the millions,  roamed the prairies alongside the
   immense herds of buffalo. Indian Days were Mustang Days.
   
 <p>       The situation a century later is startling. Only a few hundred
   mustangs have survived the twentieth century, roving the  foothills of
   Alberta and B.C.
   
<p>   Today Western Canadas wild  horses are hunted, scalped, and skinned
   like muskrats.  Nature and history have colluded to make the remaining
   few mustangs the most aloof of creatures.  Their continued survival
   depends on their need to remain free. They literally cant survive in
   captivity, as they will themselves to die in  conditions of
   confinement or duress.

<p>        Modern archaeology looks to fossil remains from sediments in Wyoming
   suggesting that Equus Caballus, the horse, was native to North America
   60 million years ago. The  horse alternately appears and disappears
   from the fossil record at about one million year intervals. All trace
   of  the horse is lost by about 25,000 years ago. The species was
   unknown to the American continent when  Columbus sailed from Spain on
   his voyage of discovery.
   
 <p>      But  historians say that Columbus , and even the subsequent
   Spanish explorers, Coronado and DeSoto,  couldnt themselves have
   reintroduced the  lost species to North America. They argue that,
   although the earliest Spanish explorers did indeed bring horses with
   them to the New World, they brought only limited  numbers of the
   animals, and very few of those were mares.  Coronado, for example,
   wrote in his diary that he had brought five  hundred and fifty-eight
   horses, two of them mares. Two mares could hardly have stocked the
   whole  continent,  say historians.
   
<p>       More likely sources for the North American population of ponies,
   say historians, were stock-raising ranches established by the Spanish
   in the Santa Fe area between the 1550s and the 1700s. The ranches
   furnished ideal conditions for the spread of horses to the rest of the
   continent : friendly contact with the Indians through trade, an ample
   supply of horses, and plenty of opportunities for the Indians to study
   possible uses for the new creature.
   
<p>       Logically, the movement of horses into the North Americas would
   have followed established  inter- tribal trade routes. From Spanish
   records we know that, beginning around 1600, southwest tribes such as
   the Utes, Comanches, Apaches and Kiowas began raiding the Spanish
   ranches and stealing large numbers of horses. From those  tribes, the
   horses slowly spread across the continent. La Verendrye reported that
   tribes living northeast of the  Black Hills in Montana had no horses
   when he visited them in 1738. Yet just 16 years later in 1754 Anthony
   Henday, the Hudsons Bay Company explorer, met Assiniboines in the same
   area who had horses, though they used them only for packing, not for
   riding. By 1766 Henday reported numerous Assiniboines now skillfully
   riding the horses.
   
<p>       Several Indian tribes have oral traditions chronicling their first
   acquisition of horses : Tetons say they got theirs from the Arikaras;
   Shoshonis from Comanches, and Nez Perces from Shoshonis.
   In 1827 an American trader, Robert Meldrum, reported that old Crow
   people told him their generation was the  first generation of Crows to
   see horses.
   
<p>      So it was that the hardy Spanish ponies gradually populated the
   North American continent, as possessions of the native peoples.
       Wild herds of escapees were reported by the late 1800s, though
   they were mostly ignored by the Indians, as  domestic ponies were
   plentiful and easier to handle.
   
<p>       Eventually horse- stealing became the foremost means to  acquire
   more horses, and full blown horse culture was in full swing among the
   Indian tribes by the end of the century. The Indian pony - small,
   squat  and  tough -  became the mainstay of Indian life, indispensable
   in transport, warfare, leisure, hunting, religion and trade.     So it
   was practically inevitable that Indians began to measure wealth by the
   number of horses a man owned. The number of horses owned by individual
   Indians grew dramatically.

<p>       Among the Piegan people the horse-to-people ratio grew from about
   1-1 in 1860 to 3.5-1 by 1895. But a wealthy individual might easily
   have as many as 500 horses in his personal herd. In the Indian
   economy, if a man had a lot of horses, he had prestige, and could thus
   attract more wives, have more children, produce more meat and produce
   more trade goods. A man with a substantial herd was affluent.
   
<p>        The summer of 1886 was a hot one on the prairies, just 22 years
   before Slim Daviss birth in Carmangay, Alberta.  That year saw the
   last major horse-raiding party of the Old West. Canadian Piegans rode
   down out of the Calgary area to the Pryor Creek area of northern
   Montana. They made off with 60 horses stolen from the Crows camped
   there. To this day a mysterious herd of wild horses is known to exist
   in the Pryor Mountain area. Some Crows say these horses must be
   descendants of  the surviving stock of the Custer battle at Bighorn,
   which took place just a few miles away.
                                
 
<p>       Maddeningly, it is the argument over the bloodline of the wild
   horses that is used today by sport hunters and commercial hunters to
   rationalize their slaughter.What are you protecting anyway? asked
   Gerry Kemp, senior wildlife management biologist with the Alberta
   lands and forests  department in 1974. So-called wild horses are only
   the  descendants of work animals from farms, or lumbering or  mining
   operations that have been turned into the wild and  survived.The best
   thing that could be done with wild  horses would be to shoot em all
   said Kemp. 
  
<p>   Mustangs have, accordingly, been shot for target practice, bated with
   poison for predators, slaughtered for dog food, chased and tormented -
   subjected to every kind of maltreatment know to man. Objections have
   been raised  on the grounds of cruelty, but professional wild horse
   hunters shrug their critics off. Round em up, and shoot a tranquilizer
   into them, and those horses dont give a damn whether they end up as
   dog food or rodeo buckers, one big game hunter remarked to a Calgary
   reporter.
   
 <p>       In the 1950s, the slaughter reached high gear when hunters
   discovered that the horses could be panicked by dive-bombing
   airplanes. Terrified horses were buzzed from above, and raced
   cross-country until, at the point of exhaustion, they could be driven
   into corals. Frantic, the horses were  loaded into waiting trucks for
   transport to auction or slaughterhouses. Many would arrive at the
   slaughterhouse  already dead, trampled to death in transit. It was not
   an  uncommon sight to see the trucks dripping blood on the  highways.
   
<p>   Some of the trampled horses had simply dropped dead of fright.
   Mustangs have this peculiar will to die - so  sensitive and vulnerable
   are they to pursuit and capture.  Explorer David Thompson documented
   this  amazing vulnerability of mustangs as early as 1809. He wrote in
   his diary  while crossing the West that wild horses froze as if
   paralyzed when his men merely shouted a halloa and dashed at them. He
   was only the first of many horse  runners to report the phenomenon.
   Modern hunters still  observe that stallions, in particular, commonly
   seem  unable to survive the ordeal of being captured and will  to die
   within hours or days of being deprived of their  freedom. Whole bands
   have collapsed in paroxysms of fear  when subjected to the experience
   of being rounded up and corralled.
   
<p>      Chief  forester in 1959 , W.R. Hanson said, They [protesters] talk
   about inhumane  methods, or protest emotionally to the government
   against  the extinction of one of the features of the old wild
   west...[but] there is nothing cruel about the airplane  roundup. The
   only part you might have doubt about is the  loading of the frightened
   animals onto trucks.  Nevertheless,  the dive-bombing bloodbaths were
   brought to an end in 1959. Forest conservation officials felt
   pressured  by  public cries for more compassionate treatment of  the
   mustangs, and, magnanimously, decreed that roundup by cattle horse,
   not by dive-bombers,  was the only humane way to go.
   
<p>   The numbers of  mustangs has been in dispute for more than a century.
   A 1895 police census showed 42,257 wild horses on the range in
   Southern Alberta. In 1958 a roundup expert said huge tracts of Alberta
   land carried vast wild horse herds. The whole place is a wild horse
   kingdom, said Chester Utter in a report in The Albertan newspaper in
   August, 1958. Utter boasted that he alone had rounded up more than
   40,000 horses. One year later, in 1959, the Calgary Herald carried a
   front-page story saying the horses were facing extinction. The next
   year, 1960, the Alberta Cattlemens Association said there were some
   3,000 still roaming at will. By 1977, The Herald thought that about
   1,000 head of wild horses roamed the foothills. In 1991 Alberta Fish
   and Wildlife counted 300 mustangs roaming free in Kananaskis Country.
       
<p>	   In 1974, Calgary Socred MLA Art Dixon agreed with  the mid-70s
   figure of about 1,000, but argued that if  the annual hunt continued
   the horses would soon be wiped  out. Spurred on by Slim Davis and the
   thousands of names he had collected on a petition, Dixon successfully
   lobbied the Alberta legislature to  stop the regular issuing of
   hunting permits for wild horses.
   
<p>       With this regulatory move in 1974, horses roaming on  Crown lands
   in Alberta could no longer be legally hunted. But horses straying onto
   private lands were, and still are,  treated  as fair game for hunters,
   in season year- round.
   
 <p>      A private members bill passed by the Klein government in 1993
   making the capture of horses on public land more  than just a minor
   regulatory infraction  merely re-jigs the 1974 regulation. Mustangs
   that make the horrible mistake of straying onto private property are
   still legal prey for hunters in Alberta.
   
<p>      In B.C., in 1988 the Vancouver Sun reported three herds of
   mustangs ranging the Chilcotin district . The largest of the herds,
   the Red Brush herd, numbered 150. Two smaller herds, theBidwell and
   Haines Creek herds, were legally massacred in 1988, reducing their
   combined  numbers from well over 100 to 35. Regional wildlife
   officials authorized the 1988 roundup, claiming the horses  were
   reducing valuable grazing land during a severe  drought.
       
<p>	   Wild horse lovers passionately challenge hunters claims that most
   mustangs are  just feral rejects, not living descendants of heritage
   stock.
   
<p>   American wild horse advocate Hope Ryden attacked the  feral argument
   in the 1970s.  Ryden, who worked as   features producer for ABC News
   from 1966 to 1968, argued  persuasively in her book Americas Last Wild
   Horses  that the very fact that these horses have prevailed for so
   long against so many odds - hunters, bitter weather, rough  terrain,
   extensive grazing competition and high infant  mortality  - suggests
   that they must come from  exceptionally hardy stock, namely, the
   Spanish stock of  the original Indian ponies. Rejects from domestic
   herds, she argues, would never have survived over the years under
   such conditions.
   
<p>        It was the animal that was originally  the most Western that
   survived the harsh test of the  wild. The big, slow gentle farm horses
   and the high - strung, grain-fed horses were not creatures that could
   easily adapt to bleak habitats and rugged winters, wrote Ryden.
   
<p>       Ryden further warranted the purity of the mustang pedigree based
   on the fact that there has been no genetic  break in the continuity of
   the wild horse bloodline from the last century to this century. Since
   the West was opened, she pointed out, though the total  number of wild
   horses has dwindled drastically the wild  horse population did not at
   any time vanish. Therefore, she said, the mustang bloodline  extends
   perfectly from the 16th century to present day. From Columbus to Slim
   Daviss mare - one unbroken genetic heritage.

                             
 <p>      In one corner, romantics and  heritage advocates;  in the other,
   ranchers seeking to protect grazing  lands and hunters serving the
   horsemeat markets.  In the middle, a sparse population of
   excruciatingly shy broomtails roving the hills of Alberta and B.C. Are
   there only 300? One thousand? Thirty-five?
   
<p>       Really, Slim Davis sums it all up : I  spent a lot of time in the
   mountains in the last 50 years or so. The wildlife is nearly gone. Its
   four years since  I seen a mountain goat. There are some mountain
   sheep  left, but with all the trophy sheep huntin now, theyll  be gone
   soon, too. Now its the horses. They got a right   to live, thats all.


 <p>   One manager of a Calgary slaughterhouse that "processes" horseflesh
   confessed to the Calgary Albertan that he liked the little ponies.
   Still, he felt the slaughter was a necessary thing. Nevertheless, he
   admitted, Sometimes they look you in the eye and you wonder if you
   should pull the trigger. But its over in a second.
