      Motion Pictures and Sound Recordings of the Edison Companies, in
       American Memory, or view a Summary of Resources related to the

     <p>The film and audio recordings collected in Inventing Entertainment
   provide opportunities to chronicle the evolution of the motion picture
      industry and its influence on popular entertainment. Footage of
     vaudeville performers provides a catalyst to assess the demise of
      theatrical film during the early-twentieth century. Films of the
   Western genre can prompt a discussion on how certain styles transcend
   the media after entering the nation's cultural vocabulary. Additional
    films can be analyzed to discuss the merits of public executions and
    to research historic firsts in technology and popular entertainment.

                       <h>Chronological Thinking Skills

   <p>An August 1910 article on Thomas Edison, "Who's Who in the Film Game,"
   describes the motion picture camera as "the absolute foundation of an
     amusement business that encircles the world, giving employment to
   thousands and numbering its daily devotees by hundreds and hundreds of
     thousands." The Special Presentations, "The Timeline for Inventing
   Entertainment," and "The Life of Thomas Edison" provide an opportunity
   to chronicle the early history of the motion picture industry and the
      relationship between technology and the development of narrative
                                   forms.

   <p>The filmography, "Chronological Title List of Edison Motion Pictures,"
   features examples of motion pictures from the first three decades of
   the industry's history, beginning with the Dickson Greeting (1891).
   Non-fiction "actualities" of vaudeville performers, documentaries, and
   comic sketches featuring trick photography gradually gave way to
   longer narratives such as an adaptation of the fairy tale, Jack and
   the Beanstalk and original tales such as the famous Western, The Great
   Train Robbery (1903).

   <h>William Dickson's 1891 Greeting.

   <p>The motion picture industry of the early twentieth century provided an
    opportunity to create these new types of narratives but many studios
   based projects on the proven success of their competitors. The Special
    Presentation, "The History of Edison Motion Pictures," explains that
     competition often resulted in different studios remaking the same
   film. For example, How a French Nobleman Got a Wife . . . (1904) was a
     remake of the Biograph Studios film, Personal (1904), but Edison's
            picture became the most successful film of the year.
     <l>* How did competition and technological innovations in the motion
       picture industry influence the narratives of the films and
       establish certain genres?
     <l>* Why do you think that Edison's studio copied other studios' work?
     <l>* Do you think that copying other people's stories is a concern in
       the contemporary film industry?

          <h>Historical Comprehension: Vaudeville and Motion Pictures

     <p>Vaudeville was a popular stage entertainment in the United States
     during the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. Actors,
   singers, athletes, comedians, magicians, dancers, and other performers
     entertained middle-class audiences in theaters across the country.
    This collection features footage of vaudeville entertainers such as
      modern-day Hercules, Eugene Sandow, dancers such as the Leander
    Sisters and Carmencita , Venezuelan rope and slack wire walker Juan
   Caicedo, and the acrobatic comic duo, Robetta and Doretto. A search on
   the term, vaudeville, results in audio recordings of comic songs such
   as Gasoline Gus and His Jitney Bus and a variety of vaudeville films.

   <h>Uncle Josh dances with an onscreen performer in Uncle Josh at the
   Moving Picture Show. 
   <p>Film projectors entered vaudeville theaters in
   1896 and they eventually became the biggest attraction on the bill.
   While the comic film, Uncle Josh at the Moving Picture Show
   exaggerates people's reaction to the realism of the silver screen, it
   also demonstrates how theaters featured a variety of short films.
   Motion pictures such as The Enchanted Drawing and The Magician employ
   trick photography as a modern magic show, almost impossible to
   duplicate as a live stage performance. Meanwhile, documentaries such
   as the series of films depicting the aftermath of a cyclone in
   Galveston, Texas, including, Panorama of Galveston Power House and the
   Panoramic View of Tremont Hotel, Galveston displayed both the
   devastation of the area and the impressive ability of the motion
   picture camera to provide news images across the country.

       <p>A year later, footage of President William McKinley's funeral
    circulated the theaters in a similar series. (Additional themes are
       listed in the Special Presentation, "Overview of Edison Motion
                            Pictures by Genre.")

      <p>While vaudeville temporarily flourished by incorporating motion
    pictures in their programs, the film industry eventually took center
    stage as many vaudeville entertainers leapt to the silver screen and
    theaters were converted to accommodate movies. Additional films and
      other vaudeville materials are available in the American Memory
         collection, American Variety Stage: Vaudeville and Popular
                          Entertainment 1870-1920.

       and His Jitney Bus?
     <l>* Why do you think that so many vaudeville performers were featured
       in early films?
     <l>* What do you think were the potential benefits for audiences and
       motion picture distributors in featuring a vaudeville performance
       on film?
     <l>* How did vaudeville and other forms of popular entertainment
       influence the development of motion pictures?

       motion pictures?

         <h>Historical Analysis and Interpretation: The American West

     <p>During the nineteenth century, popular entertainment such as dime
    novels and stage plays established the Western genre while blurring
     the line between fact and fiction. For example, William Cody was a
    soldier, hunter, and Indian scout whose exploits were celebrated and
   exaggerated in Ned Buntline's Buffalo Bill dime novels. In 1872, Cody
     first portrayed Buffalo Bill on stage. He successfully adopted the
    public persona for future performances and later wrote his own dime
    novels and an autobiography about frontier life. He also established
                    "Buffalo Bill's Wild West" in 1883.

   <p>This troupe of cowboys, Native Americans, and other performers
   dramatized frontier life for audiences across the United States and
   Europe with skill-demonstrations and reenactments of buffalo hunts,
   armed conflicts, and traditional dances. A search on the term, wild
   west, yields films such as Buffalo Bill's Wild West Parade, Native
   American performances of the Buffalo Dance and the Sioux Ghost Dance
   and skill-demonstrations such as a cowboy riding a bucking bronco and
   sharpshooter Annie Oakley firing at targets in Edison's New Jersey
   studio. Additional images of Buffalo Bill's Wild West and other
   photographs from the era are available in the American Memory
   collection, History of the American West: 1860-1920.

   <h>Sharpshooter Annie Oakley performs in Edison's studio.

     <l>* How do the performances of Buffalo Bill's troupe depict life in
       the West?
     <l>* How do you think that audiences might have responded to the
       performers in Buffalo Bill's Wild West?
     <l>* How did Buffalo Bill's Wild West compare to other popular stage
       entertainments of the era such as vaudeville?
     <l>* How did the skills and feats of performers such as Annie Oakley
       and Native American dancers compare to their counterparts on the
       vaudeville stage?
     <l>* How did the performers in Buffalo Bill's Wild West compare to
       performers featured in the foreign village of the Pan-American
       Exposition of 1901?
     <l>* What does the employment of real Native Americans and cowboys
       contribute to these shows?
     <l>* After viewing some of the images in History of the American West:
       1860-1920, do you think that it was possible that Buffalo Bill's
       performance troupe influenced life in the frontier?
     <l>* How does the contemporary appeal of the Western genre in books,
       film, and television compare to the appeal of the Buffalo Bill's
       Wild West?

    <p>The traditions of the Western genre continued in early films such as
   The Great Train Robbery (1903), which Edison's motion picture catalog
   describes as the "faithful duplication of the genuine 'Hold Ups' made
    famous by various outlaw bands in the far West." In one of the most
   famous scenes from the movie, an outlaw fires his gun directly at the
    camera. Edison's catalog explains that the image can be used at the
    projectionist's discretion at either the beginning or the end of the
                         film for dramatic effect.
     <l>* What elements of the West was this film trying to dramatize? Do
       you think that this is an accurate depiction of frontier life?
     <l>* How does this film compare to contemporary Westerns?
     <l>* What do you think are the enduring elements of the Western genre?
     <l>* Why do you think that Westerns have been popular for more than a
       century?

 <h>Historical Issue-Analysis and Decision-Making: Historical Reenactments of
                                 Executions

     <p>This collection contains battle scenes from the Boer War of South
    Africa, the Spanish-American War, and the United States campaign in
   the Philippines. These historical reenactments provided an opportunity
       to capitalize on an audience's interest in news events without
         jeopardizing the safety of a cameraman and his equipment.

   <p>While films such as Capture of Boer Battery by British, Cuban Ambush,
      and Capture of Trenches at Candaba feature smoke effects and the
   occasional wounded soldier, none of the participants appear to die. A
     search on the term, execution, however, produces three historical
            reenactments in which death is the main attraction.

   <p>The film, The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots (1895), features the
   beheading of the sixteenth-century monarch as a "realistic
   reproduction of an historic scene" that greatly benefits from trick
   photography. In the midst of the Spanish-American War, Shooting
   Captured Insurgents (1898), depicted Cuban rebels struck down in a
   firing squad with the "flash of rifles and drifting smoke [making] a
   very striking picture." Three years later, eyewitness accounts were
   used to recreate the electrocution of President William McKinley's
   assassin in the Execution of [Leon] Czolgosz, with panorama of Auburn
   Prison.

   Execution of [Leon] Czolgosz, with panorama of Auburn Prison.

     <l>* What do you think was the purpose of each reenactment of an
       execution? How do you think that audiences might have responded to
       these reenactments?
     <l>* Do you think that there is a different intention in depicting a
       Spanish firing squad executing Cuban rebels and a U.S. prison
       executing a presidential assassin?
     <l>* Do you think that it is necessary to have some knowledge about the
       events surrounding an execution to appreciate the significance of
       each film? Do you think that the interest of such films reside in
       their historical significance or in the spectacle of death itself?
     <l>* What does the reenactment of an execution in a motion picture
       provide that might be lacking in portrayals through other media
       such as photography or prose?
     <l>* What are the detriments to presenting an execution in a motion
       picture?
     <l>* Do you think that there is a difference between viewing a
       reenactment of an execution and viewing such a reenactment as part
       of a larger work of fiction?
     <l>* What might these films imply about the role of capital punishment
       in early twentieth-century society?
     <l>* Do you think that people would watch a reenactment of a
       contemporary execution?
     <l>* Do you think that people would watch a live execution?

                      <h>Historical Research Capabilities

     <p>The essays in this collection describing the history of the Edison
   Cylinder Phonograph and Edison Motion Pictures provide an opportunity
   to further investigate the origins of both inventions. The collection
   also affords the opportunity to examine early experimental films such
    as the Dickson Greeting (1891), the Dickson Experimental Sound Film
   (1894) that combined a kinetoscope and phonograph, and the Panorama of
   Esplanade by Night (1901), which is alleged to be the first film taken
            at night by incandescent light in the United States.

     <p>In addition to technological firsts, some films in this collection
       provide scenes of other historic firsts in the United States,
      including the first annual Automobile Parade (1899) in downtown
   Manhattan, President McKinley taking the Oath to become the first U.S.
    president of the twentieth century, and Coney Island's establishment
                        as the first amusement park.

   <h>Rube and Mandy getting off of the Coney Island train ride. 
   <p>Coney Island was a popular recreation area in the late-nineteenth century.
   It featured three race tracks, the nation's first roller coaster in
   1884, a Ferris Wheel a decade later, and the first enclosed amusement
   park in 1895. Subsequent attractions followed and Coney Island
   developed into an historic entertainment area. A search on the term,
   Coney Island, yields films from the park's first decade. Shooting the
   Chutes (1896) features the park's water slides, Racing at Sheepshead
   Bay (1897) presents one of the area's three racetracks, and Rube and
   Mandy at Coney Island, (1903) features the rides found in Steeplechase
   Park and Luna Park. (Luna Park was the creation of the duo of Frederic
   Thompson and Elmer Dundy who created the "Trip to the Moon" ride at
   the Pan-American Exposition of 1901.)
