                                 <h>biography
     <p>Glass (b. 1937), along with Steve Reich, La Monte Young, and Terry
    Riley, helped shape the minimalist movement. His highly recognizable
    style has won Glass wide critical and commercial acceptance. Glass's
   music is marked by its repetitions and bright keyboard figures, and he
        has made important inroads into scoring music for films and
         unconventional operas. Here are his essential recordings.
                          <h>recommended recordings 
   <h>Glass: Einstein On The Beach / Michael
                                  Riesman

      <p>Although Einstein on the Beach is by definition an opera, Philip
   Glass's most famous work also transcends traditional music categories.
   Glass avoided all vestiges of plot in the piece and dug deep into his
    quiver of repetitions to create an artfully unnerving five hours of
     brilliance. The instrumental ensemble never exceeds five members,
    playing electric keyboards, saxophones, flutes, and a single violin.
    Furthermore, the music congregates around the upper registers, often
                      darting through its...

       <h>Koyaanisqatsi (1998 Re-recording)
                                [SOUNDTRACK]
                                <h>Philip Glass        
      <p>Fifteen years after its initial release, Philip Glass's score to
     Godfrey Reggio's film Koyaanisqatsi is still as timeless as it was
     meant to be. Glass's epic score, virtually the only sound in this
   non-narrative movie, accompanied an exhilarating, wordless meditation
        of images ranging from expansive, slow-motion landscapes to
   whirling-dervish city scenes shot using time-lapse techniques. Glass's
   music was a perfect match. The opening chant is still unlike anything
                 Glass has composed, a Tibetan...

					  <p>This is an extraordinary retelling of the classic story "The Beauty
    and the Beast", this time based on the Jean Cocteau film La Belle et
   la Bete. Philip Glass, one of our reigning minimalists, studied under
    Darius Milhaud and Nadia Boulanger in Paris and his music has always
     had a quiet Debussy-like character to it. What is amazing is that
   Glass is one of the minimalists who have made a successful transition
         into opera (John Adams is the other). And catch the scary
                       silent-movie-house...

          <h>Glass: Music With Changing Parts / Philip Glass Ensemble
                           <h>Composer: Philip Glass
                      <h>Ensemble: Philip Glass Ensemble
             <h>Wea/Atlantic/Nonesuch - #79325 / February 1, 1994
                      
   <p>Philip Glass's early works have purely functional titles, and this one
    is no exception. His masterpiece in this repetitious and rigorously
   structural composition style-- Music in Twelve Parts--may be just too
    much for some people to take. If so, then this disc may be just the
    ticket. Of course, Glass's many fans will snap it up as a matter of
   course, but as the title implies, there's somewhat more happening here
   than in his very first minimalist works--just enough so that newcomers
                          to the style...

   <p>Glassworks remains Philip Glass's bestseller from the middle period of
         his career, the recording by means of which many listeners
    familiarized themselves with his music. Conceived as a thematically
    whole instrumental studio album taking advantage of the promotional
    and marketing capabilities of what was then Glass's new major label
   (CBS, now Sony Classical) and targeted at consumers intrigued with his
    newfound notoriety, Glassworks features six parts (three per side on
                      the original LP and...
