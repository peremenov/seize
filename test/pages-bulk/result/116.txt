<h>Masters and Workers:
Labour relations in ancient Egypt

       <p>The demotic maxims in Ankhsheshonq's Instruction sum up the
   attitude of the upper classes toward the working people:

     <p>Give one loaf to your laborer, receive two from (the work of) his
     arms.
     Give one loaf to the one who labors, give two to the one who gives
     orders. 

                                          <h>The Instruction of Ankhsheshonq
                 <h>M. Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Literature, Vol. 3, p.176

   <p>Not much has changed during the last few millennia.

<h>The master: a self-image of benevolence

         <p>Treat your dependents well, in so far as it belongs to you to
     do so; and it belongs to those whom Ptah has favored. If any one
     fails in treating his dependents well it is said: "He is a person .
     . ." As we do not know the events which may happen tomorrow, he is
     a wise person by whom one is well treated. When there comes the
     necessity of showing zeal, it will then be the dependents
     themselves who say: "Come on, come on," if good treatment has not
     quitted the place; if it has quitted it, the dependents are
     defaulters. 

                                <h>The Precepts of Ptah-Hotep, ca. 2200 BCE

       <p>The High Priest of Amen Rome-roi saw himself in the role of the
   benefactor of his servants, after he had renovated the bakery and was
   not sparing with self praise

         <p>Oh priests, scribes of the House of Amen, servants of the holy
     sacrifices foremost, bakers, brewers, pastry cooks, all of you
     entering through the gates of this workshop in the House of Amen,
     remember me fondly, praise my name for my good deeds, for wise I
     was.
         <p>I found this room and it was about to crumble, the woodwork was
     decaying, the lintels made of wood had fallen down and disappeared
     similar to the painting covering the reliefs. I restored it all,
     wider than it had been, tall and big. I put in lintels made of
     sandstone, I made openings of real cedar wood. I turned it into a
     spacious workshop for the bakers and brewers entering it. I made it
     better than it had been, in order to protect the servants of my
     god, Amen-Re. 

       <p>Beken-khonsu, another priest, had a similarly high opinion of his
   own achievements

         <p>I was a beloved father to my subordinates. I taught the young
     wisdom and knowledge. I stretched my hand out to the miserable. I
     gave the needy sustenance. I did useful deeds in his temple as the
     chief official of works at Luxor on behalf of ... Ramses II. 

                                               <h>Inscription of Bekenkhonsu

       <p>Ahmose, a New Kingdom scribe took a personal interest in the fate
   of at least one of his servants. He wrote to his superior Ti

         <p>What Ahmose belonging to Peniati says to his master, the
     treasurer Ti: Why was my servant girl, which was with me, taken
     away and given to another? Am I not your servant obeying your
     instructions night and day? Let her payment, as far as I am
     concerned, be taken, as she is still young and does not know yet
     what work is. May my master order, that her work be done just as
     that of any servant girl of my master.
     For her mother has sent me the following message: 'You have let my
     child be taken away, while she was with you. But I did not object
     to my master, as she was with you as a child.' Thus she spoke to
     me, protesting. 

                                                     <h>Papyrus Louvre 3230b
                                           <h>My translation from the German

       <p>Children were thus given into service at an early age, before they
   could be expected to do work. It is unclear from this letter whether
   the parents had to pay for her upkeep during this period or whether
   she was paid even at this age.

<h>The voice of the workers

       <p>Often abused, the ancient Egyptian worker still tried to improve
   his lot. A Middle Kingdom story includes the following passage:

     <p>There was a boss (TAz.w - commander) who [commanded (?)] the
     workers. These workers said to him: "It is nice to make bread for
     you (and) pleasing to make [/// ///] for you. But what will you do
     for us?" 

              <h>A fragment from the Tale of Neferpesedjet, pUC 32156A Recto
          <h>After the transcription and German translation on the Thesaurus
                                                Linguae Aegyptiae website

<h>Co-workers

       <p>Having to deal with lazy workers did not just anger the people
   they were supposed to be working for, but also those who had to work
   with them. After doing his father Ma'a-nakhte-ef a favour, his son
   Pa-baky who, as a scribe responsible for the efficiency of his staff,
   was clearly unhappy with the labourer he had been sent:

     <p>The scribe Pa-baky speaks to his father the draughtsman
     Ma'a-nakhte-ef.
     To the effect that: I heeded what you said to me, 'Let Ib work
     together with you!' Now look, he spends the day bringing the jar of
     water. There is no (other) chore for him every single day. He does
     not listen to your counsel which says to him, 'what have you done
     today?'
     Look, the sun has set and he is far away (with) the jar of water.

<h>Protest

   <h>Supervisors leading peasants, (2500 BCE) Louvre, Paris     
   <p>Ancient
   Egypt was a stable, conservative society with a well developed class
   system and people were treated according to their standing, with
   blatant inequalities deeply ingrained in tradition. But tradition also
   set limits to the amount of work one could reasonably expect from
   one's workers and if the work quotas were seen as exaggerated (for
   whatever reason), it caused resentment and resistance. Thus the
   Hebrews voiced their protest:

     <p>10     And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their
     officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh,
     I will not give you straw.
     <p>11     Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: Yet not ought of
     your work shall be diminished.
     ...
     <p>16     There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to
     us, Make bricks: and behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault
     is in thine own people. 

                                                           <h>Genesis, 5 [1]

       <p>We know only of a few instances of workers complaining before the
   first millennium BCE. Under the Ptolemies, on the other hand, workers'
   protests were quite frequently put in writing: In 255 BCE for
   instance, a gang of Greek quarry men felt that they were unjustly
   exploited by their foreman. They complained to the architect:

     <p>To Kleôn the architect, greeting.
     We who belong to the original quarry-men from the place of
     embarcation are being wronged by Apollônios the ganger. He having
     set us to work at the hard rock and having selected us as against
     the rest, has shown (us only) the soft rock that he has (in the
     quarry), and now we are ruined, spoiling (our) iron (to no
     purpose); therefore we pray you that we may obtain justice; having
     cut the hard rock .... that we be not injured.
     Farewell. 

                                            <h>A. H. Sayce: The Greek Papyri
                          <h>in Petrie: Illahun, Kahun and Gurob, 1891, p.38

<h>Strikes

       <p>The treatment corvée workers received from their employer, the
   pharaoh i.e. the state and its officials, was to a large extent
   dependent on the economic and political stability of the country. In
   his Great Edict Horemheb tried to curb some of the excesses of the
   system. But ordinary workers in full-time state employ were also put
   upon. When corruption and inefficiency towards the end of the reign of
   Ramses III had made the country barely governable and the workers in
   the necropolis of Medinet Habu had not received their food rations,
   they organized the first recorded strike in history (year 29 of
   Ramses' reign).
       <p>Food was generally doled out once a month and was often barely
   adequate. When they ran short the workers declared

     <p>We are starving to death. Another eighteen days remain until the
     beginning of the new month. 

       <p>Then they assembled all in one place, near a stela

     <p>We will not return. Tell this to your taskmasters who are assembled
     there, at that place. 

       <p>The hungry crowd approached the storehouses, but did not force the
   doors. One of them spoke up

     <p>We are starving hungry. Our tongue wasted away in thirst. No cloth
     is left. We are lacking oil. We have no fish, not even vegetables.
     Send to Pharaoh our master, send to the king our ruler, so that he
     may give us sustenance. 

       <p>He repeated their complaint in front of the officials, but his
   comrades feared for him and agreed that in the end all would be well.
   Others refused to disperse unless they received their rations
   immediately. The officials considered this and called a clerk to

     <p>Check the corn you have received and give from it to the men of the
     necropolis.
     
     <p>And Pe-montu-nabiat was brought and we received a ration of grain
     every day. 

<h>The treatment of the workers

       <p>Subordinates were at times less than zealous in the performance of
   their duties. Threats, outspoken or veiled were used to keep them on
   their toes

     <p>The mayor of the southern capital Sennefer speaks to the
     tenant-farmer Baki son of Kyson to the following effect. This
     letter is brought to you to tell you that I am coming to see you
     when we moor at Hu in three days' time. Do not let me find fault
     with you in your duties. Do not fail to have things in perfect
     order. ..... You are not to slack, because I know that you are
     lazy, and fond of eating in bed. 

                       <h>Sennefer, mayor of Thebes, to his tenant, Baki 
                                                     <h>Papyrus Berlin 10463
                                    <h>Reign of Amenhotep II (1450-1412 BCE)

       <p>A wise underling accepted his place in the order of things. Any, a
   scribe in the palace of queen Nefertari, knew how hierarchies work:

     <p>Do not talk back to an angry superior,
     Let him have his way;
     Speak sweetly when he speaks sourly,
     It's the remedy that calms the heart.
     Fighting answers carry sticks,
     And your strength collapses;
     ///////////////
     Do not vex your heart.
     He will return to praise you soon,
     When his hour of rage has passed.
     If your words please the heart,
     The heart tends to accept them;
     Choose silence for yourself,
     Submit to what he does. 

                           <h>The Instruction of the scribe Any, New Kingdom
               <h>M.Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Literature, Volume II, p.143

       <p>Servants whose master was displeased with them, were punished or
   sacked, as Heqanakhte did in his letter to his children

     <p>Now, be sure to have the maid Senen thrown out of my house - take
     great care of this - the very day Sihathor returns to you [with
     this message]. Listen, if she spends one more day in my house. But
     it is you who let her do evil to my new wife. Look, why must I
     scold you? 

                                                <h>Letter by Heqanakhte [4],
                                                           <h>Middle Kingdom

       <p>The corvée system caused much hardship at times. Being late for
   work or trying to leave early was a severe offense. Laws concerning
   desertion called for six months' imprisonment, forced labour or a
   fine. The imprisonment at Thebes of a woman for leaving her district
   in order not to do her corvée service is mentioned in a Middle Kingdom
   papyrus now at the Brooklyn Museum. But special circumstances, like
   illness in the family, were often taken into consideration.
       <p>Another papyrus in the Brooklyn Museum describes how Menemnakht
   was away for a rather long time doing his duty, and his family was
   forced to work the farm without him. In their letters they complained
   about the poor inundation, and Menemnakht replied describing the
   inadequate rations he received and the difficult work he had to do.
       <p>Workers were generally drafted during the time of inundation, when
   work in the fields was impossible. Much of the work done was in their
   direct interest such as the repair of dams and irrigation canals, and
   vicariously, the building of temples as places where the gods were
   worshipped by priests in their name and holidays were celebrated or
   the erection of pyramids, tombs and palaces for the pharaohs.

     <p>Kheops ... brought the people to utter misery. For first he closed
     all the temples, so that no one could sacrifice there; and next, he
     compelled all the Egyptians to work for him. To some, he assigned
     the task of dragging stones from the quarries in the Arabian
     mountains to the Nile; and after the stones were ferried across the
     river in boats, he organized others to receive and drag them to the
     mountains called Libyan. They worked in gangs of a hundred thousand
     men, each gang for three months. For ten years the people wore
     themselves out building the road over which the stones were
     dragged, work which was in my opinion not much lighter at all than
     the building of the pyramid 

                                         <h>Herodotus, Histories II, 124 [2]

       <p>Workers, while sometimes neglected or beaten, were not considered
   to be expendable, and their welfare was important to their
   supervisors. The leader of a quarrying expedition to the desert,
   reported proudly, that he had lost neither man nor mule [6]. The need
   for days of rest was also recognized. The Egyptian week of ten days
   ended, according to Deir el Medineh papyri, often in a two day
   weekend. Workers did not work on the main religious holidays either,
   and the five intercalary days not belonging to any month (the year was
   divided into 12 months of thirty days each, leaving five days) were
   considered unlucky and no work was to be done during that period.

       <p>Absences from work were carefully noted and their reasons given

     <p>Pendua: first month of the season of inundation, 14th day: he went
     drinking with Khonsu ....
     Amenemuia: the month of the winter season, 15th day: assisted at
     the mummification of Hormes. 2nd month of winter, 7th day: absent.
     8th day: brewed beer. 16th day: worked at reinforcing the door....
     Seba .... a scorpion stung him ....
     Khonsu .... three days given here ... ill. [Then another day when
     he] served his god. The month of inundation, 14th day: his feast.
     15th day: his feast.

<h>Corporal punishment

   <h>Worker being punished, from the tomb of Menna

                  
                                  Source: L.Casson Ancient Egypt, excerpt

       <p>Corporal punishment of workers was commonplace and seen, at
   least by some employers, as an inevitable part of existence and likely
   to be part of the next life as well, just as the decorator of Menna's
   tomb depicted it. Foremen and supervisors did not escape being beaten
   either, if they were seen to have been slack in their duties.

     <p>14     And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's
     taskmasters had set over them, were beaten and demanded, Wherefore
     have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and
     to day, as heretofore? 

                                                            <h>Exodus, 5 [1]

       <p>A person was probably never far from a beating if the mortuary
   inscription of Nedjemib is anything to go by, as he specifically
   mentions never having been beaten by officials, a certification of
   good conduct which the gods should take into account

     <p>... Let a mortuary offering of that which is with you come forth to
     me, for I was one beloved of the people. Never was I beaten in the
     presence of any official since my birth; never did I take the
     property of any man by violence; (but) I was a doer of that which
     pleased all men. 

           <h>Excerpt from the mortuary inscription of Nedjemib, Old Kingdom
              <h>James Henry Breasted Ancient Records of Egypt Part I, § 279

<h>Abuse and harassment

       <p>Servants and subordinates enjoyed a certain measure of protection
   from abuse. According to an ostracon [3] an official investigation was
   held at Deir el Medine against a workman accused of having abused a
   maidservant. But retaliation to violence dealt out by a superior was
   generally not seen as self-defense but as a crime, and in the case of
   Moses, born and raised in Egypt, murder. Moses was well aware of this
   fact [1].

     <p>11     And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown,that
     he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he
     espied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.
     <p>12     And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that
     there was no man, he slew the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. 

                                                            <h>Exodus, 2 [1]

       <p>Cases of sexual harassment in ancient times are known, though only
   from fiction. In real life the down-trodden had rarely the opportunity
   to leave enduring testimony of their misery. Above all female servants
   and slaves must at times have had a hard time.
       <p>In the tale of The Two Brothers, Anpu's wife tries to seduce her
   husband's brother Bata and when she doesn't succeed accuses Bata of
   having assaulted her. Similarly, the biblical Joseph got into hot
   water with his Egyptian master. His position was made especially
   difficult by the fact that he was a slave to Potiphar and unable to
   leave his household.

     <p>7     ... his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she
     said, Lie with me.
     <p>8     But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my
     master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath
     committed all he hath to my hand.
     <p>10     And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that
     he hearkened not unto her to lie by her or to be with her.
     <p>11     And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into
     the house to do his business, and there was none of the men of the
     house there within.
     <p>12     And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and
     he left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth.
     <p>14     And she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto
     them, saying, See, he hath brought in a Hebrew unto us to mock us;
     he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice.
     <p>20     And Joseph's master took him, and put him into prison. 

                                                          <h>Genesis, 39 [1]

       <p>In the end, luck and ability got him out of gaol and he rose to a
   position of great wealth and power, similar to a number of
   non-fictional Asiatics who were appointed to high offices.
