                           <h>Faculty Senate minutes

                             <h>TO THE MEMBERS OF
                            THE ACADEMIC COUNCIL
                            THIRTY-THIRD SENATE
                                <h>Report No. 6
     _________________________________________________________________

                        <h>SUMMARY OF ACTIONS, JAN. 25
     _________________________________________________________________

   <p>At its meeting on Thursday, January 25, 2001, the Senate of the
   Academic Council heard reports and took the following actions:

   <l>1. Upon recommendation of the Committee on Undergraduate Studies, and
   by unanimous voice vote, approved the initiation of the
   Interdisciplinary Program in Archaeology and authorized the Executive
   Committee of the Interdisciplinary Program in Archaeology to nominate
   candidates for the B. A. degree for a period of five years, from
   September 1, 2001 through August 31, 2006.

   <l>2. Accepted the 1999/2000 Annual Report of the Committee on Academic
   Computing and Information Systems, as presented by past committee
   chair Professor Brad Osgood.

                                                       <h>SUSAN W. SCHOFIELD

                                     <h>Academic Secretary to the University
     _________________________________________________________________

                              <h>MINUTES, JAN. 25
     _________________________________________________________________

   <h>Call to Order

   <p>Senate Chair Brad Osgood called the meeting to order at 3:24 p.m. in
   Room 180 of the Law School. There were 31 voting members, 8 ex-officio
   members, and a large number of guests in attendance. Osgood welcomed
   new School of Education Dean Deborah Stipek to her first Senate
   meeting, and she was greeted with a round of applause.

   <h>Approval of Minutes

   <p>The minutes of the January 11, 2000 meeting of Senate XXXIII
   (SenD#5159) were approved as submitted. The Chair advised that the
   Memorial Resolution on the agenda was being rescheduled to the next
   meeting.

   <h>Report from the Senate Steering Committee

   <p>Osgood thanked those at SLAC for the very successful Senate meeting
   and tour on January 11th. He joked that if the next Senate "field
   trip" couldn't be to Hawaii, he might try to arrange for the Athletic
   Director to take everyone to the Final Four. Osgood informed Senate
   members that their Fall Quarter discussion on advising had led to the
   recent activation of the C-US Subcommittee on Residential Education
   and Advising (S-REA). It had been charged among other things to
   "develop strategies for faculty mentoring of freshmen and sophomores"
   and to "plan a program to increase the quality of mentoring at the
   upper levels." The subcommittee, chaired by Professor Elizabeth
   Bernhardt, includes faculty members Brad Gregory (History), Lynn
   Hildemann (Civil and Environmental Engineering), Doug Osheroff
   (Physics), Senior Lecturer Julie Kennedy (Earth Systems), three
   students, and three ex-officio staff members. Osgood indicated that
   Director of Undergraduate Advising Lori White welcomed the assistance
   of the subcommittee as well as input from any and all faculty members.

   <p>The Chair also reported that the Executive Committee of the Planning
   and Policy Board, consisting of himself and former Senate Chairs
   Zoback and Efron, had considered suggestions for potential PPB topics,
   but had decided not to convene PPB starting in the Fall. He said that
   they anticipated the possibility of PPB being appointed later in the
   year in connection with the results of the Provost's University Needs
   Assessment process, and that they welcomed other faculty suggestions.
   Osgood previewed upcoming Senate agenda items, and reminded everyone
   of the annual meeting of the Academic Council on March 8th. Vice
   Provost Bravman asked what purpose was served by the "always empty
   Action Calendar" on the agenda. The Academic Secretary explained that
   degrees are conferred quarterly under the Action Calendar, as well as
   occasional other items, which are to be voted on as presented, without
   amendment.

   <h>Report from the Committee on Committees

   <p>CoC Chair Lipsick advised that they had responded to the Provost's
   request for faculty members to serve on a small, ad hoc committee to
   review the maternity provisions of the tenure policy. CoC had also
   begun its regular work of identifying potential members for Fall 2001
   vacancies on various committees, he said, and urged faculty members to
   say yes if asked to serve.

   <h>Reports from the President and the Provost

   <p>The Provost was absent. President Hennessy reported with relief that
   he had filled three major administrative positions. He said that
   "Acting" had been removed from General Counsel Debra Zumwalt's title,
   following the recommendation of a blue ribbon panel that examined the
   position. LaDoris Cordell would be assuming the post of Vice Provost
   and Special Counsel to the President for Campus Relations, Hennessy
   said, returning to Stanford after 19 years as a Santa Clara County
   judge. And he announced that Randy Livingston would arrive in
   mid-March as Chief Financial Officer and Vice President for Business
   Affairs.

   <p>President Hennessy also spoke briefly about the California utilities
   crisis, explaining that Stanford has a Cogeneration plant, owned and
   operated by a third party, that provides power to its academic
   facilities and that sells back excess power into the PG&E grid. "In
   addition to avoiding rolling blackouts, we are part of the solution
   rather than part of the problem," he said. The university urges all
   members of the community to evaluate their usage of electricity and to
   try to conserve it, making as much power as possible "available to our
   neighbors and the rest of the state." Hennessy indicated that
   Stanford's energy usage had gone up steadily for several years, and
   that dramatic increases in natural gas and electricity prices would
   probably result in a $5 million hit to the university budget. He
   encouraged anyone with ideas about ways to conserve energy to contact
   Chris Christofferson, Associate Vice Provost for Facilities
   (725-0296). Dean Orr (School of Earth Sciences) and Professor Noll
   (Economics) joked that Stanford could close down every Friday and get
   rich by selling electricity at "extortionist prices." Hennessy said
   that unfortunately the university had a long-term agreement that did
   not include Stanford sharing in any profits.

   <p>Professor Rehm (Drama) advised the Senate of the formation of an
   informal committee of Senators including himself, Debra Satz, David
   Abernethy, Rob Polhemus, Yvonne Yarbro-Bejarano, David Palumbo-Liu,
   Bernie Roth and ASSU President Seth Newton, who wished to meet with
   the President and the Provost about the Nike contracts with Stanford.
   He mentioned labor problems at Nike factories, student protests at
   several universities, a citizen lawsuit supported by California
   Attorney General Lockyer, and several recent books and articles about
   college athletics. "All of this puts some pressure on Stanford to
   justify its continuing to contract with Nike," he said. He also made
   "a modest proposal" that if Stanford needs money so badly that it has
   to sell advertising on student athlete uniforms, maybe it ought to
   approach Nike and Adidas and Reebok and "cut a similar deal" for
   clothing that all the faculty would wear, like the students. Hennessy
   reminded everyone that the university does not fund any varsity
   sports, and that Athletics is stretched to cover its budget
   commitments since advertising was removed from venues such as Maples
   Pavilion. He said that he is concerned that corporate sponsorship
   confuses the notion of amateur sports at the college level, but also
   recognizes that it is a reality to be contended with. He noted that
   Nike had kept Stanford apprised of labor issues, and he suggested that
   engaging with them about such issues might cause them to pay more
   attention to them. Hennessy asked Rehm and the group to meet with
   Athletics Director Ted Leland to inform themselves about athletic
   sponsorship agreements and relevant issues, adding that "we will be
   happy to meet with any faculty who are concerned." Hennessy noted that
   he had read the books Rehm mentioned, and recommended the book by
   William Bowen and James Schulman, The Game of Life: College Sports and
   Educational Values

   <h>New Interdisciplinary Program in Archaeology (SenD#5149)

   <p>Chair Osgood commented that the new interdisciplinary program
   recommended by the Committee on Undergraduate Studies draws on
   existing faculty strengths in Classics, Anthropology, and Geology, and
   reflects considerable student interest. He welcomed C-US Chair Hester
   Gelber to present the recommendation, along with guests including H&S
   Associate Dean Russell Berman and Professors Ian Morris (Classics),
   Ian Hodder (Cultural and Social Anthropology), Gail Mahood (Geological
   and Environmental Sciences), and John Rick (Anthropological Sciences),
   all members of the program's executive committee.

   <p>Gelber advised that C-US had received a recommendation to initiate the
   program from the Humanities and Sciences Curriculum Committee and
   deans. After discussing the degree of support available from the
   relevant departments, the curriculum, provisions for advising, and the
   general quality of the program, they found it to be impressive and
   well thought through, she said. Berman added that H & S firmly
   supports the proposal, which emanates from the Archaeology Center,
   funded in 1998/99 by seed money from the President's Fund. He advised
   that H & S was prepared to provide base budget support as it came to
   better understand the size of student interest.

   <p>Professor Palumbo-Liu (Comparative Literature) offered several
   comments, including a suggestion that the foreign language requirement
   should be set at "B" rather than "B minus." He also asked about
   financial arrangements for required fieldwork, encouraged more of an
   emphasis on Asia and the Pacific Rim, and suggested that the important
   course on ethics expand its focus to include "the effects of conquest
   and imperialism." Co-Directors Morris and Hodder noted that fieldwork
   is a central part of archaeology. It was being arranged either on the
   Stanford campus with very low cost to students, or at overseas sites,
   funded in different ways, but generally not burdening students
   financially, except perhaps in lost opportunities for summer wages.
   They agreed that they would very much like to become involved in Asia,
   "if only we can come up with a couple more faculty billets." Hodder
   indicated that broad attention to various ethical dimensions of
   archaeology in the modern world would be explored in his course.
   Professor Shoven (Economics) said that he believed the Senate should
   not be in the business of deciding specific grade requirements for
   courses within a program.

   <p>Professor Noll (Economics) commented that he strongly supported the
   new program, but was disappointed with two aspects of the proposal.
   First, he expressed the view that core courses should be offered every
   year, not every other year, given the propensity of Stanford students
   to have diverse interests and commitments off campus that could lead
   to scheduling problems in the major. Second, he said it appeared to
   him that students would be able to fulfill the major without actually
   acquiring interdisciplinary breadth. He suggested that breadth should
   be required in both the analytic methods and the skills courses. "I
   would think that this program might want to produce a new kind of
   geologist, or a new kind of classicist, or a new kind of
   anthropologist, who was actually very skilled in those other fields,"
   Noll observed. Mahood said she expects students to be attracted to the
   program at least in part because of dimensions beyond anthropology,
   such as earth sciences. She said that the program committee would be
   thinking about further constraints in the major as student interests
   become more clear. Hodder assured Noll that the notion of breadth was
   firmly imbedded in the faculty's vision for the program, even if it
   did not come through in the description. Gelber noted that C-US had
   explored similar concerns, and was satisfied that the student advising
   process would strongly guide students to make appropriate choices
   within the major.

   <p>The following motion, moved and seconded by the Committee on
   Undergraduate Studies, was approved by voice vote without dissent:

   <p>The Senate approves the initiation of the Interdisciplinary Program in
   Archaeology and authorizes the Executive Committee of the
   Interdisciplinary Program in Archaeology to nominate candidates for
   the B. A. degree for five years effective September 1, 2001 through
   August 31, 2006.

   <p>1999/2000 Annual Report from the Committee on Academic Computing and
   Information Systems (SenD#5123)

   <p>Senate Chair Brad Osgood, having served as the 1999/2000 chair of
   C-ACIS, handed the gavel to the Academic Secretary and stepped forward
   to present the committee's report. Osgood identified and thanked
   committee members and staff, and indicated that C-ACIS over the years
   "cycles through" discussion of basic computing issues such as
   infrastructure, the network and its support, administrative computing,
   general computing support, and network security. He explained that for
   C-ACIS and the other six Academic Council committees, important things
   often happen not as formal committee actions, but rather as a result
   of the senior administrative officers who serve ex-officio being
   responsive to faculty viewpoints and going away and "getting things
   done." Osgood summarized the main themes of the prior year,
   emphasizing departmental computing support and "computing as a public
   good." He provided some striking statistics concerning the extent of
   computing equipment requiring some level of support at Stanford:
   roughly 60,000 desktop machines (60% PC, 30% Mac, 10% Unix); 516
   subnets with 50,000 nodes; and more than 100% growth in web pages and
   1,000% growth in disk space between 1994 and 1998. The committee had
   considered two alternative models for "computing as a public good," he
   said -- the library model (centrally funded, shared resources) versus
   the utilities model (charges for services based on usage). Osgood
   noted that this was a large topic, complicated by the significant
   variations among departments, and that discussions were ongoing in
   C-ACIS this year.

   <p>Professor Paul Segall, C-ACIS Chair for 2000/2001, advised that the
   committee was dividing its agenda by quarter, focusing on teaching,
   then research, then additional issues. He mentioned that as part of
   the Provost's needs assessment process, a subcommittee was looking at
   long-term infrastructure needs for academic computing, and hoped that
   as many faculty members as possible would respond to a survey to be
   distributed in February. Segall said that in addition to the ten-year
   horizon of the needs assessment process, C-ACIS hoped to prioritize
   some more immediate needs, and welcomed faculty input.

   <p>Professor Papanicolaou (Mathematics) expressed concern about increases
   in licensing costs for the MatLab software that were affecting a large
   number of faculty members in sciences and engineering. He urged C-ACIS
   to take a leadership role in solving the problem. Segall mentioned
   that an ITSS staff member, Pat Box, was in charge of software
   licensing and was attempting to negotiate with the company. Professor
   Noll (Economics) said he sees C-ACIS as having a very small net and
   chasing after a big elephant, and he questioned whether they could
   ever be particularly effective. Osgood stressed the role of C-ACIS in
   oversight and as a faculty sounding board, and others mentioned
   specific policies and actions in the past few years that had resulted
   from the committee's work. Professor Tatum (Civil and Environmental
   Engineering) expressed the view of several faculty members that
   information infrastructure has become "as important as clean air and
   clean water" and urged C-ACIS to advocate for current investments to
   ensure long-term infrastructure adequacy. It was agreed, at the
   suggestion of Professor Roth (Mechanical Engineering), that the annual
   report should be corrected to spell out all acronyms. The Academic
   Secretary accepted the 1999/2000 Annual Report of the Committee on
   Academic Computing and Information Systems on behalf of the Senate,
   and thanked the committee for its work.

   <h>Report on Staff Retention and Recruitment (SenD#5158)

   <p>Chair Osgood introduced John Cammidge, Executive Director of Human
   Resources, to report on staff retention and recruitment issues, a
   topic of real interest to many faculty members. Cammidge, at Stanford
   for eight months, advised that he wanted to present and explain a good
   deal of data, provided to Senate members in advance, and to invite all
   members of the faculty to take an increased involvement in the
   well-being of staff.

   <p>Summarizing data concerning staff turnover at Stanford, Cammidge
   advised that Stanford's "separation rate" (primarily voluntary
   departures, but also including layoff, dismissal, retirement and
   death) is now 25.5% per year, up from 10.6% in 1996. The Stanford rate
   mirrors that in Silicon Valley, he said, but the national average is
   only 12-14%. Concerning total compensation competitiveness, according
   to Cammidge, Stanford benefits are very competitive, base compensation
   is generally competitive at the middle of the Bay Area marketplace,
   and incentive compensation is less competitive. He advised that the
   highest separation rates are occurring in the academic areas, and said
   that a consultant had quantified the cost of turnover at up to $68
   million annually. The causes of Stanford turnover, he said, include
   the Silicon Valley labor market, income pressures (cost of living,
   housing, better paid opportunities), lack of career progression, and
   issues with supervision and recognition.

  <p>Continuing to summarize key information, Cammidge pointed out that
   even though the number of staff vacancies had doubled since 1996,
   Stanford had continued to operate with a decentralized recruitment
   process. He also noted that existing supportive programs are not
   always used, for example incentive pay, flexible scheduling, access to
   recreation, quality of work life, and transportation opportunities.
   Support is not consistent across the university for performance
   management and career development, he said. He also emphasized that
   Stanford turnover is influenced by bureaucratic, inefficient work
   processes, poorly designed or boring jobs, and job complexity without
   adequate training. The bottom line, according to Cammidge -- "Our
   Silicon Valley environment is a challenge. Nevertheless, we can do
   more to retain and recruit the staff employees who support Stanford's
   teaching and research activities."

   <p>Cammidge presented pie charts showing a total of 13,600 Stanford
   employees, including hourly and temporary workers (but excluding the
   Hospitals). Of that number, 6,200 are in ongoing staff positions
   (excluding SLAC, for which he did not have data but for which he said
   the recruitment and retention problems were very similar). He showed
   separation rates for Stanford's 15 schools and administrative units,
   speculating that the highest separation rates were in the academic
   areas "not because of the faculty," but because the percentage of
   lower level, primarily administrative staff positions is higher there.
   Cammidge said that Stanford's internal movement rate of only 7% should
   be much higher -- people advancing and building careers at the
   university -- and that everyone would of course like to have
   significantly fewer than 25% leaving Stanford. Data also show that the
   lower the salary, the higher the turnover, he noted, reflecting cost
   of living pressures. Cammidge expressed concern that employees with
   three to five years of university service have the highest separation
   rates (34%) and attributed this in part to pay compression. Stanford
   may pay too many people close to the average without differentiating
   enough, he suggested.

   <p>Discussing staff base salary competitiveness within the Bay Area job
   market, Cammidge said that Stanford's overall position was 1.1% above
   market, and showed a slide with seven job families above market, one
   by almost 10%, and three job families below market. The specific job
   categories were not labeled due to confidentiality issues concerning
   the sources, Cammidge said. In response to questions from Education
   Dean Stipek and Professor Satz (Philosophy), he indicated that higher
   separation rates were not necessarily correlated with below market
   salary rates, and reiterated his concern that relatively uniform
   salary administration was causing Stanford to lose its best people.
   Cammidge presented data on the number of open positions -- 638 in
   August 2000, almost double the number four years earlier -- and
   indicated that "there are more job vacancies, it is taking longer to
   fill them, there are fewer candidates, and in some cases it is
   difficult to find qualified candidates." He also showed a slide
   listing the factors cited by about 350 people in a Fall 1999 survey
   asking why they joined Stanford, stayed at Stanford, and left
   Stanford.

   <p>Moving beyond the data to ask "What lies ahead?" Cammidge described a
   strategic vision of Stanford as an "employer of choice" for staff.
   "Anything that touches on the staff employee relationship ought to be
   of concern to Human Resources," he stated. Assuming that all of the
   basic personnel functions must be well executed, he identified areas
   in which Stanford might strive to differentiate itself externally --
   quality of the work environment, learning opportunities, housing
   assistance opportunities, and work/life cycle programs -- as well as
   areas of internal differentiation -- career opportunities/talent
   management/meaningful work, competitive total compensation, management
   and supervisory leadership (including faculty), and the Stanford
   community/diversity. Looking ahead 12 to 18 months, Cammidge expressed
   optimism about institutional sponsorship to support a series of
   prioritized projects involving Human Resources and user
   representatives as well as improved HR systems and support, all geared
   toward "getting the right staff, treating them well, and keeping
   them." He mentioned several items from a list of priority projects
   with sponsorship, including a review of staff housing needs and
   possible solutions (looking at the Stanford West apartments, and
   perhaps a 403(b) loan product); a new employee referral program
   patterned after very successful Silicon Valley programs; and an
   ongoing study of childcare affordability scholarships.

   <p>Cammidge discussed several additional items from a list of potential
   priority projects. He asked for faculty feedback about the feasibility
   of increasing meaningful work by reviewing work processes, job design,
   delegated authorities, and organizational structures within schools
   and departments. He also suggested that the decentralization of the
   employment function in the early 1990s should be revisited, in order
   to develop a Stanford "employment brand" and to provide central
   recruitment support for hard to fill jobs. Finally, he asked whether
   the faculty wanted to be involved in the solutions. For example, he
   wondered if the Faculty Staff Benefits Committee should be broadened
   to include all human resources issues. "The basic message for me is
   really an invitation to you to become a 'stakeholder' in the
   well-being of Stanford's 6,500 staff members," Cammidge concluded.

   <p>Professor Zoback (Geophysics) suggested that reconsideration of the
   recent reduction in the child tuition grant benefit, which he thought
   had saved the university one or two million dollars per year, might
   make a significant dent in the 25% rate and the $68 million cost of
   turnover. Cammidge agreed that education and training benefits in
   general should be evaluated, including that item as well as the new
   and underutilized program to reimburse staff members themselves for
   college tuition. Any such programs that can be designed to benefit
   employees directly, before taxes, are very valuable, he said.

   <p>Professor Noll (Economics) commented that he did not believe that
   changes in Stanford salaries and benefits over the past ten years were
   anywhere near as important as two other major changes: increased
   administrative accountability (due to the indirect cost controversy)
   and computerization. "There is infinitely greater accountability for
   everything you do, which means there's a lot more work to do. And,
   secondly, computerization has been used as a mechanism to decentralize
   the cost of undertaking that activity from the central administration
   to the academic and research units. The proportion of the work that's
   done locally has been increased with no change in classification level
   and no change in the number of staff. As a result, the amount of time
   has gone way up that department administrative staff spend proving
   they're not criminals or satisfying some distant person that they
   never can talk to because they only have voice mail. And if you just
   talk to these people, they'll tell you that's why they don't like
   their jobs." The faculty in departments also feels these things, e.g.,
   trying to get reimbursed for travel or to spend their grant money,
   Noll said, but they have no real way to judge how much of the
   increasing complexity is absolutely required, or how much might have
   been overreacting to external circumstances. H & S Dean Beasley said
   that he agreed to some extent but also felt that the faculty could
   play a significant role in reexamining the administrative structures
   in their own departments and schools. Professor Wooley (Electrical
   Engineering) agreed with Noll that staff had a particularly miserable
   job arranging for travel and reimbursement. President Hennessy
   cautioned that the faculty often do not read the rules and the
   difficult task of telling them "You can't do this," falls to the
   staff.

   <p>Professor Tatum (Civil and Environmental Engineering) commented that
   rules concerning equity with existing employees were one of the most
   difficult challenges in hiring new people. Responding to Wooley,
   Cammidge indicated that the data presented to Senate was public and
   could be shared with department staff. He said that he would be
   delighted to come to departments to discuss the issues, and Senate
   Chair Osgood encouraged him to do so. Osgood thanked Cammidge for a
   thoughtful presentation.

   <p>Obtaining a motion and a second, Osgood declared the Senate meeting
   adjourned at 5:13 p.m.

                                                  <h>Respectfully submitted,
