   <h>1215 GMT 30 June

   <p>If Tony Blair really wants to crack down on anti-social behaviour,
   perhaps he could take a leaf out of Singapore's book.

   <p>Hacks travelling to the island for the Olympics 2012 announcement have
   been warned they must not take more than one pack of cigarettes with
   them and there is a list of the few places where smoking is allowed.

   <p>Even better, they have been told chewing gum is only permitted on
   medical prescription.

   <p>And to put the cap on it all, they have been reminded that spitting in
   public is also an offence.

   <p>Now you're talking.

   <h>1030 GMT 29 June

   <p>Chancellor Gordon Brown made an interesting speech to the Fabian
   Society at its summer party on the Commons terrace.

   <h>Signs from above for Brown

   <p>After all the usual stuff about Africa, the election, etcetera,
   etcetera, he suddenly slipped into campaigning mode and started
   talking about the (for which most read "his") "historic fourth term".

   <p>The Thames boiled, the heavens opened, rent asunder by slashes of
   lightning and thunderous claps of, er, thunder.

   <p>What could it all mean?

   <h>1230 GMT 28 June

   <p>One of the great symbolic modernisations of the Tories under Michael
   Howard was to move the party out of its old Smith Square headquarters
   into a glistening new office over Starbucks.

   <p>Apart from giving the party an up-to-date image, the aim was to flog
   off the Smith Square building to raise cash for party coffers.

   <p>Except no one wants to buy it. Apparently the fading and warren-like
   interior needs a thorough makeover.

   <p>So much so that one insider whispered the party may even have to move
   back in.

   <p>What sort of message would that send out?

   <h>1130 GMT 27 June

   <p>Would-be Tory leader Alan Duncan may be unmarried and have no
   children, but he has found a "family" to care for over the past few
   days.

   <p>St James' Park is close to his Westminster residence and one of the
   ducks recently delivered a fine clutch of chicks in his garden.

   <p>Three of the ducklings hardly had time to squeak before they became
   Magpie food, but three have survived and, I'm told, have become the
   apple of Mr Duncan's eye.

   <p>Now he can't wait to get home each evening to check up on his new
   charges.

   <h>1230 GMT 23 June

   <p>Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith has always had a certain way with
   words.

   <p>Remember the "quiet man" who then "turned up the volume".

   <p>Well he's at it again - this time in relation to his pet project the
   Centre for Social Justice.

   <p>The latest press release announcing some awards made by the body
   declared: "Think-tank turns do-tank".

   <h>1630 GMT 21 June

   <p>One of the great mysteries of the general election campaign was over
   exactly who it was who phoned Home Secretary Charles Clarke on his
   mobile when he was standing on stage alongside the prime minister
   during the Labour manifesto launch.

   <p>The incident brought some much-needed light relief to the proceedings
   which, you may remember, resembled TV's The Weakest Link.

   <p>Well, Education Secretary Ruth Kelly has finally confessed, during a
   lunch for political journalists, that it was her. Or, more accurately,
   it was her ageing driver, Eddie, who was ferrying her around during
   the campaign.

   <p>He was provided with a car, mobile phone and satellite navigation
   system for the campaign, but had absolutely no idea how to use the sat
   nave kit.

   <p>As he was driving the minister to the manifesto launch at London's
   Mermaid Theatre he became hopelessly lost. So Ms Kelly borrowed his
   phone to contact her friend Charles Clarke who guided them to the
   venue before the event kicked off.

   <p>Unfortunately when it was time for the driver to return to pick up his
   passenger he once again became lost.

   <p>Luckily he still had the mobile phone and knew how to use the redial
   last number button - much to Mr Clarke's embarrassment.

   <h>1530 GMT 20 June

   <p>At the start of last week's EU summit, before tempers snapped and
   personal insults started flying across the Channel, the prime minister
   was happy enough to aim a small joke in Jacques Chirac's direction.

   <p>Asked about the French President's attendance at the looming G8 summit
   in Gleneagles, Mr Blair said he was happy to announce M Chirac would
   be there.

   <p>But he only persuaded him to come by reassuring him he would not have
   to wear "le kilt", joked Mr Blair.

   <p>Er, well that's not quite how it has turned out. It now appears the
   President expects to remain in Singapore to celebrate Paris' expected
   victory in the 2012 Olympics bid - so will miss the first day of the
   summit.

   <p>Indeed, there are even those suggesting he will stay in Singapore even
   if Paris doesn't win, just to embarrass the prime minister. Unless, of
   course, London wins.

   <h>1230 GMT 16 June

   <p>Most people would be understandably flattered to discover they have
   been included in a reference work.

   <p>But Commons leader and former Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon was
   probably less than delighted when his Tory opposite number Chris
   Grayling pointed out he had made it into a dictionary.

   <p>Unfortunately it is the online cockney rhyming slang dictionary which
   declares Geoff Hoon can now be taken as slang for baboon, as in
   "you're a right Geoff Hoon you are".

   <p>I should be careful about pointing this out Mr Grayling - your name
   does, after all, rhyme with failing.

   <h>1500 GMT 15 June

   <p>Baroness Margaret Thatcher may not have quite the pulling power she
   once did - but there are clearly those who still carry the torch.

   <h>Thatcher still has her fans

   <p>One of the events during a dinner to mark the 30th anniversary of her
   election as Tory leader was an auction to raise cash for the hosts,
   Conservative Way Forward.

   <p>Top prize was a cup of tea on the House of Lords' terrace with the
   great Lady herself.

   <p>The bids just kept on coming - and ended with the lucky winner
   pledging a stunning Â£6,100.00 for the privilege.

   <p>Do I hear any bids for a skinny latte with the prime minister?

   <h>1200 GMT 11 June

   <p>It's been a pretty good week for Liberal Democrat leader Charles
   Kennedy.

   <p>Not only has all the talk about leadership challenges in the wake of
   his less-than-hoped-for election performance evaporated, but one of
   his political predictions appears to be coming true.

   <p>Firstly, and you can be forgiven for not noticing, he has been
   re-elected as party leader - if that is the right phrase in the
   absence of an actual vote or challenge.

   <p>Secondly a new opinion poll has suggested that public support for ID
   cards has started to slide dramatically from around 80% to 55%, just
   as Mr Kennedy has always claimed it would.

   <p>Now one poll may not signify anything, but it comes amid growing
   whispers that Home Secretary Charles Clarke is desperately seeking a
   way of averting a Commons defeat over the issue when it comes back
   before MPs in the next couple of weeks.

   <p>And if that happens, as with Iraq, Mr Kennedy will claim he is the
   only party leader to have consistently opposed the policy.

   <h>1200 GMT 10 June

   <p>The government is, as we all know, committed to freedom of information
   - and it expects all Whitehall departments to do their bit.

   <p>Even the once hugely-secretive Ministry of Defence is on board and has
   part of its website devoted to telling people how to use the system to
   get the information they want.

   <p>Unfortunately for one colleague it didn't quite work like that.

   <p>First he rang the MoD to ask about how to obtain information under the
   FOI rules.

   <p>The switchboard attempted to put him through to a number which did not
   work.

   <p>So he was given another number to dial himself. That connected to one
   of those infernal disembodied voices which directed him to yet another
   number.

   <p>When that was dialled he was greeted with the message that the number
   could not be recognised. At which point he gave up.

   <p>Only a temporary tickle on the freedom front I'm sure.

   <h>1300 GMT 9 June

   <p>A bit late in the day perhaps, but I have only just heard of a great
   wheeze deployed by ex-Tory election boss, Lynton Crosby, to keep
   morale high among the party's staff during the election campaign.

   <p>He handed out daily prizes for all sorts of things other than simply
   good performance. For example, on one occasion the award was for the
   best mobile phone tone.

   <p>The budget for this scheme was quite low, however, so the prizes were
   modest, but imaginative, and were sometimes awarded for only a day.

   <p>The bottle of beer was, understandably, non returnable, but the
   booklet of the "60 most appalling lefties" had to be returned once
   read.

   <p>More alarmingly, so did the Union Jack G string. Whether it was put to
   use before being returned for re-awarding is a question too far.

   <p>At the end of the campaign it was retrieved from the last winner,
   framed and handed back to Mr Crosby with a note of thanks signed by
   party staff.

   <h>1300 GMT 8 June

   <p>One of the more pleasant events of the parliamentary calendar is the
   journalists' reception for new MPs, which took place last night.

   <p>This tradition is aimed partly at showing the new intake what a
   thoroughly friendly, trustworthy and sober bunch we all are.

   <p>But it is hard not to get the impression that some of the MPs have
   come along simply to put a face to the names of those they expect to
   be their future tormentors - or at whose hands they believe they may
   have already suffered.

   <p>Still, it was a thoroughly enjoyable and, hopefully useful event.

   <p>As the splendid chairman of the press gallery, John Hipwood declared
   at the end of his welcoming speech to the MPs: "Remember, we are here
   to help."

   <h>1445 GMT 7 June

   <p>Staff and MPs returning from the short Whitsun recess have been
   greeted by signs telling them where they are no longer allowed to
   smoke.

   <p>No great surprise there as there has been a continuing programme of
   gradually turning the Palace of Westminster into a smoke free zone.

   <p>But what surprised and even angered some was the rule banning people
   from lighting up outdoors if they were in sight of members of the
   public.

   <p>Presumably the powers that be think it would not present the right
   image to tourists visiting the mother of parliaments to see little
   knots of people hanging around the precincts shrouded in clouds of
   smoke.

   <p>The rules state quite bluntly that any member of staff found puffing
   away in front of the public will be reported to their line manager.
   Persistent offenders will face disciplinary action.

   <p>It is not clear whether these restrictions apply to MPs - they would
   never seek privileges ahead of members of staff would they?

   <p>Still I would love to witness the first occasion one of the security
   staff attempts to stop an MP lighting up in full view of the public.

   <h>1530 GMT 6 June

   <p>They will never admit it, but there are those in the government who
   are revelling in Jacques Chirac's discomfort over his country's "No"
   vote on the constitution.

   <p>Relations between Britain and France have always been on a
   rollercoaster and there have been some serious fallings out over the
   years.

   <p>And there are many in the Foreign Office and Downing Street who find
   President Chirac both arrogant and overbearing.

   <p>Could this have anything to do with Foreign Secretary Jack Straw's
   refusal to pronounce the EU constitution well and truly dead?

   <p>One very senior FCO figured whispered: "We will leave it to Mr Chirac
   to kill off the constitution. That will be exquisite."

   <p>So, diplomatic relations back to normal then.

   <h>1230 GMT 26 May

   <p>This will either delight or terrify you - but Norman Tebbit has cloned
   himself.

   <h>Could there ever be another Tebbit?

   <p>The ex Tory Chairman, once branded the "Chingford skinhead" and before
   whom lesser politicians cowered, has stepped into the row over Michael
   Howard's leadership.

   <p>Asked who he fancied as the next Tory boss, he revealed he had had
   himself cloned.

   <p>The carbon copy Tebbit is currently too young to take over the job, he
   declared, but his moment would come.

   <p>So which youngster on the Tory benches has this particular big beast's
   DNA running through him?

   <p>Probably not the current MP for Chingford - one Iain Duncan Smith.

   <h>1200 GMT 25 May

   <p>Let's start the new Parliament with a poser. Exactly what is it with
   Tony Blair and blue frogs?

     <h>Has Blair got frogs on the mind

   <p>When the prime minister announced election day all those weeks ago he
   was wearing a rather fetching red tie with blue frog motif.

   <p>Nothing particularly odd about that. Either he was doing it to win a
   bet or more likely, as any father will instantly confirm, because it
   was a present from one of his children - presumably whichever has the
   most well developed sense of humour.

   <p>But wait, what's this. The very same tie made another appearance on
   the day the prime minister was returned to Downing Street for his
   dreamt of historic third election victory.

   <p>Is this superstition, does the blue frog have magical powers, is there
   some hidden symbolism?

   <p>The most famous, or infamous, blue frog is the unsurprisingly named
   blue poison arrow frog found only in a remote area of the South
   American rain forest.

   <p>It is known as highly territorial, aggressive and, needless to say,
   poisonous to its enemies.

   <p>Or is there a more mundane explanation? Almost certainly.
