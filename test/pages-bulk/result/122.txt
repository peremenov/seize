   <h>Libya outlines oil contract plans

   <h>Under the desert, investors are hoping to strike black gold

   <p>Libya is moving ahead with plans to modernise its oil industry,
   holding talks with representatives from global companies in Tripoli on
   Sunday. 

   <p>The country, which has recently mended international ties and has
   significant untapped oil reserves, is offering exploration rights on
   15 sites.

   <p>Press reports estimate that as many as 20 international firms,
   including some from the US, took part in the meeting.

   <p>Further meetings are scheduled for London on 15 September, AFP
   reported.

   <p>Among the London attendees will be Anglo-Dutch oil giant Shell, which
   established an office in Tripoli in 2001 and signed heads of agreement
   to lay out the principles for doing business in Libya earlier this
   year.

   <h>Change of heart

   <p>On Sunday, Libya laid out the terms of its tender process.

   <p>Bids for six offshore and nine onshore blocs have to be submitted by
   10 January 2005. The winning bidders must enter production-sharing
   agreements with Libya's National Oil Corporation.

   <p>The move may mark a change in fortune for Libya as well as providing a
   new market for the oil companies involved.

   <p>Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi has managed to bring his country back
   into the international fold after years of seclusion and sanctions

   <p>The North African nation was dramatically rehabilitated late last year
   after it publicly ditched its weapons of mass destruction programme,
   and declared a stockpile of chemical weapons to UN inspectors.

   <p>UK prime minister Tony Blair visited Tripoli in April 2004. Mr Blair
   has claimed Libya's change of heart as a victory for British
   diplomacy.

   <h>Trade hopes

   <p>The US resumed relations with Libya, and began buying Libyan oil
   again, in June 2004.

   <p>For some of the firms, it is thought to be the first time they have
   officially been invited to the country since the lifting of sanctions.

   <p>The reports did not specify which firms attended the meeting.

   <p>BP said it was monitoring the situation.

   <p>Drilling rig supplier Abbot Group said it would be focusing on Libya
   as it unveiled its interim results on Monday. The UK-based company
   already operates rigs in Libya.
