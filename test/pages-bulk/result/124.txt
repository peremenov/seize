   <h>update 
   <p>The Supreme Court has handed movie studios and record labels a
   sweeping victory against file swapping, ruling that peer-to-peer
   companies such as Grokster could be held responsible for the copyright
   piracy on their networks. 

   <p>In a unanimous decision issued Monday, the nine justices said
   companies that build businesses with the active intent of encouraging
   copyright infringement should be held liable for their customers'
   illegal actions.

   <p>"We hold that one who distributes a device with the object of
   promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression
   or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, is liable for
   the resulting acts of infringement," Justice David Souter wrote in the
   majority opinion.

   <p>The decision comes as a surprisingly strong victory for copyright
   companies and stands to reshape an Internet landscape in which file
   swapping has become commonplace.

   <p>The ruling will give the recording industry and Hollywood immediate
   ammunition to file lawsuits against other file-trading companies. It
   could also be a boon for legal music services such as Apple Computer's
   iTunes, which could see their strongest competitor--freely
   downloadable songs--driven further underground.

   <p>It won't immediately shut down access to the trading networks,
   however. The court's ruling sends the case back to the lower courts,
   which will review the evidence against Grokster and co-defendant
   StreamCast in the light of Monday's decision.

   <p>Record labels and movie studios immediately hailed the decision as an
   unambiguous victory.

   <p>"The most important message from today's historic decision is that
   progress and innovation do not have to come at the expense of
   recording artists, songwriters and the people who make their living in
   the entertainment industry," Warner Music Group CEO Edgar Bronfman
   said in a statement. "This important decision will allow artists and
   the creative community to prosper side by side with the technology
   industry."

   <p>The peer-to-peer companies involved warned that the high court had
   opened the floodgates to litigation against a wide variety of
   technology companies, but said that they would continue to distribute
   their software and that they expected to be cleared of any wrongdoing.

   <p>"We are confident that it will be proven that Morpheus does not
   promote or encourage copyright infringement," said StreamCast Chief
   Executive Officer Michael Weiss. "We're staying in this for the fight.
   We're going to continue to innovate and come out with new products."

   <h>Cloud over Silicon Valley?
   <p>The justices were reviewing a pair of lower-court decisions in which
   both courts said that file-swapping companies such as Grokster were
   not liable for the copyright infringement of people using their
   software. The nation's top court heard oral arguments on the case in
   late March.

   <p>With the potential to rewrite the Supreme Court's 1984 Sony Betamax
   ruling that made VCRs--and by extension any technology with
   "substantial noninfringing use"--legal to sell, the decision has been
   closely watched across Silicon Valley.

   <p>Technology companies have feared that a new copyright-focused standard
   aimed at controlling peer-to-peer networks might result in a rise in
   lawsuits aimed at blocking new products. The Betamax ruling had
   protected generations of products, ranging from CD burners to Apple's
   iPod to personal computers.
   <h>Soaring swapping

   <p>In its majority ruling Monday, the court did not make any detailed
   changes or clarifications to that 1984 decision. However, Souter did
   write that the Betamax decision had not been meant as a shield for
   companies that actively induced or encouraged their customers to
   infringe copyrights. The peer-to-peer companies appeared to fall into
   that category, he wrote.

   <p>"There is no evidence that either company (Grokster or StreamCast)
   made an effort to filter copyrighted material from users' downloads or
   otherwise impede the sharing of copyrighted files," Souter wrote.
   "Each company showed itself to be aiming to satisfy a known source of
   demand for copyright infringement, the market comprising former
   Napster users."

   <p>Essentially that means the Betamax ruling's protections still will
   apply in most cases, lawyers said. However, the ruling does dispel the
   most expansive interpretation of that decision, under which any
   product with any legal use, no matter how minimal, was viewed as
   necessarily legal, said Thelen Reid & Priest attorney Michael Elkin.

   <p>"I don't think the Sony Betamax decision ever gave a
   get-out-of-jail-free pass to anyone," Elkin said.

   <p>Critics of the ruling said that the court provided no clear standard
   or test to define inducement, aside from noting several instances in
   which the peer-to-peer companies appeared to cross the line.

   <p>Some in the technology world said the result could lead to more
   litigation against young companies with new technologies.

   <p>"This is a very dangerous decision for technology and innovation,"
   said Ed Black, chief executive officer of the Computer and
   Communications Industry Association. "If you think of the Sony
   decision as a shield or an umbrella, we're afraid some holes have been
   punctured in that umbrella."

   <p>Added Michael Petricone, vice president of technology policy for the
   Consumer Electronics Association: "It is a real concern for the entire
   industry. We are faced with competitors in China and India who do not
   face the same litigation burden that companies will with this
   decision."

   <p>Not everyone in Silicon Valley took a bleak view of the ruling,
   however. An Intel spokeswoman said the company was still studying the
   ruling, but noted that the court seemed to have upheld the most
   important aspects of the Betamax decision.

   <h>Changed landscape for digital content?
   <p>The decision isn't likely to eliminate file swapping. Many of the most
   popular services are decentralized enough that they can exist even if
   a parent company disappears. Many peer-to-peer services also are based
   outside the United States or have been created by overseas
   programmers.

   <p>U.S. courts have shown their willingness to reach overseas companies
   in some cases, however. Already, a Los Angeles court has ruled that
   Kazaa parent Sharman Networks, based in Australia, maintains enough
   business connections in the United States to be sued in American
   courts.

   <p>If the decision--and subsequent lower court actions--pushes
   file-swapping services further underground, it can only help companies
   such as Apple that are selling music and movies online, music service
   executives said.

  <p>"I think the Supreme Court did the right
   thing, in a lucid way," said Rob Glaser, CEO of RealNetworks. "I think
   it will make a difference in the long slog to convert the industry
   over to legitimacy, by not allowing businesses to do this kind of
   nudge-nudge wink-wink marketing."

   <p>Apple, Napster and other digital music services also hailed the ruling
   as a vindication of their business models.

   <p>The decision could also be a boost for companies such as Shawn
   Fanning's Snocap or Audible Magic, which offer technology for
   filtering copyrighted files out of peer-to-peer swaps, or turning
   those swaps into transactions. Today that available filtering
   technology focuses only on music files, but tools are being developed
   to identify and block movie downloads.

   <p>"To the P2P operators, the LimeWires and the eDonkeys: We want to work
   with you," said Mitch Bainwol, chief executive officer of the
   Recording Industry Association of America. "This is time to come
   forward and start filtering. We can build a better digital age
   together."

   <p>Although the decision technically leaves the file-swapping companies'
   fate to the lower court, it could hold the seeds of a quick decision
   in favor of Hollywood and the record labels. Souter's ruling noted
   that the original trial judge granted summary judgment to Grokster,
   but said the lower court should instead immediately reconsider the
   copyright companies' request for summary judgment.

   <p>Souter was supported unanimously in his decision by all nine justices,
   a rare level of agreement on controversial cases. Justice Ruth Bader
   Ginsburg wrote one concurring decision that was joined by Justices
   Anthony Kennedy and William Rehnquist. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote a
   second concurrence, joined by Justices John Paul Stevens and Sandra
   Day O'Connor.
