   <h>OBJECTIONS RAISED OVER NEW TELCO PRODUCT

   <p>Eircom is due to make partial private circuits available from 3
   October, but an industry group has already expressed dissatisfaction
   with the process. Since partial private circuits (PPC) -- a kind of
   leased line that uses part of Eircom's network -- are designed to open
   up the leased line market to Eircom's rivals, it is thought that PPCs
   will be sold for about 50 percent of the price that leased lines go
   for. However, the pricing scheme that has been proposed by Eircom has
   been deemed confusing by ALTO, an organisation that lobbies for
   entrant telecoms in Ireland. ALTO has said that its members have not
   been able to determine exactly how the existing PPCs pricing scheme
   works, or whether the new products are any cheaper than a new leased
   line.
   
   <h>BROADBAND BRINGS KIDS ON-LINE

   <p>The introduction of broadband has resulted in more children going
   on-line in the UK than in any other European country, according to new
   research. A dramatic 58 percent surge in the number of under-18s
   on-line in the UK is being driven by rising broadband usage, according
   to a report from audience measurement and research service
   Nielsen//NetRatings. Nielsen also said that the number of children
   on-line in eight European countries has grown by 3 million in the last
   12 months. The research, which combined data from the UK, France,
   Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Spain and the Netherlands, says
   that there are now 13.1 million European kids on-line. This breaks
   down to about 4 million under-12s and 9 million 12- to 17-year-olds.
   
   <h>SKILLS CENTRAL TO ECONOMIC RECOVERY

   <p>Forfas has warned that an inadequate supply of skills across the Irish
   workforce will hamper Ireland's future economic prosperity. The fourth
   report of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) identifies
   the issues that need to be addressed in order to ensure that Ireland
   benefits fully from an assumed world economic upturn. It reviews seven
   key sectors of the Irish economy, including ICT, biotechnology and
   financial services. Sectors as diverse as biotech, engineering and
   logistics are primed for significant growth from 2005 onwards, Forfas
   said, warning that if current trends in the supply of skills by the
   education and training sector are left unchecked, there will be a
   significant shortfall in the skills needed to fuel this growth.
   
   <h>JOBS TO GO AT ORACLE IRELAND

   <p>Business software company Oracle is expected to shed over 100 jobs at
   its Irish facility over the next 10 months. According to reports, the
   jobs will be lost in the firm's shared services centre in Dublin, and
   the big software maker said it expects that most of the positions will
   go through natural attrition. However, if an insufficient number of
   workers have left by mid-2004, redundancies could be implemented. Once
   the restructuring is complete, the firm should have about 950
   employees in Dublin, or about 25 fewer than it had in January 2002,
   when it promised to hire another 200 Irish workers. In fact, the IDA
   has said that Oracle has only ever committed to employ 950 people in
   Ireland, with just 200 staff allocated for the shared services centre.
   
   <h>ROAMING AND DSL DOMINATE COMREG EVENT

   <p>Two controversial telecoms-related issues were tackled at a recent
   ComReg conference: poor broadband uptake and the high cost of mobile
   phone roaming. At the telecoms regulator's "Getting Connected" event
   in Dublin, John Dunne, CEO of the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland,
   launched an attack against the government and the country's main
   fixed-line telecoms over the poor uptake of broadband by SMEs. He said
   that small firms don't trust the telecoms firms that are offering ADSL
   and added that the government had done little to stimulate demand for
   the service. At the same event, Communications Minister Dermot Ahern
   predicted the end of roaming charges in the island of Ireland early
   next year, branding such costs as a "rip off." Ahern also said he
   would raise the issue with his Northern counterpart, Minister Ian
   Pearson.
   
   <h>MICROSOFT SHIFTS JOBS TO DUBLIN

   <p>Close to 50 Microsoft jobs from around Europe are set to be shifted to
   Ireland as the company further integrates the Navision business it
   picked up last year. The company said that over the next several
   months, 46 existing positions within Microsoft Corporation will be
   shifted to the company's EMEA operations centre, Microsoft Ireland
   Operations Limited. The re-organisation, part of a global re-alignment
   following Microsoft's purchase of Denmark-based Navision, will take
   place over the next few months. It's understood that Microsoft will
   offer workers in existing EMEA sites the posts in Ireland before
   seeking to fill the positions with new workers. Of the 24 existing
   Navision operational sites in Europe, 17 are affected by the
   re-organisation, a spokesperson said.
   
   <h>FLEXTRONICS TO SHUT TULLAMORE PLANT

   <p>Contract electronics maker Flextronics is shutting its Tullamore
   plant, with the loss of 80 jobs. The job cuts were blamed on the loss
   of contracts, as well as the relative high cost of manufacturing in
   Ireland compared to lower-cost economies in Asia and elsewhere. The
   announcement came on the same day that storage system maker Adaptec
   announced the closure of its Dublin plant, citing similar reasons (see
   below). Last month, network equipment maker 3Com announced the closure
   of its Blanchardstown plant, with the loss of over 600 jobs, in favour
   of overseas manufacturing. At its peak in Tullamore, Flextronics
   employed over 400 people, but last year around 320 permanent jobs and
   50 temporary jobs were cut at the plant. Since 2001, Flextronics has
   also slashed hundreds of jobs in Limerick and Cork.

   <h>ADAPTEC CLOSES EUROLOGIC SITE, CUTS JOBS

   <p>After being acquired just six months ago by US storage company Adaptec
   for USD30 million in cash, Eurologic is set to close its Irish
   operations as work is shifted overseas. The company said that about 40
   jobs at its facility in the Clonshaugh Industrial Estate in Dublin
   would go before the end of the year. Any remaining Dublin-based staff
   working at the former Eurologic site will be made redundant by March
   2004, when the Dublin manufacturing operation will be shut down. In
   total, 75 jobs will be lost in Ireland as a result of the moves. It is
   understood that former Eurologic workers in the company's overseas
   locations, most notably the US, will be unaffected. A spokesperson for
   Adaptec said the firm is moving Eurologic's network storage operations
   from Dublin to Singapore.

   <h>SINGLE TIP SMASHES CHILD PORN RING

   <p>Thanks to a single tip-off to a hotline a year ago, one of the biggest
   child pornography rings has been smashed. Operation Marcey kicked off
   in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt on 26 September, involving 1,500
   police officers who, over the course of a day, confiscated 745
   computers, over 35,000 CDs, 8,300 diskettes and 5,800 videos, all
   thought to contain illegal child pornography that had been traded over
   the Internet. The operation saw police forces identify 26,500 suspects
   in 166 countries around the world. Irishman Cormac Callanan, secretary
   general of INHOPE, a confederation of child pornography hotlines, said
   that a tip-off to German police last year from Spanish hotline
   Protegeles began the investigation that ballooned into what may be the
   largest ever child porn raid by police.

   <h>NTL TO RAISE USD1 BILLION TO PAY DEBT

   <p>UK cable company NTL has said that it will raise over USD1 billion
   through a rights issue in order to cut debt. The company, which
   operates in the UK and Ireland and only came out of bankruptcy earlier
   this year, filed papers with the SEC which confirmed that it was
   seeking the cash. The company said that the USD1.05 billion raised
   through the scheme would be used to repay a loan it agreed to under
   the terms of its bankruptcy proceedings. Some of the money will also
   be paid to its USD650 million working capital facility, and the
   remainder will go toward subsidiaries and general corporate purposes.
   The filings also revealed that former NTL CEO Barclay Knapp was paid
   USD2.1 million in severance fees after resigning in August. Knapp is
   also understood to be collecting USD6,000 a day in consulting fees.
