   US military commanders are planning to pull back their troops from
   Iraq's towns and cities and redeploy them in four giant bases in a
   strategy they say is a prelude to eventual withdrawal.

<h>Change the Media. Become the Media. Reclaim the Media: Come to the
Bellingham Grassroots & Independent Media Conference.

   <p>On March 24th, veteran TV talkshow host, Phil Donahue, now banished
   from MSNBC for airing the views of millions of Americans who opposed
   the Iraq invasion, told Democracy Nowâs Amy Goodman: âWe have an
   emergency in the media, and we have to fix it.â This sentiment
   resonates with the hundreds of thousands, if not millions of Americans
   and citizens around the world who are standing up to challenge the
   growing power of the giant media corporations. Everyday these
   corporations shirk more of the public interest, slash more of their
   news budgets, and fail to deliver information vital to the health of
   our communities and our democracy.
   <p>The movement to challenge these giant corporations is much more than a
   media reform movement, it is a grassroots media production movement: a
   movement of independent journalists, radio producers, filmmakers, and
   online community builders, a movement of storytellers constantly
   seeking better ways to make and distribute the stories the big
   corporations canât or wonât produce for our communities. This is a
   movement for everyone that likes a good story, that wants to tell one
   or hear one, whether theyâre a veteran media-maker or someone whose
   only just thought of picking up a camera or imagined seeing their
   story in print. This is a movement that believes the more we
   democratize the media by growing the pool of storytellers and
   distributing their stories, the better off our communities, and our
   democracy will be.
   <p>On Saturday May 21st youâre invited to the Bellingham Grassroots and
   Independent Media Conference running 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. at the Garden
   St. Family Center (1231 N. Garden) in Bellingham, WA. The conference
   website is www.whatcompjc.org/media conf.. This conference is a new
   project of the Whatcom Peace & Justice Center.
   <p>The conference is being held to celebrate the growing local and
   regional culture of media production, to build awareness of innovative
   community radio, video, and web-based media projects, and to mobilize
   support for grassroots powered media reform. We also seek to
   understand how the independent media movement can more effectively
   challenge the assumptions perpetuated in the mass media that justify
   war and social injustice.
   <p>Keynote speaker Patrick Reinsborough, of the smartMeme project, will
   kick off the conference at 9 a.m. speaking on: âWinning the Battle of
   the Story: Creating a Culture of Change.â Patrick is dynamic a
   grassroots organizer, campaigner, and media strategist who spent four
   year as the organizing director of the Rainforest Action Network where
   he mobilized thousands of people to confront corporations who destroy
   the environment and violate human rights. The smartMeme project is a
   collective of organizers, trainers and media activists, who help
   grassroots groups magnify their impact by linking traditional movement
   building skills with cutting edge media campaigning.
   <p>Keynote Speaker Bert Sacks will speak on âSanctions, War, Occupation,
   and other Failures of the Media.â Bert Sacks has traveled to Iraq nine
   times since 1996 with Voices in the Wilderness and Washington
   Physicians for Social Responsibility, and has extensive experience
   lobbying the media for greater and more accurate coverage of the
   situation in Iraq and the Middle East.
   The conference will feature numerous workshops, skills trainings, and
   panel discussions by local media makers and media activists from
   throughout the region. These include a workshop by John Sinno of Arab
   Film Distribution on the demonizing and stereotyping of Arabs in the
   media and popular culture, panel discussions on the indymedia
   movement, community radio, documentary film & video, public access TV,
   online community media projects, reports from the National Conference
   on Media Reform, and more.
   <p>Please visit the conference website at
    for a complete schedule or call
   360-510-4833 or e-mail norwesty@gmail.com for additional information.
   We hope to see you there!. Remember: you can change the media, become
   the media, and reclaim the media.

<h>Will they run the letter or won't they?

   <p>So Kelli Linville's wage-slashing bill got stuck in committee and the
   water bill sailed through the Senate, once they preserved union
   contracts under privatization deals. Cheers to Sen. Harriet Spanel who
   was one of three Senators to vote no on the amended bill.
   <p>Here's the letter:
   <p>The Bellingham Herald should have stuffed Michael Ramirezâs cartoon
   (March 17)equating gay and lesbian relationships with incest in the
   trash can where it belongs. Instead they chose to follow their policy
   of pandering to the far right and ran this disgusting piece of bigotry
   on their editorial page. The editorial page of the Herald is not a
   bathroom stall and it should not be treated as one, no matter what
   obscenities Ramirez and others who make careers out of catering to the
   baser instincts of our homegrown version of the Taliban wish to scrawl
   on the walls. If the Herald truly wishes to serve our community it
   should apologize. Providing editorial cover and ammunition for bigots
   is shameful and disgusting.
   <p>In the Heraldâs case Iâm asking for an apology and a commitment to a
   semblance of judgment going forward. In the case of State Sen.
   Brandland I ask for political courage. Sen. Brandland has the
   opportunity to stand against bigotry by voting for SB 6019, making
   discrimination against people based on sexual orientation illegal in
   Washington.
   Or Sen. Brandland can side with the haters.
   <p>Itâs time for The Herald and Sen. Brandland to demonstrate which side
   theyâre on.

<h>Tip Credit is Tip Theft! Rep. Kelli Linville wants to pass bill to legalize
restaurant lobby theft of worker's tips

   <p>Rep. Kelli Linville is also sponsoring HB 1795 the Restaurant Workers
   Wage and Benefit Protection and Enhancement Act (The version in the
   Senate is SB 5774). The title is totally misleading. At a meeting with
   local Dems Saturday she basically refused to say why she supported it.
   If passed this bill will effectively destroy a whole sector of living
   wage jobs in this state!
   <p>What the bills do:
   <p>Restaurant owners are pursuing legislation in Olympia that would cut
   tipped employees minimum wage from $7.35 per hour to a base wage of
   $3.68 per hour.
   <p>Instead of âprotectingâ or âenhancingâ workers wages and benefits this
   legislation would basically cut all tipped employees minimum wages to
   $3.68 instead of the current state minimum wage of $7.35. Restaurant
   Employers would be required to make up the difference only if tips did
   not. So if a server was receiving the minimum wage whatever a server
   made between $7.35 and $11.03 every hour would go into the employers
   pocket. Thatâs is basically a wage cut of $3.68 per hour, nearly $30
   in an 8 hr. day, and nearly $150 a week. Thatâs taking a living wage
   job and turning it into a poverty level job.
   <p>Plus, how long would an employee who didn't make an average of $3.70
   an hour in tips last before their boss fired them?
   <p>Another thing about this legislation is that it only applies to new
   hires. This is a shameless dirty trick to make restaurant employees
   relax into thinking this won't effect them.
   <p>Please call the legislative hotline at 1-800-562-6000 to tell your
   represatatives: Tip Credit? Forget It!

<h>Water Bill Amended, Public Interest Still Trampled

   <p>Having spoken with the Sierra Clubâs Olympia lobbyist Friday I
   understand that some amendments have been made in the Senate version
   SB 5285 (house version is HB 1357) which would facilitate the
   privatization of municipal water provision in Washington.
   SB 5285 did escape from committee.
   <p>Rep. Kelli Linville vowed to kill the house bill in her committee
   Saturday at a meeting in Bellingham:
   <p>According to the Cascade Sierra Clubâs website:

     <p>âProvisions that would have allowed private ownership of public
     water systems were removed. Now, the bill provides a process for
     local governments to contract with private companies to design,
     build, and operate public water systems. Other improvements include
     limits on the length of the contracts, and language that ensure
     water rights don't transfer from the local government to the
     private company.â

   <p>However I feel that the bill is still deeply flawed and should be
   scrapped altogether. The bill still halves from 60 to 30 days the
   requirement for public notice. The bill still deletes the existing
   requirement obligating service providers to demonstrate that a local
   governmentâs annual costs will be lower under its proposal than they
   would be if the local government itself financed, constructed, owned,
   operated, and maintained facilities. Instead local official will
   merely determine that privatization of services is in the âpublic
   interest.â
   <p>There is no reason to cut the time for public process in half. There
   is no reason not to require service providers to demonstrate the
   financial benefits of privatization. According to Hugh Jackson of
   Public Citizen even the Federal government requires the potential
   service providers demonstrate a 10% savings before services are
   privatized.
   <p>Apparently some local elected officials such as those in Sunnyside,
   Washington are so ready to privatize their services do not even want
   to know if privatization is a cheaper alternative. Rep. Linville says
   the City of Bellingham sent her the bill.
   <p>I think our elected officials in Olympia have an obligation to protect
   Washington residents from being gouged by private water companies and
   from having their municipalities budgetâs raided by these same
   companies no matter where they live and no matter how irresponsible
   their local elected officials wish to be.

<h>Why are Sen. Adam Kline and Rep. Kelli Linville backing Big Water?

   <p>While in Olympia for environmental lobby day Thursday I found out
   about Senate Bill 5285 and House Bill 1357. These bills would make it
   easier to privatize municipal water provision in Washington state. I
   have since found out that Sen. Adam Kline and Rep. Kelli Linville
   among other democrats are supporting these bills which are updates of
   1986 legislation. I am currently attempting to find out their reasons
   for supporting these bills.
   <p>Among other things these bills delete the existing requirement
   obligating service providers to demonstrate that a local governments
   annual costs will be lower under its proposal than they would be if
   the local government itself financed, constructed, owned, operated,
   and maintained facilities and instead requires that municipalities
   merely find privatization in the "public interest."
   <p>There is no reason not to require service providers to demonstrate the
   financial benefits of privatization. Replacing this standard with a
   finding of "public interest" could never be in the public interest.
   <p>Publically operated water systems are managed to deliver, clean, safe,
   and affordable water. Privately operated systems are managed to get as
   much money as possible from rate payers.
   <p>Water privatization will likely lead to substantially increased rates,
   and degraded water quality throughout Washington state.
   <p>According to Public Citizen, the Veolia corporation, the world's
   largest water services corporation, which is lobbying for this
   legislation, has "a global track record of corruption, broken
   promises, environmental degradation, price gouging, obsfuscation,
   misdirection and secrecy."

<h>An open letter to KPLU

   <p>To whom it may concern,
   <p>Your radio feature by Kirsten Kendrick on social security aired on
   February 11th appears to lack basis in fact. In the feature Ms.
   Kendrick interviews a local financial consultant on the subject of
   what people will need to know when they get a chance to manage their
   money under President Bush's plan to divert money from social security
   into private accounts.
   <p>Where is the evidence people will get to manage their own money under
   the Bush plan? Is Ms. Kendrick's report based solely on the President
   Bush's remarks in the State of the Union address? President Bush has
   not released a detailed plan and as of Tuesday, February 8th the White
   House said they had no plans to: see this story for details
   
   <p>Given this lack of a plan all reporting about so-called personal
   accounts is based on supposition. Without acknowledging this fact Ms.
   Kendrick's story both assumes and helps spread the misinformation that
   people will have a chance to make their own decisions over what to do
   with the money from their "personal accounts". There is no evidence
   that the so-called "personal accounts" will have any resemblance to
   what is generally considered personal ownership. Ms. Kendrick's
   feature blithely ignores this fact.
   <p>MSNBC's Martin Wolk on February 4th reported
   wrote that:

     <p>"President Bush frequently argues that one of the big advantages of
     his proposed personal retirement accounts is that unlike
     traditional Social Security they would allow participants to leave
     any accumulated wealth to their âchildren or grandchildren.â
     <p>"But that is not completely true under the proposal that has been
     advanced by White House officials, which would require many workers
     to convert some or all of their savings into annuities that would
     expire at death."
     <p>and that: "According to a senior administration official who
     briefed reporters on the still-sketchy proposal this week, many
     workers who elect to participate in the personal account program
     would be required at retirement age to purchase an annuity to
     ensure they have a minimal stream of annual income for the rest of
     their life."

   <p>Mr Wolk minces word by saying that the assumptions promoted the
   President and repeated by Ms. Kendricks are "not completely true."
   They are intentionally misleading. To be blunt they are lies promoted
   by the White House to help sell their plan. There are many ways to
   approach this story and many ways to distort it. I encourage KPLU and
   Ms. Kendricks to investigate these issue more thorougly before
   reporting. Some resources for these investigations could include:
   www.thereisnocrisis.com, www.talkingpointsmemo.com, the Campaign for
   America's Future at

   <p>Both our state's Senators and many Representatives oppose Bush's plan
   inasmuch as it is known. They would also make a good resource.
   <p>Thanks very much,

<h>war is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength, Bush wants to save
social security

     <p>Please repeat after me: war is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance
     is strength, Bush wants to save social security.
     <p>âBush: Save Social Securityâ was the post State of the Union
     headline in the Feb 4th Bellingham Herald. This headline no doubt
     produced a state of confusion in many who read it. In what sense
     does President Bush want to âsave social securityâ? Perhaps only in
     the sense of that officer in Vietnam who said: âWe had to destroy
     the village in order save it.â
     <p>So why is the major media working so hard for Mr. Bush? Itâs a good
     question, and maybe the question. Democrats have been doing a good
     job of holding their elected officials accountable, but itâs time
     to start working on the press. The battle to save social security
     has in many ways already been won in Washington, D.C. but if we do
     nothing it may be lost in newsrooms around the country. Hereâs
     another key question: When the President tells a lie is it the duty
     of the press to repeat the lie verbatim? Or is it the duty of the
     press to call the President out for lying? When we fail to answer
     this question correctly we go to war on false pretenses, gut key
     social programs, and bankrupt the nation.
     <p>In 1946 George Orwell published his famous essay âPolitics and the
     English Languageâ in which he wrote: âA man may take to drink
     because he feels himself to be a failure, and then fail all the
     more completely because he drinks. It is rather the same thing that
     is happening to the English language. It becomes ugly and
     inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness
     of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts.â
     The times being what they are we cannot afford foolish thoughts or
     a slovenly media which fails to hold the powerful accountable to
     the truth.
     <p>Diverting money from the social security trust fund into private
     accounts will not save and strengthen social security, it will only
     weaken and defund it. According to the Center for Economic and
     Policy Research nearly 2/3rds of elderly households get more than
     half their income from social security and nearly half of the
     elderly would fall below the poverty line without it. Additionally,
     more than 6 million workers receive disability benefits through the
     Social Security trust fund, as do 1.6 million children. These
     people have been effectively disappeared from the national debate.
     As Senator Patty Murray states: âWhile some are trying to enrich
     Wall Street or push an ideology or force market experiments on
     senior citizens, our priority in this discussion should be ensuring
     that we're doing right by those who rely on Social Security â from
     current workers to retirees, the disabled and widows.â To help save
     Social Security please visit www.thereisnocrisis.com

<h>Senator Murray Vows to Fight to Preserve Social Security

   <p>Senator Murray Vows to Fight to Preserve Social Security
   <h>For Immediate Release: Thursday, February 3, 2005
   <h>From the desk Senator Patty Murray:

     <p>A few short years after the 1932 stock market crash and the onset
     of the Great Depression, one of our nation's greatest leaders â
     Franklin Delano Roosevelt â set out to create a program to provide
     peace of mind and a sense of security to America's retirees. During
     his crusade to create the program, FDR said, "There is no tragedy
     in growing old, but there is tragedy in growing old without means
     of support."
     <p>The program he created is to this day the single greatest social
     insurance program in our nation's history. Social Security, as it
     would be called, has been a resounding success by keeping millions
     of people out of poverty.
     <p>Just months before the new program was enacted, FDR laid out his
     vision of how this most important program should be implemented.
     <p>He said: "We can never insure one-hundred percent of the population
     against one-hundred percent of the hazards and vicissitudes of
     life. But we have tried to frame a law which will give some measure
     of protection to the average citizen and to his family against the
     loss of a job and against poverty-ridden old age. This law, too,
     represents a cornerstone in a structure which is being built, but
     is by no means complete.... It is...a law that will take care of
     human needs and at the same time provide for the United States an
     economic structure of vastly greater soundness." Those were the
     words of FDR in August, 1935
     <p>But today, this cornerstone, this basic American value, is now
     under attack.
     <p>President Bush is currently traveling the country saying Social
     Security is in crisis and that it needs to be radically
     restructured. But I rise today to reaffirm the values and spirit
     FDR laid out 70 years ago.
     <p>Social Security has pulled seniors from poverty and put millions of
     retiring minds at ease. America's insurance program is a guaranteed
     benefit that all Americans can count on.
     <p>It's a promise that if you work hard, you'll have some security
     when you retire or if you become disabled. It's a promise that
     seniors won't have to live in poverty. And it's a promise that if
     your spouse passes on, you will continue to have the support and
     security you need.
     <p>And of course the program is about more than security -- it's about
     community. In America, we believe that it's important to take care
     of the generation that came before. It's important to guarantee
     them a quality of life. And it's important that we guarantee
     benefits after a lifetime of hard work.
     <p>But I'm very concerned that President Bush's "restructuring" will
     imperil the security of all Americans â from young workers retiring
     in decades to seniors retiring today. The problem with his plan is
     that:
     <l>* It's the end of guaranteed benefits.
     <l>* It does nothing to fix the long-term issues the system faces.
     <l>* It adds trillions of dollars to our national debt.
     <l>* It's dangerous.
     <p>We cannot, and will not, let President Bush tear apart Social
     Security.
     <p>While some are trying to enrich Wall Street or push an ideology or
     force market experiments on senior citizens, our priority in this
     discussion should be ensuring that we're doing right by those who
     rely on Social Security â from current workers to retirees, the
     disabled and widows.
     <p>Current and future retirees need someone to stand up for them, and
     if I see something that's going to hurt our workers, our families,
     and our seniors, I'm going to fight it with everything I've got.
     <p>Any discussion about Social Security must meet certain criteria if
     it means to be productive. You could call it a test â and any
     proposal we discuss must pass this test if it wants to move from
     this body.
     <p>We must:
     <l>* Preserve Social Security's guaranteed benefit
     <l>* Preserve Social Security's protections for workers when they are
     disabled
     <l>* Protect against benefit reductions for women, minorities and all
     others
     <l>* Protect our budget from ever growing deficits
     <p>Anything short of this would be an unnecessary, dangerous gamble
     unworthy of this important insurance program.
     <p>While weâre just beginning this discussion, my female colleagues
     and I have worked for years to ensure some basic principles are
     followed as we move forward. The promise of Social Security is
     especially important to women because women face unique challenges
     in retirement. We know that women make less money than men, women
     leave the workforce to raise families, women live longer, and women
     are more likely to suffer from a chronic health condition.
     <p>Even with those special challenges, Social Security keeps millions
     of older women out of poverty. Its benefit formulas are tilted to
     give a greater rate of return for lower wage workers like women and
     minorities. If the President privatizes Social Security, he would
     destroy the guaranteed benefit that low-wage earners need in their
     retirement years.
     <p>We also know that Social Security isn't just a retirement program.
     As I've said, it protects disabled workers and their families. If
     Social Security is privatized, what happens to a worker who is
     disabled and can't contribute to her account? Today, under Social
     Security, that worker is protected. But there's no guarantee under
     the Bush plan.
     <p>President Bush could undo the progressive structure that older
     women depend on. This is one reform that would have disastrous
     results, and I know we will not stand for it.
     <p>Under this Administration, many things we take for granted from
     overtime pay to community police to safe drinking water have been
     threatened. Now President Bush wants to dismantle Social Security.
     I am here today to say that some things are just too important to
     American families. Providing real security to all Americans is a
     basic value worth protecting. We will make sure that President Bush
     doesn't gamble that security and break the promise Social Security
     keeps for millions of women and their families.

<h>Senator Murray takes the plunge

   <h>U.S. SEN. PATTY MURRAY D-Wash. in today's Bellingham Herald
   <p>"IN THE FACE OF skyrocketing health-care costs, ongoing military
   operations abroad and the challenge of continuing to move our economy
   forward, the president's top legislative priority is to break the
   promise that has provided security to millions of Americans for
   decades. The president's plan to privatize Social Security would
   actually take away guaranteed benefits and put the promise of a secure
   retirement in jeopardy."
   <p>See Senator, that wasn't so hard.

<h>What's So Personal About Personal Accounts?

   <p>There's a lot of talk in the media and the blogosphere over the Social
   Security language squabbles. Last week privatization was getting swept
   under the rug. This week it's private vs. personal vs. individual
   accounts.
   <p>But what's so personal about personal accounts?
   <p>The argument over what to call them dances neatly right over this
   point. If all the people who believe the Bush people when they say
   "It's your money" get clued into the fact that it's not really going
   to be "their money" and they won't get to opt out and get "their
   money" under this plan, they'll hardly be anyone left on the
   administration's side to hold up their banner for them.
   <p>According to The Center for Economic and Policy Research's Social
   Security Review from January 18
   <p>"...the White House is not considering allowing individuals the kind
   of control over these accounts that readers would normally associate
   with personal ownership. Instead, Plan 2 from the Presidentâs Social
   Security Commission, upon which the White House is shaping its
   proposal, would only offer workers a very limited choice of index
   funds, into which the government would place their money. Also, the
   Presidentâs plan would not allow workers to draw down money from their
   accounts prior to retirement."
   <p>If this comment accurately reflects the Bush plan, the issue isn't
   whether the accounts are "private or personal", it's that they're
   neither. Could we start talking about this?

<h>Hidden in Plain Sight: Why is the Media Ignoring 8 Million Disabled Workers
and their Families?

   <p>Here's a must read from Counterpunch:

     <h>8 Million Disabled Workers
     Social Security Privatization and Disability
     <h>by Marta Russell
     <p>The Social Security privatization debate has omitted the fate in
     store for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) as a part of
     the program's family of benefits. Social Security not only provides
     Old-Age protection, it consists of often overlooked Survivors and
     Disability Insurance protections as well

<h>Take That Senator Murray!

   <h>From The Tacoma News Tribune Letters to the Editor:
   <h>Stateâs legislators must speak out against Bush plan
   <p>Both Washingtonâs senators and many of our stateâs representatives are
   telling their constituents they oppose the presidentâs plan to divert
   money from Social Security into private accountsâ¦Itâs time for them
   to go public, stand up and be counted
   <h>N. Johnson
   <h>From Talking Points Memo:
   <p>Has a cat got Sen. Patty Murray's tongue? One of her constituents
   seems to think so.
   <h>-- Josh Marshall
   <h>From the Cursor Media Patrol:
   <p>A Tacoma News Tribune letter writer took his representatives to task
   for doing "exactly what Karl Rove wants them to do" by "studiously
   ignoring" the issue of privatization, adding that "at least Armstrong
   Williams is getting paid to follow the Bush administration's script."
   <p>Not bad for one letter to the editor.

<h>The 18 Percenters

   <p>The Seattle Post-Intelligence reports:
   <p>"Only 18 percent of those polled believed Social Security was facing a
   crisis."
   <p>'18 percenter', sort of like 'dead-ender'

<h>Social Sec' Resources

   <p>Here's a good Social Security resource page someone posted at DKos:

     <p>Here are the local numbers to call and a suggestion of what to say:

     <p>BothWashington Stateâs Senators and many of our stateâs
     Representatives are telling their constituents they oppose the
     Presidentâs plan to divert money from the Social Security trust
     fund into private accounts. With the one exception of Rep. Adam
     Smith, our congressional delegation has so far refused to make
     their opposition public. If you want to save Social Security as we
     know it, contact our Senators and Representatives and tell them
     itâs not enough to just tell their constituents they oppose the
     Presidentâs plan for private accounts. Tell them itâs time to stand
     up and be counted.

     <p>Rep. Rick Larsen (202) 225-2605 (D.C.)
     E-mail: Rick.Larsen@mail.house.gov

     <p>Sen. Maria Cantwell (202) 224-3441 (D.C.)
     E-mail: Maria_Cantwell@ cantwell.senate.gov

     <p>Sen. Patty Murray (202) 224-2621 (D.C.)
     
   <p>I would also suggest people call Air America Radio (AM 1090 in
   Seattle) to tell people to contact Congress and get them to actually
   do something. I got through to the Laura Flanders show in about ten
   minutes Sunday night.

<h>A Disservice, Even A Dishonesty to Constituents

   <p>Josh Marshall at Talking Points Memo, posted this after I e-mailed
   him. (Here's the link-you have to scroll down a bit):

     <p>We're hearing from many readers across the country who are calling
     or writing to their representatives and senators only to hear that
     they can't make any public comment because the president hasn't
     released his plan yet.

     <p>"The staffer I talked to this afternoon in Senator [blank]'s
     office," says one reader, "told me that they had been waiting to go
     public because they didn't have a concrete proposal to respond to."

     <p>Please.

     <p>This sort of mumbojumbo might have some logic from a Republican up
     for reelection next year who's trying to be as cautious as
     possible. But why would any Democrat -- like the recently-reelected
     senator from the Northwest whose office the reader contacted -- be
     saying something so foolish? The White House has its own reasons
     for pretending they haven't decided on a specific plan yet. But why
     do the president's opponents have to pretend that that's really
     true?

     <p>Everybody in the country who's paying any attention to this debate
     knows the essence of the president's plan -- he wants to replace a
     portion of Social Security with private investment accounts. How he
     fudges the numbers on the cost side or deals with benefit cuts
     remains a bit muddled. But the fundamental point is as clear as
     day.

     <p>So why should any senator or representative be waiting one minute
     to make their position clear, unless he or she is seriously
     entertaining the idea of voting for the president's plan?

     <p>How many details of an upper-income-earner tax hike do most
     Republicans need to see before they're willing to say they oppose
     it?

     <p>Yeah, that's my sense too.

     <p>To be cagey like this is not only a disservice, even a dishonesty,
     to constituents, it's also the height of foolishness for any
     lawmaker who really cares about preserving Social Security and not
     letting the president end the program.
     <h>-- Josh Marshall
     <p>Here's the e-mail I sent him:

   <p>Hi,
   <p>Thanks for your great coverage of Social Security, to me (someone who
   cares alot about what's been going on in Iraq) this is a way, way
   bigger deal. In particular thanks for highlighting Adam Smith's views,
   he can be a real pain on a lot of issues and our congressman, Rick
   Larsen, in the 2nd district tends to follow him around by the nose.
   (Larsen's opposed-all his staffer's been told to say-as of this
   afternoon).
   <p>I think now that things are starting to fall out we really need to
   push people to get their Senators and Representatives who are with us
   on this one to go public. Because if they don't there's nothing to
   counter the rights big media buys. The staffer I talked to this
   afternoon in Senator Murray's office told me that they had been
   waiting to go public because they didn't have a concrete proposal to
   respond to! WTF! Is Karl Rove supplying their office with all the
   Kool-Aid they can drink? Murray should be hitting this hard, she just
   got re-elected by a wide margin, she could be providing Sen. Cantwell
   with some cover on this.
   <p>Maria Cantwell, also still opposed to private accounts, may be excused
   a bit by the fact that she is up for reelection soon, but she still is
   working to make the Enron scandal one of her signature issues. If your
   going to shoulder the banner of economic populism this is hardly the
   time or place to leave the field.
   I've attached an article/press releases from our local paper about
   congressional prioriaties that doesn't mention SS once.
   <p>Thanks,
   <p>Nate Johnson

<h>Social Security: the Mother of All Battles

     <p>I'm not kidding this is the big one. The election was one thing, if
     Democrats lose out to Bush on private accounts its time to pack up
     the tents.
     Here's the letter I sent about half a dozen of the big paper's in
     this state on Social Security.

     <p>Dear Editor,
     <p>Both Washington Stateâs Senators and many of our stateâs
     Representatives are telling their constituents they oppose the
     Presidentâs plan to divert money from the Social Security trust
     fund into private accounts. But with the notable exception of Rep.
     Adam Smith who has told the New Republic he categorically opposes
     private accounts, the rest of our congressional delegation is
     studiously ignoring the issue in public.

     <p>I called Sen. Murrayâs office Friday and was told that while they
     oppose private accounts theyâve been waiting to see the substance
     of the Presidentâs proposal. Their waiting for what?! Thatâs
     exactly what Karl Rove wants them to do. At least Armstrong
     Williams is getting paid to follow the Bush administrationâs
     script.

     <p>Instead of sitting on their hands our Senators and Representatives
     need to be doing everything in their power to protect Social
     Security from the imminent Republican attempt to privatize and
     ultimately destroy the most successful anti-poverty program in our
     nationâs history. Itâs not as if this planned assault doesnât
     affect anyone. More than 890,000 Washington state residents are
     current Social Security beneficiaries. Senator Murray, in
     particular, who easily won re-election, has no excuse for remaining
     silent. If you want to save Social Security as we know it, please
     contact our Senators and Representatives and tell them itâs not
     enough to just tell their constituents they oppose the Presidentâs
     plan for private accounts. Tell them, itâs time to go public, to
     stand up and be counted.

     <h>N.
