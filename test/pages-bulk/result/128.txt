                                  <h>Abstract

   <p>We present recent results on bulk GaN crystallization. The best
   quality GaN crystals grown from the solution at high N[2] pressure
   without an intentional seeding are single crystalline platelets of
   stable morphology reaching dimensions up to 10 mm. The fastest growth
   direction for such crystals is [1 0 (-1) 0], perpendicular to the GaN
   c-axis. The maximum stable growth rate perpendicular to crystal c-axis
   is determined from the experiment and used for an estimate of the
   effective supersaturation for the {10 (-1) 0} face assuming two
   dimensional layer growth. The heat of GaN disssolution, determined
   from experimental solubility data, is used for the estimation of the
   edge energy of 2-D nuclei on the growing {10 (-1) 0} face. Bulk
   crystal growth seeded by a single hexagonal needle with well developed
   {10 (-1) 0} faces is also reported. The crystallization mechanisms and
   morphological stability in seeded growth of GaN are discussed on the
   basis of experimental results. The physical properties of the GaN
   crystals and homoepitaxial layers grown on them are briefly reviewed.

<h>1. Introduction

   <p>GaN is a strongly bonded compound well suited for applications such as
   high power, high temperature electronics. The bonding energy of GaN is
   8.9 eV/atom whereas for GaAs it is only 6.5 eV/atom. Consequently,
   the free energy G(T) of the crystal is very low in relation to the
   reference state of free N and Ga atoms. On the other hand, the N[2]
   molecule is also strongly bonded (4.9eV/atom). Therefore, the free
   energy of the constituent Ga and N[2] becomes quite close and
   surpasses that of GaN as the temperature is raised. Figure 1 shows the
   free energy of GaN (1 mole) versus its constituents (Ga + 1/2N[2]) as
   a function of temperature.

   <p>The G(T) of the constituents decreases faster than that of the GaN
   crystal and at higher temperatures GaN become thermodynamically
   unstable. The crossing of G(T) curves determines the equilibrium
   temperature where GaN coexists with its constituents at a given N[2
   ]pressure. The application of pressure allows us to increase the free
   energy of the constituents much more than that of the crystal shifting
   the equilibrium point to higher temperature and extending the
   stability range of GaN. The equilibrium p[N2] - T conditions for GaN
   determined experimentally by Karpinski et al. are shown in
   Figure 2.

   <p>Most of crystallization processes discussed in this paper have been
   carried-out in large volume gas pressure reactors at an N[2]
   overpressure of up to 15 kbar, which corresponds to a GaN stability
   limit at 1850K. The maximum temperature of 1850 K is quite far from
   the melting temperature of GaN. According to the theoretical
   estimation of Van Vechten the melting point of GaN is ~3000K. The
   N[2] equilibrium pressure at the melting point is therefore much
   higher than we can obtain in our experimental system. The extension of
   the GaN stability range to 1850 K allows the growth of GaN crystals
   from a liquid Ga solution. In Figure 3 we show the N solubility data
   resulting from the annealing of Ga at the three phase equilibrium
   conditions of Figure 2.

   <p>Since the N concentrations are not high, the growth experiments have
   to be long to obtain high quality bulk GaN crystals with dimensions
   appropriate for measurements and applications. Therefore, stability
   over a long time (>100h) is an additional requirement for the growth
   system. The solid line in Figure 3 is the liquidus line for Ga-GaN
   system calculated using an ideal solution approximation and Van
   Vechten's melting temperature of 2790K. For an ideal solution, the
   solubility can be expressed as:

   where H[sol] is the heat of dissolution. For GaN, H[sol ]= 44.7
   kcal/mole = 0.49 eV/bond and expresses the bonding energy in the
   crystal in relation to its mother phase: the solution.

<h>2. Crystal Growth

  <h>2.1. Experimental

   <p>The growth system is designed for the crystallization of GaN from
   solution under high N[2] overpressure at high temperature in
   relatively large volumes. Since the material to be grown is a
   semiconductor for optoelectronic applications, the system has to
   fullfil all the requirements concerning purity and control of the
   growth conditions. Moreover, crystallization from a dilute solution
   requires lengthy processes of ~100 hours. Therefore, the high pressure
   - high temperature crystallization reactor (chamber and multizone
   furnace) has to be supplied with additional systems necessary for:
    <l>1. in situ annealing in vacuum
    <l>2. electronic stabilization and programming of pressure
    <l>3. electronic stabilization and programming of temperature
    <l>4. pressure, temperature, voltage and current sensitive alarms
    <l>5. cooling of the pressure chamber

   <p>In Figure 4 we have shown schematically such an experimental
   apparatus. Many functions mentioned above are realized by the use of
   standard commercially available devices ( e.g. vacuum pumps,
   temperature programmers, mass flow detectors...). The pressure in the
   chamber is stabilized with a precision better than 20 bar. The
   temperature is measured by a set of thermocouples arranged along the
   furnace and coupled with the standard input power control electronic
   system. This allows the stabilization of temperature better than 0.5
   deg., and the ability to program changes in the furnace temperature
   distribution during the experiment.

   <p>Supersaturation in the growth solution has been created by the
   application of temperature gradients along the axis of the crucible.
   Both horizontal and vertical arrangements of the crucibles have been
   used. The typical duration of the experiments was 100 - 150 hours for
   crystals of 6-10 mm in size.

  <h>2.2. Crystallization without intentional seeding

   <p>Gallium, when heated under high N[2] pressure, does not wet the
   crucible walls (usually graphite or BN). Rather, it is covered with a
   thin GaN layer consisting of GaN single crystals. This is the first
   step of GaN crystallization at high N[2 ]pressure. The size of the
   crystals covering the Ga depends on the sequence and rates of
   compression and heating of the system. A typical structure of the
   surface layer is shown in Figure 5.

   <p>The formation of the surface layer inhibits further synthesis of the
   nitride which allows longtime crystallization processes and the growth
   of relatively large GaN crystals. Since the solution is in a
   temperature gradient, the GaN layer at the hot end of the crucible
   dissolves in gallium and is transported, by convection and diffusion,
   to the cooler zone of the crucible where the solution become
   supersaturated and crystallization of GaN takes place. The crystals of
   the surface layer are the natural source of growth centers for further
   crystallization. Some of them start to grow faster hindering the
   growth of the neighboring ones. This selection leads to the formation
   of relatively large, well shaped GaN crystals on the internal surface
   of the surface layer.

   <p>The GaN crystals grown by this method are wurzite, mainly in the form
   of hexagonal platelets or hexagonal needles, depending on the growth
   conditions. A general tendency is that high supersaturation favors
   growth in the c-direction which produces the needle-like crystals.
   Supersaturation of the growth solution is determined mainly by the
   growth temperature, supercooling, mass transport mechanisms in Ga, and
   also the local surroundings for a particular crystal.

   <p>Crystals in the form of hexagonal platelets grow slowly, with a rate
   <0.1 mm/h into the {10 (-1) 0} directions (perpendicular to the
   c-axis). They are usually single crystals having perfect morphology
   suggesting stable layer-by layer growth. They are transparent,
   colorless, with flat faces. In some cases, three dimensional,
   hexagonal growth which occurs during the post-growth system cooling is
   observed on the crystal surfaces. Some GaN platelets grown without
   intentional seeding are shown in Figure 6.

   <p>For crystallization of large GaN crystals by this method, it is
   crucial to control the supersaturation to avoid acceleration of the
   growth near the edges and corners of the growing crystal. This can
   occur if some of them reach dimensions significantly larger than the
   others. Then the edge nucleation on the hexagonal faces of the GaN
   platelets is often observed. This is the first step to unstable growth
   on these faces. The result of such a growth is shown in Figure 7a. In
   extreme cases of very high supersaturation or when the supersaturation
   is abruptly increased (i.e. by increasing the temperature gradient),
   the growth into c-direction, nucleated at the edges of the platelet,
   become very fast and leads to the formation of well developed {10 (-1)
   0} faces. This results in a hollow needle-like crystal such as is
   shown in Figure 7b. Therefore, for growing of large GaN platelets of
   stable morphology, the supersaturation must be decreased during the
   crystallization process inorder to prevent the runaway phenomena just
   described.

   <p>Therefore for the stable growth of large GaN crystals it is necessary
   to have sufficiently low and uniform supersaturation across the
   growing crystal faces. One of the most important factors influencing
   the uniformity of N-concentration in the growth zone is the volume of
   the solution in relation to the size of the growing crystal. In Figure
   8 we show a crystal grown in a crucible with an internal diameter of
   17 mm (as opposed to 14 mm previously). The increase in the crucible
   volume resulted in a significant increase of the size of crystals
   which could be grown with stable morphology.

   <p>We summarize the general tendencies of GaN crystal growth without an
   intentional seeding following from the experimental results:
    <l>1. The growth of GaN crystals from a diluted solution in liquid
       gallium is strongly anisotropic.
    <l>2. At lower supersaturations, the fastest growth directions are the
       [1 0 (-1) 0 ] ones, perpendicular to the c-axis of the crystal.
       The growth rate in the [ 0 0 0 1 ] directions, parallel to the
       c-axis is then extremely slow. This results in thin hexagonal
       platelets.
    <l>3. With increasing supersaturation, the rate of the growth parallel
       to the c-axis abruptly increases, resulting in needle like
       crystals with well developed {10 (-1) 0} faces.

   <p>We have estimated the supersaturation at which high quality GaN
   platelet grow at a rate of 0.1 mm/h. in the [1 0 (-1) 0] direction
   (see Figure 9). For the estimation, we assumed two dimensional
   layer-by-layer growth on the {10 (-1) 0} face of the platelet with a
   thickness of 0.1 mm and length of the leading edge of 1 mm. We also
   assumed that the creation of a 2-D critical nucleus on the crystal
   face results in the growth of a new layer. That is, the lateral growth
   rate is fast enough to complete the plane before appearance of the
   next nucleus of the critical size. A heat of GaN dissolution in liquid
   Ga of 0.49eV/bond (see Introduction) was used as a measure of bond
   energy in the crystal in relation to the liquid phase.

   <p>For a crystal growing at 1800K, we have obtained a supersaturation of
   the order of 50%. For the growth of GaN on a seed crystal with well
   developed {10 (-1) 0} faces, the supersaturation necessary for stable
   two dimensional growth can be significantly lower due to large surface
   area of the fast growing planes. The details of this estimation will
   be published elsewhere [5].

  <h>2.3. Seeding

   <p>Knowing that GaN in our experimental conditions prefers to grow in a
   stable way in directions perpendicular to the c-axis, we decided to
   use a needle like crystal to seed the growth on the {10 (-1) 0} faces.
   In Figure 10, we show the seed crystal which was introduced into the
   cooler zone of the vertical crucible. It had well developed {10 (-1)
   0} prismatic faces and also {10 (-1) 1} pyramidal ones. A hexagonal
   surface did not appear due to the fast growth of the needle in
   c-direction.

   <p>Prior to the growth, it was necessary to heat the system up to 1200^oC
   at low N[2] pressure to achieve wetting of the seed with liquid Ga. If
   the sysyem were be heated at high pressure, the polycrystalline
   surface layer would cover the Ga surface adjacent to the seed, and
   eliminate its usefulness for further crystallization.

   <p>The growth on the seed was performed under conditions where high
   quality platelets were obtained in previously described processes
   without intentional seeding. The resulting crystal, after 50 hours of
   growth, is shown in Figure 11.

   <p>The fast growth directions were the [1 0  (-1)  0], as expected, and
   also the [1 0  (-1)  1] one perpendicular to the pyramidal face. Since
   the growth rate in the c-direction was very small, a hexagonal face
   developed in the resulting crystal.

   <p>As we know from previous considerations, at low supersaturations, the
   growth rate in c-direction is almost zero whereas at higher
   supersaturations we fall into the "difficult" region of the abrupt
   increase of the nucleation rate. Therefore, the growth on the
   hexagonal face is difficult to control and probably is very sensitive
   to fluctuations of temperature, convectional flows and uniformity of
   the nitrogen concentration field in the crystal surrounding. This can
   easily lead to three dimensional nucleation or to edge instabilities
   of the growth.

<h>3. Physical Properties of GaN crystals

   <p>The quality of the GaN crystals was estimated by X-ray rocking curves^. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the X-ray rocking curves
   ((0004) CuK reflection) depends on the size of the crystal. The value
   is 20-30 arcsec for 1mm crystals and 30-40 arcsec for 1-3 mm ones. For
   larger platelets the rocking curves split into a few 30-40 arcsec
   peaks showing the presence of low angle (1-3 arcmin) boundaries
   separating grains of 0.5-2 mm in size. Misorientation between grains
   increases monotonically from end to end of the crystal. This
   indicates a "bending" of the crystal during growth, followed by strain
   relaxation leading to the formation of the low angle boundaries.
   Indeed, the lattice constantsmeasured for the two basal planes of the
   crystals differ by 0.001 », suggesting different growth mechanisms and
   defect structures for the two polar directions of the GaN platelet. It
   was shown by Liliental-Weber et al. by TEM examination and
   confirmed by AFM studies, that one of the polar surfaces of the
   GaN crystals (especially for the smaller ones) is often atomically
   flat (2-3 monolayer steps present) and the crystal below is
   practically free of extended defects. However a high concentration of
   point defects, mainly N-vacancies and Ga-antisites, were deduced from
   Convergent Beam Electron Diffraction patterns. On the opposite
   side, regular pyramids of 100 - 200 » in size terminate the surface. Below are many extended defects such as stacking faults,
   dislocation loops and Ga micro-precipitates. Such pecularities result
   from the different growth modes of the two polar directions of the
   crystal in the Ga-rich conditions of the process.

   <p>For larger (>3 mm) GaN plateletes, the presence of three dimensional
   hexagonal features on the surfaces is typical. This results from the
   system cooling after the growth in the temperature gradient.

   <p>The GaN crystals are highly conductive, showing metallic behavior in
   the whole temperature range of 4.2-300K. Free electron concentration
   of 10^19 - 10^20 cm^-3 with mobilities of 30-90 cm^2/Vs are
   present regardless of temperature. No clear dependence of the
   electrical properties on the growth conditions has been observed. Both
   ab initio calculations of electronic structure of GaN native defects
  and experiments confirm that the source of free
   electrons in this GaN is N-vacancies.

   <p>The optical absorption spectra of pressure-grown GaN crystals and
   epitaxial GaN layers with a free electron concentration of 6x10^17
   cm^-3 have been measured by Teisseyre et al.^ . A shift to high
   energy of the optical absorption edge for the bulk sample is observed
   and assigned to the Burstein-Moss effect. Due to this shift, the
   bulk GaN substrate crystals are transparent to near edge luminescence
   of GaN.

   <p>The dominant luminescence features of GaN bulk crystals are near band
   edge emission at ~3.5 eV and a broad yellow luminescence band centered
   around 2.3 eV.

<h>4. GaN homoepitaxy

   <p>The first results of homoepitaxial growth of GaN MOCVD layers have
   been recently reported. Pressure grown GaN crystals were used as
   substrates. The layers were grown in a horizontal atmospheric pressure
   Epigress system adapted to the growth of nitrides. TMG and NH[3] were
   used as sources of Ga and N, and H[2] was the carrier gas. The
   substrates did not require any mechanical or chemical surface
   treatment before the growth. Also the deposition of a low temperature
   buffer layer was omitted. The growth temperature was 900 - 1050°C.
   P-doping was realized using the MCp[2]Mg metalorganic and subsequent
   annealing of the layer at 700°C in the presence of N[2] gas. Si was
   introduced to achieve n-doping of the layers.

   <p>Atomic Force Microscopy studies performed on homoepitaxially grown GaN
   layers indicate the presence of monatomic steps on the layer surfaces,
   often in the form of large diameter (100 m) spirals indicating two
   dimensional growth on screw dislocations.

   <p>The X-ray diffraction peaks from the homoepitaxial layer and from GaN
   substrate from are shown in Figure 12. The lattice constant
   parallel to the interface is the same for both the substrate and
   homolayer, whereas the c constant of the epilayer is smaller by about
   0.02%. The increase of the c lattice constant of the bulk GaN crystals
   is related to the presence of the same point defects responsible for
   the high concentration of free electrons.

   <p>The high quality of the homoepitaxial layers is confirmed by the
   photoluminescence measurements. The spectrum is dominated by two
   strong and narrow lines XD (3.4719 eV) and XA (3.4666 eV) related to
   the excitons bound to neutral impurity centers. The FWHM of these
   lines is about1.8 meV and 1.0 meV respectively. The higher energy XD
   line shows a double peak structure which fitted with Lorenzian curves
   can be described by energies: E[1 ]= 3.4711 eV, E[2 ]= 3.4720 eV. The
   photoluminescence and reflectivity of GaN homoepitaxial layers are
   analyzed in detail in. Also the lifetime of the bound excitons
   has been measured to be 650 and 700 ps for excitons bound to the
   neutral donor and acceptor, respectively. This is much higher than the
   corresponding values for GaN/sapphire (70 and 140 ps, respectively).

   <p>The PL spectra for p-type Mg doped GaN homoepitaxial layers have been
   reported. In addition to the XD and XA exciton lines (XA line
   much stronger than for undoped layers), a series of very narrow lines
   attributed to donor-acceptor pair related transitions have been
   observed between 3.4 - 3.5 eV. The FWHM of these lines were < 0.5 meV.
   The PL lines observed for MOCVD grown homoepitaxial layers are the
   narrowest so far reported for GaN.

   <p>Recently very high quality homoepitaxial layer have been obtained by
   MBE. The nearedge photoluminescence spectrum of this layer is
   dominated by XD and XA peaks and 3 lines corresponding to free
   excitons. The PL lines for this layer are even sharper than for best
   MOCVD samples. The halfwidth of the XA line is smaller than 0.5 meV

<h>5. Conclusions

   <p>High quality GaN crystals can be grown at nitrogen pressure up to 15
   kbar. The main obstacle to growing larger substrate sized GaN crystals
   is instability of the growth. The instability is related to the
   non-uniform distribution of nitrogen in the solution due to the small
   volume of the crucible in relation to the size of growing GaN
   crystals.

   <p>It is shown that high quality homoepitaxial layers can be obtained on
   the "as grown", single crystalline, pressure grown GaN substrates.
   Further optimization of both substrate and homoepitaxial growth
   techniques should lead to the fabrication of efficient optoelectronic
   devices. Special effort has to be paid to increasing of the size of
   high quality GaN substrates.
