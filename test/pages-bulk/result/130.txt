<h>Could Tony Blair look at the internet now, please?

   <p>Why is the British Prime Minister the only person who seems to be
   unaware of the US hawks' agenda.

   <p>It's heart-warming to hear Tony Blair's concern for the plight of the
   Iraqi people and how the only possible way to help them is to bomb
   them with everything the Americans have.

   <p>Mr Blair's sudden sympathy for the Iraqis' political aspirations comes
   as a welcome relief after all these years of US, UK-led sanctions,
   which have caused the deaths of over half a million Iraqi children,
   according to the UN.

   <p>But I'm a bit worried that Tony may be deluding himself that his
   friends in the White House share his altruistic ideals. I'm sure Tony
   has been reading all the recent stuff about PNAC - "The Project For
   The New American Century" - but has he looked at their website?
   (www.newamericancentury.org)

   <p>As everybody knows, the PNAC is a think-tank founded in 1997 by the
   people who are now closest to President Bush - Dick Cheney, Donald
   Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz, Jeb Bush and so on. It's a pretty safe bet
   that what PNAC think is what George W. Bush thinks. PNAC represents
   the thinking of the men now in power in the United States.

   <p>PNAC's stated aims are to: "to shape a new century favourable to
   American principles and interests", to achieve "a foreign policy that
   boldly and purposefully promotes American principles abroad", "to
   increase defence spending significantly", and to pursue "America's
   unique role in preserving and extending an international order
   friendly to our security, our prosperity, and our principles."

   <p>They don't split hairs at the PNAC. George W. Bush and his advisers'
   stated aim is to ensure that America and American interests dominate
   the entire world for the foreseeable future. And what's more they make
   no bones of the fact that they intend to achieve this without
   diplomacy - that's old hat. What PNAC intend to do is enforce the Pax
   Americana through military might.

   <p>Does Tony Blair know that? Has Tony Blair read the PNAC Report called
   "Rebuilding Americas Defenses 2000"? It refers to the new technologies
   of warfare and goes on: "Potential rivals such as China are anxious to
   exploit these transformational technologies broadly, while adversaries
   like Iran, Iraq and North Korea are rushing to develop ballistic
   missiles and nuclear weapons as a deterrent to American intervention
   in regions they seek to dominate."

   <p>So when George Bush and his colleagues talk about Saddam Hussein
   posing a "threat" to America - they don't mean he's going to drop
   bombs on Washington (how on earth could he without committing national
   suicide?) - what they mean is that he poses a threat to American
   military dominance in the Middle East.

   <p>Does Tony Blair know that's what they mean?

   <p>In fact, does Tony Blair know that President Bush's advisers regard
   Saddam Hussein as merely an excuse for military action in the area?
   The PNAC Report of 2000 states: "the United States has for decades
   sought to play a more permanent role in Gulf regional security. While
   the unresolved conflict with Iraq provides the immediate
   justification, the need for a substantial American force presence in
   the Gulf transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein."

   <p>So Iraq is merely "the immediate justification" and Saddam's regime is
   not so important as establishing American military might in the Gulf.

   <p>Does Tony Blair know that?

   <p>If he has read PNAC's Report he knows that he is simply aiding US
   right-wing militarism and extremist Republican plans for world
   domination. Surely in such a cause he would not be prepared to expose
   the British people to the nightmare of permanent terrorist threats and
   attacks. Surely for such a cause he would not be prepared to set fire
   to the Middle East, to destabilize the entire world for the
   foreseeable future and - most important perhaps - to risk his own
   political neck by pursuing an evil and almost universally despised
   policy.

   <p>On the other hand, if Tony Blair, has not read "Rebuilding Americas
   Defenses 2000" or gone to the PNAC website to learn exactly what
   motivates Rumsfeld, Cheney, Perle and Wolfowitz, and so on then why
   the hell hasn't he?

   <p>Go to your computer now, Mr. Blair. Look at the reality behind all
   this sanctimonious wringing of hands over the plight of the Iraqi
   people. Read what your American Republican friends are really
   intending. Please.
