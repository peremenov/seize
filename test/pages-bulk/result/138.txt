            <h>New live-fire scoring system demonstrated to allies

                   <h>By PMA-205 and NAVAIR Public Affairs.
      <p>Representatives of Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR)âs Training
       Systems Program Office, PMA205, and Naval Sea Systems Command
   (NAVSEA)âs Warfare Center Indian Head recently traveled to New Zealand
    to demonstrate the Integrated Maritime Portable Acoustic Scoring and
    Simulation (IMPASS) system to the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) and
                        Royal Australian Navy (RAN).
     <p>This new system was developed by PMA-205 to allow U.S. Navy Naval
     Surface Fire Support (NSFS) gun teams to conduct live-fire mission
     training with the Mk 45 gun system without the use of a land based
   range. IMPASS operates completely independent of all ship systems, is
       easily adaptable, and supports other range activities such as
     developmental munitions scoring and bomb drop scoring for the U.S.
                          Navy and U.S. Air Force.
       <p>Each IMPASS system consists of a series of underwater acoustic
      sensors, which are built into floating buoys. These sensors are
   dispersed in a pattern in open water where they listen for the sounds
    of the guns projectile hitting the water following each gunshot. The
   buoys are designed to determine the direction from the buoy where the
   sound originated and then they triangulate the location of the impact
      with an accuracy of approximately ten meters. Global-Positioning
     Satellites (GPS) provide precise positioning data of the buoys and
    firing platform. Once detected, the impact data is transmitted to a
    system controller unit located on the support ship for tracking and
                                  display.
     <p>The IMPASS system can be used in the open ocean and eliminates the
      transit to a fixed land range, saving steaming time and greatly
    reducing the cost of training. For NSFS, a warship deploys the buoys
    and Expeditionary Warfare Training Group (EWTG) personnel then score
    the training exercise on-board providing an immediate assessment of
                     the gunnery crewâs effectiveness.
   <p>For the system demonstration, NAVAIR and NAVSEA arranged with the RNZN
   to provide a support ship and two warships, HMNZS Te Mana and HMNZS Te
    Kaha, to conduct a naval gunfire exercise. The support ship deployed
    the five acoustic sensing buoys, and a base station was installed on
      the Te Mana. The Te Kaha operated without any IMPASS equipment.
      <p>While the U.S. Navy qualifies just one ship at a time, the RNZN
    desired to qualify multiple ships simultaneously and without the use
    of any IMPASS equipment on the firing platform. âThe RNZN preferred
   complete separation between the trainers and the gun team,â said Mark
   Berntsen, Ocean Systems Engineer, PMA-205. âA support ship was used to
    deploy the buoy field, and calls for fire came from the IMPASS team
      operating on a separate warship from the firing platform, which
    provided the training realism their Navy desired." In addition, the
   RNZN wanted to demonstrate that IMPASS could be operated exactly like
   a land range where a ship shows up on the gun line, fires and leaves.
   <p>The morning of the demonstration, the IMPASS team, aboard the Te Mana,
      called in gunfire to the Te Mana gun team, who completed several
   firing sessions. That afternoon, Te Kaha conducted its firing sessions
    into the buoy field. The Te Kaha successfully completed its gunfire
     sessions using only the Spot Net to interface with the IMPASS team
      aboard the Te Mana. "Once again, IMPASS proved a highly valuable
       training tool for NSFS operations,â said Chris Hamann, Project
    Engineer, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indian Head, Md. âConducting
      gunfire via a remote platform was a big departure from standard
      operating procedure for us, but the system's flexibility really
                       impressed the RNZN officers."
    <p>All of the five-inch rounds fired from both ships landed inside the
    buoy field and the system provided a log for each shot, suitable for
    scoring. Completing all their objectives for the demonstration, the
    RNZN was able to fully appreciate the systems value. "Really, one of
   the best parts of IMPASS is the completely independent verification we
    provide of the ship's gun system. When an operator has a problem at
   his console, we can tell immediately based on the gun team's response
     over the Spot Net,â said Lt. Cmdr. Scott Finlayson, Ocean Systems
     Program Manager, PMA-205. âAs the U.S. Navy has learned, it really
           forces the gun team to think through their processes."
      <p>NAVAIR is awaiting a decision from the Royal New Zealand Navy to
      activate a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) case for purchase of the
                                  system.
     <p>An observer from Australia was onboard the Te Mana to evaluate the
    system for the Royal Australian Navy. Currently the Royal Australian
      Navy is in the process of requesting a demonstration using their
                                 warships.
