    <h>Should I use special detergent for baby's laundry?

   <h>Jan 1999

   <p>I am expecting our first child in a month. I would like to learn
   howpeople do their laundry with baby clothes. There are
   expensive,specially-for-baby brands of detergents (Dreft, Ivory snow)
   that peoplerecommended, and that probabily means doing baby laundry
   separately andspending even more $$.. I wonder if the dye-free,
   perfume-free detergent(maybe plus one more rinse cycle) would also
   work for baby's delicateskin. How about fabric softeners and dryer
   sheets?Cherri

   <p>My son, now three years old had severe eczema. We were very careful
   toonly use detergents without fragrance or dyes. Tide and Cheer both
   haveproducts that worked well for us. For the dryer we did the same -
   weuse Bounce without fragrance. I have washed our clothes together
   andeverything held up well.
     _________________________________________________________________

   <p>We washed our clothes separately from the baby clothes for about a
   week. Wehave always used detergent with no perfumes or dyes, so that
   was never anissue. I understand that using fabric softener on cloth
   diapers and diaperwraps makes them less absorbent.Laurel

   <p>What worked well for us was washing once with a dye-free,perfume-free
   detergent, then running the clothes throughthe full wash cycle again
   with no detergent.

   <p>We had no problems with baby's skin. I think the extrarinse is
   important, as I've often noticed suds on theclothes if I open the
   washer right after the regularcycle is done. The soap isn't thoroughly
   rinsed out ofthe clothes in the regular cycle (at least with
   mywasher).Cecilia

   <p>I did what you've already suggested - dye-free, perfume-free detergent
   with an extra rinse - when my daughter was a baby and it seemed to
   work fine. Although I had purchased Ivory, I found out later that you
   can't use it on sleepwear for baby/children since it is a soap and
   will remove the flame retardants.

   <p>As for softeners/dryer sheets - I never used them because the
   fragrance just seemed to chemically to me. I didn't want that next to
   the baby.Cathy

   <p>We don't use fabric softeners for a variety of reasons. But we found
   thatour daughter's skin responded best to the dye- and perfume-free
   mainstreamdetergent (All or Arm & Hammer, etc.). Everything else,
   including all theexpensive guilt-marketed baby stuff, gave her a rash.

   <p>Laundry soap for babies: For my own and my daughter's clothes, I use
   plainold unscented Trader Joe's laundry detergent. It's cheap and
   concentratedso a box or bottle (comes in powder or liquid) lasts a
   long time. I'mallergic to almost all scents in brand-name products,
   and the smell oftalcum powder literally makes me gag and gives me a
   headache, so I avoidmost "baby" products. The clothes come out
   smelling and looking fine to me,and when time and weather permit, I
   dry them on the line outside ratherthan in the dryer, and then they
   smell super, though they might not be as soft.Nicole

   <p>I never did my baby's laundry separately, but I've always used
   Dye-Free,perfume-free detergent for my own sensitive skin. It seems to
   work justfine, and I haven't ever done a second rinse.Dawn

   <p>We have used Tide Free with for our child's clothes since she was
   born.(She is now almost 20 months old). We wash all of the family's
   clothestogether, and have not had a problem with this method. Good
   luck, GailGail

   <p>I do a separate load of baby clothes, sheets, towels, etc. every
   week,all colors and fabrics together, with Dreft and warm water, and
   it hasworked out fine. My son does not have problems with his skin, so
   Iprobably could use scent- and dye-free Tide or the like, but have not
   asyet. Such products are very harsh, however, so I would want to do
   atleast one *warm* rinse. The other detergent we have used, both
   forourselves and the kid, is an environmentally friendly liquid
   laundryproduct, Ecover, that we get at Whole Foods or the Berkeley
   Bowl. Itcomes in several sizes, including a biggish plastic bottle,
   and is finefor baby clothes. It is not a particularly "budget"
   product, however.I prefer to do the kid's wash separately, so that I
   can better controlwhat he's exposed to, and it's not a problem to
   collect one load overthe course of 4-7 days. As to dryer sheets and
   fabric softeners - Ithink those are a big waste of money and that
   you'd be better servedbuying the milder soap or detergent. Have fun.

   <p>Many babies are sensetive to the perfume and dyes in
   detergents.Believe it or not, Dreft has fragrance and even though some
   babies areok with that, our pediatric dermetologist recommended All
   Free andClear as a better option. Absoutely NO FABRIC SOFTNER OR DRYER
   SHEET.Even adults should really not use them if they have any
   sensetivities.I was allergic to them though I did not find that out
   till this year.Suddenly all my allergies disappered when I stopped
   using them.Downey makes a "downey free" but why bother?? If you want
   to talksome more, email me.Glosson

   <p>About washing baby clothes: I've been washing all of my daughter's (9
   1/2mos) clothes with regular detergent (Tide, usually) since she was
   born. Idid one load after she got home with Tide and tried the clothes
   on her,keeping an eye out for reactions, and had no problem. This has
   worked forpretty much all of the other moms that I know. I'd say give
   it a shotbefore going out and investing in all the special detergents.
   At leastthat way, if you do have to use them, you'll know it's because
   that's whatyour baby needs. Good luck!jocelyn

   <p>Regarding detergent and baby clothes.Not all babies have sensitive
   skin. I have always washed both my kidsclothes with our clothes and
   with our regular detergent, Arm and Hammerscent free, and it has never
   been a problem. We don't use any fabricsofteners though. But some of
   my friends babies skin are more sensitive,and they use special
   detergent. Hopefully you won't have to.Liz

   <p>I have had no problems washing my baby's clothes with perfume-free,
   dye-freedetergents; All, Tide, and Arm and Hammer all work, without
   even an extrarinse cycle. (I don't use much soap, since it's not as
   tough the clotheshave ground-in dirt or anything.) She's five months
   old now, and we've beendoing this since she was bornwith no sign of
   any allergic reaction. Yourbaby's skin may be more prone to
   irritation, but otherwise I see no reasonto spend the extra money on
   Dreft etc.Couldn't tell you about fabric softeners and dryer sheets,
   though, 'cause Idon't use either.Jennifer

   <p>One more point about fabric softeners that wasn't made by responders
   sofar--the allergy doctor at Kaiser who treats my toddler for excema
   pointedthat IF I choose to use a fabric softener, it should be the
   kind I put inthe washing machine, not the sheets one adds to the
   clothes in the dryer,which work by coating the clothes (with a wax, I
   think) and is definitelygoing to contact the skin, even if it is
   scent-free. The fabric softener inthe washer is less likely to be
   right on the surface of the cloth in contactwith skin--it either
   penetrates into the fibers or is rinsed out orboth--can't remember
   that part of the explanation.sally

   <p>We were both grad students when our son (almost 3) was born, and
   wedidn't have time to do separate laundry, so I decided to use theall
   free (perfume-free, dye-free (unfortunately not also expensefree!))
   soap and it worked great.

   <p>Be sure to wash all new clothes before the baby wears them too.I was
   happy that this worked since several people in my familyhave severe
   skin allergies, so I was on the look-out for anyadverse
   reaction.Heather
