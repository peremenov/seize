                          <h>THE INCOME TAX MUST GO!

                                 <h>Chapter 2
                  <h>THE ECONOMIC ILLOGIC OF TAXING "INCOME"

   <p>L et's consider briefly some of the theoretical arguments about
   taxation. Economists have produced criteria to determine whether some
   taxes are "good" or "bad." We are not prepared to believe that any
   taxes are good: taxation is exaction; exaction is extortion; extortion
   is unjust. It makes no difference whether Congress does it or whether
   the neighborhood bully does it.

   <p>The income tax destroys more wealth than it collects. It impairs
   individual liberty in the process of exacting revenue. Far from its
   image as a fair tax, based on ability to pay, it is really arbitrary
   and discriminatory. It is not our purpose here to make some argument
   for a "better" tax. The income tax must go because it is a bad tax,
   period.

<h>WHAT IS "INCOME"?

   <p>F ew of us realize that the concept of "income" is a pretty fuzzy
   notion. If we receive a paycheck each week, or a monthly salary, we
   might just assume that is our "income." Yet, the notion is much more
   complex than that. Just consider -- what is the "income" of a
   traveling salesman who has to pay his own expenses? Is it his
   paycheck? Or is it his paycheck after deducting his expenses? What
   about his meals?

   <p>What is the "income" of a mom-and-pop grocery store, where the family
   may regularly prepare dinner from meat, milk, and eggs that are not
   fresh enough to sell? Perhaps each child in school takes an apple for
   the teacher from the fruit section. Is that part of "income"?

   <p>What is the income of a coal miner, copper miner, or oil producer, who
   may sell coal, ore, or crude oil but in the process the mines or wells
   slowly become exhausted? Are they entitled to deduct from their gross
   revenue some part for this depletion, the same way that an automobile
   dealer deducts the amount he paid the factory for your new car before
   he sold it to you?

   <p>One definition that economists like to use for income is the change in
   your wealth from one point in time to another. Of course, this idea is
   just as fuzzy as the original notion, because nobody can define
   "wealth" in any clear way. Is it the market value of all your
   property? Does it include the stored-up potential value of your
   training and education? Is your native intelligence -- or the guidance
   from your parents that helped you develop good attitudes toward work
   -- a part of your "wealth"?

   <p>The problem of attempting to measure income is one of the main defects
   in an income tax. Of course, the Internal Revenue Service loves this
   particular defect, because it can make all kinds of complex and
   obscure rules to audit the traveling salesman, the mom-and-pop
   grocery, and the coal miner. Farmers have a really good thing going
   for them. Most farmers can hide the distinction between family
   consumption and business expenses without even thinking about it. The
   I.R.S. has an entire special set of rules to audit farmers, most of
   whom don't have "income" at all.

   <p>If you try to picture someone's "income" as a river that is flowing
   across his property, you can see the analogy with the weekly paycheck.
   The river might flow at a rate of a thousand gallons per hour. Your
   paycheck might arrive at the rate of $300.00 per week. The income tax,
   however, is imposed on your annual income. The process of taking
   something that flows over time and lumping it into a fixed total at
   the end of a period of time is a major defect in the income tax.
   Should the tax be the same on someone who earns $300.00 per week for
   52 weeks as for someone who only works for 13 weeks in the summer at
   $1200.00 per week and spends the winter on a Caribbean island? Their
   annual incomes are the same.

   <p>Many people believe that a person's "income" is somehow related to his
   standard of living. The argument is that "equity" requires that people
   who have a higher standard of living should pay more in taxes than
   people who have a lower standard of living. Take two people, however,
   who receive an equal amount of money on January 1st. Assume that one
   of them goes to Las Vegas and has a jolly good time eating and
   drinking, losing all his money at the tables, and enjoying live
   entertainment. Assume the second person takes the same amount of money
   and builds a school for orphans.

   <p>Aside from the fact that both started with the same amount of cash,
   and each chose to spend it voluntarily in different ways, what kind of
   argument can pretend that their standard of living is the same?
   Perhaps the benefactor of the orphans was a lonely old woman who lives
   in a one-room apartment with three cats. Perhaps the high-roller in
   Las Vegas is a blue-collar worker, dying of cancer, who took his
   entire pension benefit in a lump sum to enjoy it before he dies.

   <p>It is irrational to attempt to "measure" the amount people should pay
   in taxes according to sociological criteria. People who regularly put
   large amounts of their "income" or "wealth" into savings and
   investments help to create jobs and furnish modern tools and
   technology to workers, who then become more productive and earn higher
   wages. How does the concept of "income" or "wealth" fit the model of
   the high-roller in Las Vegas and the lonely old woman, who might in
   fact be a millionaire's widow? There is no justification for taxation
   according to "ability to pay" or "standard of living." All taxation is
   arbitrary and punitive.

<h>HEAVIEST BURDEN ON THOSE AT THE BOTTOM

   <p>A t the end of the 19th century, when the income tax was a major
   political issue because people (both old-rich and new "poor"
   immigrants) were envious of the successful businessmen, anybody could
   theoretically become a rags-to-riches Horatio Alger hero. This is no
   longer true -- because of the income tax.

   <p>If a young man today tries to work his way through college, he has to
   watch the sticky fingers of government skim off the cream of his
   paycheck before he can pay his rent, buy his books, or pay his
   tuition. If he wants to save part of his money to invest in a
   business, or perhaps start a new one, his only funds available are
   those left after taxes. People with savings to invest who don't want
   the risks of starting their own business may invest in the financial
   markets, or the financial institutions; but any interest or dividends
   earned are reduced annually by the income tax, so they can't keep
   reinvesting to accumulate capital. Ask any accountant about compound
   interest: the difference is dramatic when you see the comparison
   between a tax-free investment and an investment with yearly taxes
   deducted!

   <p>On the other hand, some of America's upper-class or aristocratic
   families, whose grandfathers built their fortunes in the days before
   there was an income tax, enjoy a standard of living that our
   hypothetical young man could achieve only with a lot of lucky breaks
   and hard work. This is no reason, of course, to impose punishments on
   the people who already have property -- we believe in the right to
   private property -- but it is a compelling reason to abolish the
   discriminatory income tax that makes it almost impossible for most
   Americans today to accumulate any! All spending and taxation by
   government reduces capital formation and lowers the living standard of
   everyone, especially the weaker members of society.

   <p>If a majority feel anger or annoyance because some people receive
   welfare benefits from government, financed by income taxes according
   to the Marxist principle, "from each according to ability, to each
   according to need," they should look at the system of incentives as
   the welfare recipients see them. If someone on welfare decides to get
   a job and his employer deducts taxes, not only will he most likely
   lose his welfare benefits, but he will be surrendering part of his
   gross pay to the government for FICA and personal income taxes. In
   many cases, when he looks at the net benefit of working -vs- welfare,
   taking both the wages received and the welfare benefits lost, the
   effective tax rate on the first few thousand dollars of earned income
   is greater than 50 percent!

   <p>When you add to this disincentive the fact that unskilled workers
   often have to take unpleasant jobs, the reason why so many people
   choose a life of unemployment is not hard to understand. This is not
   to say that such people are making a happy choice, however, as the
   high incidence of alcoholism and drug abuse among the unemployed
   indicates. The taxation of "income" is just one more barrier to the
   development of a productive and meaningful life in our modern society.

<h>THE SILLIEST IDEA OF ALL: PROGRESSIVE TAXES

   <p>T he modern income tax is supposed to be based on the taxpayer's
   "ability to pay." This is one reason why the rates are higher on
   larger incomes. The simple idea is that for a person whose "income"
   may be only a few dollars, one extra dollar is somehow more important
   than an extra dollar to a millionaire. Yet, it is impossible to
   compare the relative values of something like "one dollar" to two
   individuals in a purely abstract way. What if the poorer person is a
   Catholic monk, living in a monastery; what if the wealthier person is
   attempting to raise sufficient funds to pay for a kidney transplant
   for his child? There is no system for making value judgements about
   different increments of "income" to different people -- so it is just
   a manifestation of hate and envy in our political system to tax
   different levels of "income" at different rates.

   <p>In the 1930s, when steep, progressive tax rates were imposed for the
   first time, politicians were using the spectre of evil businessmen as
   a scapegoat for the Depression. The slogan was "Soak the Rich." Most
   voters went along with the comedy, never dreaming that by the 1970s
   everybody above the poverty level would be paying "rich people's" tax
   rates. History records many cases like this, where the frog in the pot
   of tepid water that slowly dies as the temperature rises was the same
   creature who turned on the gas in the first place. A new generation of
   American "frogs," however, can turn off the gas! The belief in "evil
   wealth" is just so much fuel for envy.

   <p>The different tax rates for different amounts of "income" are also the
   fundamental reason why the tax code is so complex that most people
   need help to prepare their tax returns. Businessmen have to pay for
   professional accountants and tax lawyers, just to comply with a law
   that confiscates their working capital if they pay some invoices in
   January instead of December. Why do some wealthy physicians and
   attorneys take long vacations in December, or ask their clients to pay
   them in January, or tell their stockbrokers to sell things that have
   gone down in value around Christmas time? How much inefficient or
   irrational economic activity is based on the absurdities of the tax
   code?

   <p>Remember the analogy of the river? With a progressive income tax, it
   makes a big difference from one year to the next how you can make that
   river appear to flow, even though in reality it may not change at all.
   When tax rates go up or down, people jump through hoops to get their
   incomes or deductions timed in the best year. If "tax indexing" is
   introduced, supposedly to correct "bracket creep" (another vicious
   consequence of different rates for different nominal incomes) the game
   of switching the timing of your income will become even more
   widespread. Accountants and lawyers -- and I.R.S. investigators --
   will have more work to do, and will enjoy a larger share of everyone
   else's productivity.

   <p>Best of all, from the standpoint of the totalitarians in the Federal
   government, is the complexity of the tax code -- due entirely to their
   power to define "income" in an arbitrary manner. Economists cannot
   even identify income rigorously; accountants cannot even measure
   "income" except by arbitrary conventions, and they can interpret it in
   different ways at different times. When both the concept and the
   definition are vague and arbitrary, the Rule of Law vanishes! How can
   you obey a law when you cannot understand it? The courts tell you that
   ignorance of the law is no excuse. Catch 22.

   <p>Many people who suffer from high taxation become hostile to others in
   the economy because there is a perception that others aren't paying
   their "fair share." How often have you heard the self-deception, "I
   wouldn't mind paying my taxes if everybody else paid their fair
   share." Nobody knows what the "fair share" of others might be, but
   because their own taxes are too high, instead of getting angry at
   Congress or the I.R.S., their political energy is diffused at some
   abstract "others" who aren't "paying their fair share." This is the
   kind of mass confusion that governments have always used to prevent
   revolutions! Make the peasants suspicious of each other! When one of
   the peasants is cut from the mob and burned at the stake, all of the
   rest of them will cheer!

   <p>Are you tired of being played for a sucker by this game of secret law?
   Are you tired of knowing that if "they" really want to "get you," no
   matter whether it is for your unpopular opinions or your race or
   religion, all "they" have to do is look up your number and call you in
   for an audit! Worst of all, we live in constant fear of "them" -- as
   if we had no rights! The Sixteenth Amendment is a contradiction to the
   rest of the Constitution, and a contradiction in our fundamental law
   will lead inexorably to its complete destruction.
