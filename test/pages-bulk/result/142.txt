<h>Adam Smith and the invisible hand

<h>by Helen Joyce

     <p>...every individual necessarily labours to render the annual
     revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed,
     neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much
     he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that
     of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and
     bydirecting that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of
     the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in
     this, as in manyother cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an
     end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse
     for the society that itwas no part of it. By pursuing his own
     interest he frequently promotes that of the society more
     effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never
     known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public
     good.

   <p>In this passage, taken from his 1776 book"An Inquiry into the Nature
   and Causes of the Wealth of Nations"Adam Smith set out the mechanism
   by which he felt economic societyoperated. Each individual strives to
   become wealthy "intendingonly his own gain" but to this end he must
   exchange what heowns or produces with others who sufficiently value
   what he hasto offer; in this way, by division of labour and a free
   market,public interest is advanced.

   <p>Smith is often regarded as the father of economics, and his
   writingshave been enormously influential. Nowadays, "invisible hand"
   explanationsare invoked to explain all sorts of phenomena, from
   scientific progressto environmental degradation. In the modern
   context, mathematiciansstudy "invisible hand" processes as part of
   Game Theory, the branch ofmathematics that deals with payoffs and
   strategies (seeGameTheory and the Cuban Missile Crisis)in Issue 13 of
   Plus.

   <p>Smith was profoundly religious, and saw the"invisible hand" as the
   mechanism by which a benevolent Godadministered a universe in which
   human happiness wasmaximised. He made it clear in his writings that
   quiteconsiderable structure was required in society before the
   invisible hand mechanism could work efficiently. For example,property
   rights must be strong, and there must be widespreadadherence to moral
   norms, such as prohibitions against theft andmisrepresentation. Theft
   was, to Smith, the worst crime of all,even though a poor man stealing
   from a rich man may increaseoverall happiness.He even went so far as
   to say that the purpose of governmentis to defend the rich from the
   poor.

   <p>Here is a description of the way Smith imagined the universe operates:

     <l>* There is a benevolent deity who administers the world in sucha way
       as to maximise human happiness.
     <l>* In order to do this he has created humans with a naturethat leads
       them to act in a certain way.
     <l>* The world as we know it is pretty much perfect, and everyone is
       about equally happy. In particular, the rich are no happier than
       the poor.
     <l>* Although this means we should all be happy with our lot in
       life,our nature (which, remember, was created by God for the
       purposeof maximising happiness) leads us to think that we would
       behappier if we were wealthier.
     <l>* This is a good thing, because it leads us to struggle to become
       wealthier, thus increasing the sum total of human happiness viathe
       mechanisms of exchange and division of labour.

   <p>It is clear why Smith says that moral norms are necessary for sucha
   system to work - in order for exchange to proceed, contracts must be
   enforceable, people must have goodaccess to information about the
   products and servicesavailable, and the rule of law must hold.

<h>The modern "Invisible Hand"

   <p>Nowadays, something much more general is meant by the
   expression"invisible hand". An invisible hand process is one in
   whichthe outcome to be explained is produced in a decentralised
   way,with no explicit agreements between theacting agents. The second
   essentialcomponent is that the process is not intentional. The agents'
   aimsare not coordinated nor identical with the actual outcome, which
   isa byproduct of those aims. The process should work evenwithout the
   agents having any knowledge of it. This is why the processis called
   invisible.

   <p>The system in which the invisible hand is most often assumedto work is
   the free market. Adam Smith assumed that consumers choose for the
   lowest price,and that entrepreneurs choose for the highest rate of
   profit.He asserted that by thus making their excess or insufficient
   demand known throughmarket prices, consumers "directed" entrepreneurs'
   investment money tothe most profitable industry. Remember that this is
   the industry producing the goods most highlyvalued by consumers, so in
   general economic well-being is increased.

   <p>One extremely positive aspect of a market-basedeconomy is that it
   forces people to think about whatother people want. Smith saw this as
   a large part ofwhat was good about the invisible hand mechanism.He
   identified two ways to obtainthe help and co-operation of other
   people, upon which we all depend constantly.The first way is to appeal
   to the benevolence and goodwill of others. To do this a person must
   often act in a servile and fawning way, which Smithfound repulsive,
   and he claimed it generally meetswith very limited success. The second
   way is toappeal instead to other people's self-interest. In one of his
   most famous quotes:

     <p>Man has almost constant occasion for the help of hisbrethren, and
     it is in vain for him to expect it from theirbenevolence only. He
     will be more likely to prevail if he caninterest their self-love in
     his favour, and show them that it is fortheir own advantage to do
     for him what he requires of them.Whoever offers to another a
     bargain of any kind, proposes to dothis. Give me what I want, and
     you shall have this which you want, isthe meaning of every such
     offer; and it is the manner that weobtain from one another the far
     greater part of those good offices whichwe stand in need of. It is
     not from the benevolence of thebutcher, the brewer, or the baker
     that we expect our dinner, but fromtheir regard to their own
     interest. We address ourselves, notto their humanity but to their
     self-love.

   <p>For Smith, to propose an exchange is to attempt to show another that
   whatyou can do, or what you have, can be of use to the other. When you
   carryout the exchange, it means the other personrecognises that what
   you can do or that what youhave is of value. This is why so much of a
   person's self-esteem is bound upin their job - a well-paid job is
   supposed to be a sign that others value yourcontribution and find it
   worth exchanging their own resources for.

<h>How wise is the Invisible Hand?

   <p>The theory of the invisible hand is certainly persuasive, and its
   simplicityis also very attractive. No doubt every reader can see that
   it describesthe way that things really work on many occasions, and,
   whether we find it palatable or not, we probably all recognise the
   truth of Smith's assertion that paying for your dinner is a more
   reliable way to get it thanappealing to the benevolence of others.

   <p>But, even assuming all the correct conditions, does the invisible hand
   theoryreally lead to the maximisation of human economic wellbeingin
   some sense, as Smith asserts?This is where mathematics, in the form of
   Game Theory, can provide us withsome insights.

<h>The Prisoner's Dilemma

   <p>The "Prisoner's Dilemma" is a very famous "paradox" in Game Theory.It
   describes two people in a simple situation, acting in an informed
   manner,both attempting to maximisetheir wellbeing, and yet making
   choices that lead to an unnecessarily poor outcome for both.

   <p>Two people, who are suspected of being accomplices in a crime, are
   held prisoner in separate, non-communicating cells.The police visit
   each prisoner, and tell both that if neither confesses, each will be
   sentenced to two years in jail.However, if exactly one prisoner
   confesses, implicating each other, the onewho confesses will get off
   scot-free as a reward, and the other, who didn't confess, will receive
   a punitive sentence of five years. If each confesses and implicates
   the other, both will be sentenced to three years.

   <p>What should a prisoner in this situation do? Suppose that the other
   prisoner doesn'tconfess. Then the best course of action is to confess,
   and go free. Even if the other prisonerdoes confess, it will be better
   to have done likewise - at least the sentence will be lower.Both
   prisoners will reason thus, so both will confess andend up serving
   sentences of three years - eventhough, if both had remained silent,
   both would have served sentences of only two years.

   <p>It may not be immediately clear what the relevance of the Prisoner's
   Dilemmais to Smith's theory of the Invisible Hand. In fact, it has a
   number ofimplications for economic behaviour.

   <h>The Prisoner's Dilemma

<h>The temptation to default

   <p>We can think of the prisoners as being asked to decidewhether to keep
   a contract they have made with each other(remain silent) or to default
   (confess and betray the other). Similar choices have to be made all
   the time in economic society.When two people freely agree to exchange
   goods or services to their mutual benefit, each mustdecide whether to
   try to cheat the other by defaulting, or handing over counterfeit
   goods,or whether to act in good faith and risk theother party
   defaulting. Obviously, both parties are better off if neither
   defaultthan if both default - after all, we suppose they willingly
   contracted with eachother - but each would like to getsomething for
   nothing, and each isafraid the other will feel the same. The result
   may well bethat the parties are unable to carry out the exchangeas
   arranged, and both lose out.

   <p>The reason we don't see this behaviour too often is because we live in
   a society where courts can enforce contracts. This reduces the fear of
   the other party defaulting, and makes it easier to hand over
   goodsahead of receiving whatever is to be exchanged for them.In
   illegal exchanges, for example,receiving stolen goods, default is more
   common, and rather difficult for criminals to guard against.

   <p>Enforcing laws of contract requires cooperation and resources from
   someone else - in democratic societies, thecourts on behalf of the
   government and the people. But courts and prisons and police cost
   money and mostof the costs fall on people who were not party to the
   contract in the first place -who are therefore paying for a service
   that doesn't directly benefit themselves.Such courts fall into the
   category of "public good" - we are all better off in a societywhere
   the rule of law is upheld - but are not created and maintained by any
   invisible hand mechanism.Courts are set up deliberately to carry out a
   public good; and, although they may not always workthe way they are
   intended to, there is nothing unintended about their use to
   enforcecontracts.

<h>Subsidy-seeking

   <p>In a democratic society, there is a strong temptationfor
   "special-interest" groups to form and lobby the government to provide
   tax-payers'money to the group in the form of subsidies. Politicians
   find the prospect of buying the loyalty of thegroup attractive, and
   the group sees the prospectof getting other people's money for
   nothing. Clearly, everyonewould be better off if no one sought
   subsidies - by definition,subsidies are only needed for unprofitable
   activities, that is,activities that other people do not value
   sufficientlyto pay their own money for. However,if other people seek
   and gain subsidies, anyone who doesn'tbother trying to do the same for
   themselveswill end up subsidising others while receiving no
   subsidiesthemselves. This fear may force large numbers of peopleto
   spend their time lobbying the government for subsidies, rather
   thansimply engaging in more profitable activities - a classic
   exampleof thePrisoner's Dilemma, and one over which no court has
   jurisdiction.

   <p>A very similar situation occurs regarding monopolies.Since pretty much
   every producer is a consumer, it is probably to everybody's benefit
   overall if no producers attempt to raise prices by monopolising their
   market; however, attempting to enforce a monopoly can be
   veryattractive to individual producers. Smith rather sardonically
   observed that

     <p>"People of the same trade seldom meet together even for merriment
     and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against
     the public or somecontrivance to raise prices."

<h>Arrow's Theorem

   <p>As explained in theEditorialof Issue 13 of Plus, Arrow's Impossibility
   Theorem says that,in a certain sense, it is impossible to produce a
   consistent group preferenceby aggregating individual preferences.It is
   normally stated in terms of votes and elections,and, in this format,
   says that is impossible to use information about individualvoters'
   preferences to decide what is "the will of the people".Every voting
   system in current use throws up anomalies, suchas "flip-flops", which
   occur when a third candidate enters the race and overturnsthe group
   preference between the other two candidates (think ofRalph Nader in
   California, splitting Al Gore's vote and handing GeorgeBush the
   election).

<h>The "will of the people"

   <p>Again, the relevance to allocation of public goods is not
   immediatelyobvious - until you recall that an essential part of the
   invisiblehand process is that producers respond to an single signal
   that is meant to be an aggregate of all signalsby consumers. Arrow's
   Theorem is often interpreted assaying that there is no consistentway
   to aggregate the preferences of individuals to give a singlepreference
   which can be regarded as the preference of society -or "the will of
   the people".

   <p>An economic version of the flip-flop could occur if a majorityof
   customers would prefer to buy Product X to Product Y,but some of that
   majority actuallylike Product Z even better (the equivalent of
   splitting the vote); the producer may end up producingProduct Y even
   though more people would have liked Product X,and presumably it would
   have been more profitable to produce it.If this happens, then the
   invisible hand cannot be said to have worked to maximise economic
   wellbeing.

   <h>In a centralised society a few individuals make decisions on how to
   spend everyone's money and direct everyone's effort.

<h>How far does the invisible hand reach?

   <p>How economic systems work and what can be done to improve themis still
   very much a live area of research for economists.Mathematicians are
   currently grappling with the implications of game theory for all sorts
   of social choice, in particular, what meaning, if any,can be attached
   to the expressions "the will of the people" and"the public good".

   <p>The results of such analyses will not be the only factorin deciding
   whether societies move towards or awayfrom laissez-faire economics
   ("laissez-faire" means"let alone" and is shorthand for leaving things
   to theinvisible hand).Political will, whether the world becomes more
   peaceful or less,and the practicality of any alternatives will also be
   factors.Alternative systems tend to requiremuch more intervention and
   more stringent rules. In the real world, such rules automatically
   introduce more and more opportunities formistakes and corruption,
   which might mean that another system,even if better in principle,
   would be worse in practice.

   <p>Perhaps the strongest reason for leaving the allocationof effort and
   reward to the invisible hand is thatwhen it misappropriatesgoods, it
   is likely to beon a small scale. More centralised methods of
   allocatinggoods are more prone to corruption and waste. Smith
   describedpeople given the spending of other people's money thus:

     <p>..being the managers of other people's moneythan of their own, it
     cannot well be expectedthat they should watch over it with the
     sameanxious vigilance with which partners in aprivate copartnery
     frequently watch over theirown. Like the stewards of a rich man,
     they... consider attention to small matters asnot for their
     master's honour and very easilygive themselves a dispensation from
     having it.

   <p>It is useful to remember the context in whichSmith developed his
   theories - that of a heavily planned and ratherdictatorial society,
   where some individuals were above the lawand others were effectively
   without any rights. In a centralised societya few individuals make
   decisions on how to spend everyone's moneyand direct everyone's
   effort. As Smith said

     <p>It is the highest impertinence and presumption, therefore,in kings
     and ministers to pretend to watch over the economy of
     privatepeople, and to restrain their expense...They are themselves
     always, andwithout exception, the greatest spendthrifts in the
     society.
