               <h>CLASSROOMOUTREACH GENERAL OVERVIEW  2006-2007:

   <p>This is our 15th year doing outreach around the State of Oregon
   andoccasionallyinto Washington and California.  We visit approximately
   300classroomseach school year, fairly evenly distributed in grade
   levels.
   <h>LOGISTICS OF OUTREACH SESSIONS: (contents in next section)
   <p>General Info:  I'm (Rick Kang) probably the person that will
   cometoyour classroom.  The program is a collaborative extension
   ofUniversityof Oregon's Professor Greg Bothun's "Electronic Universe"
   project (see http://zebu.uoregon.edu).
   <p>We may have other outreach instructors available during the
   year,particularlyin the Portland and Central Oregon areas.  We create
   specificsessionsfor each class, grade appropriate, and addressing
   specific topics youwantcovered.
   <p>The program fits into many areas of science curriculum FOR ALL
   GRADELEVELSINCLUDING EARLY ELEMENTARY.  Content tie-ins can be
   forces,motion,cycles, electricity, matter and energy, radiation/waves,
   generalphysicalscience, and some areas of geology, meteorology, and
   ecology. Withina specific Earth Science/Astronomy program, the
   Electronic Universe canservewell as an introduction to how we probe
   deep space as well as answeringstudents'questions later on and
   providing a capstone conclusional activity suchasone of our digital
   labs (see below for details).
   <p>The overall program is called the Electronic Universe because we
   useandpresent a lot of electronics and digital technology.  We
   featurethreemajor digital items: Professor Bothun's new JAVA
   (interactiveweb-based)virtual physics labs/demos, projects using a CCD
   (digital camera), andOregonResearch Institute's new Sun-Earth-Moon
   virtual reality software.
   <p>I like at least 60-90 minutes, but we can do a 30-45 minute session
   ormultiplesessions.  I don't mind doing several repeat sessions during
   aday. Minimally, I bring a laptop and LCD projector, so the room needs
   tohavea screen, be darkenable, and have a table for the projector
   andcomputer. If we are doing any of the technology pieces, then I
   bring in aportableCCD Camera and/or a small Telescope.  If we are
   doing basic SolarSystem/Sun-Earth-Moon,we may do some activities
   outdoors (scale models, and solar viewing).
   <p>For the technology/measuring the sky program, there is
   extensivehardwaresetup, about 30 minutes, and also similar take-down
   time, and severalboxesof gear to transport, so placing me in one
   location and rotatingclassesin works best.  Since we do a lot of
   "hands-on" activities,classesshould be under 30 students.  We have
   found that "assemblies"don'twork for our main inquiry-based type of
   program.   If you'dlikea show-and-tell or pictureshow type of general
   program for an assembly,thatcan be arranged, but our program is
   primarily an inquiry-basedintroductionto the science of astrophysics,
   with a lot of participatory activities.
   <p>My schedule can get booked full particularly in the Spring, so
   pleasecontactme several weeks in advance if possible.
   <p>Costwise, this year (2005)we are requesting between $10 and $100
   perschool, regardless of numberof classes done, on a sliding scale,
   generally proportionate to thenumber of classes done but with
   consideration of available schoolbudget. (Example: 1 small class would
   be $10, a small "assembly" ormorning's worth of individual classes
   might be $30, a multi-daypresentation to six classes would approach
   $100.)  This amountgoes to Friends of Pine Mountain Observatory, not
   to the instructor,and  is used to offset our overhead costs, primarily
   theproduction/distribution of the prep video, curriculum materials,
   andhardware usage.  NASA's Oregon Space Grant currently
   coversinstructor cost and travel costs for trips throughout
   westernOregon.  For extended distant trips, we may request
   someadditional funding to help cover the travel expenses.
   Visitingmultiple destinations during one trip will help share costs.
   <h>CONTENTS OF OUTREACH CLASS SESSIONS:
   Variety of programs for ALL grade levels:
   <p>The basic presentation covers how students at any grade level can
   dorealscience with the Sky by making observations and measurements.
   Forgrade4 and higher we provide an introduction to how data can be
   collecteddigitally,and how digital data can be measured and put to
   use.  We generallydon'tpresent historical narratives, collections of
   statistics, nor coverconstellationinformation or lore (we can point
   you to resources for these topics).
   <p>Prep session, prior to outreach, is very important, particularly
   toclarifyvocabulary of objects and vastness of space.  See below
   forsuggestedtopics, and about the new free prep video.
   <p>Basic Theme: Surveying the Sky:  If we examine the sky with
   oureyes,with a telescope, or with a camera, what do we see?
   <p>Can we characterize and classify objects by making observations?
   <p>Sorting out objects by apparent size and brightness.
   <p>Observing change in appearance and position over time.
   <p>Arranging our data to use the data to draw rational conclusions.
   <p>Making models to explain our observations.
   <p>What are "physical characteristics" of objects/phenomena?
   <p>Can we measure such characteristics of very distant objects?
   <p>We are concerned with the inquiry-based process of scientific
   research,notwith "factoids".  Our program stays away from "factoids"
   and doesnotdeal with topics such as constellation lore/history
   (although thesetopicsare excellent cross-curriculum content!)  Often
   we deal withquestionsthat do not have a "right answer" nor even any
   answer at this time.
   <p>We encourage students to collect and evaluate data.
   <p>Integrated with the above investigative strategies, here are some
   ofthespecific content areas that we can work with your students to
   explore:
   <p>a. Introduction to the Solar System: Sun-Earth-Moonand beyond:  We can
   address motions/views of Sun-Earth-Moon andSolarSystem, using
   kinesthetic models, a new dynamic virtual realitygraphicalmodel, scale
   models, and lots of images from various professionalsources. Why are
   planets and stars spherical?  Why do they rotate? Whydo the planets
   orbit the Sun in a plane?  Why do we see the Moonandcertain planets
   only at certain times?  This program is suitableforearly elementary,
   and can be adapted for higher grades where studentsneedinformation for
   the Common Curriculum Goals Earth-in-Space Benchmarks.
   <p>b. Introduction to Technologies to Explore Deep Space:
   How we know what we know about very distant objects/phenomena:
   We bring a small Telescope plus a portable CCD Camera that students
   canuseto explore how distant light is collected and detected, and how
   digitalimagescan be enhanced and measured.  What are the two
   basicmeasurements? What can these measurements tell us about
   characteristics of distantobjects? This material is very suitable for
   grades 4-12 and portions can beadaptedfor early elementary.
   <p>We also use a variety of high tech JAVA based interactive
   graphical"applets"developed by Professor Greg Bothun at U of O to
   illustrate variousprinciplesof physics and astrophysics such as
   production of photons, productionofthermal spectrum, and nature of
   detectors.
   <p>Greg and ORI are both developing new virtual lab activities and
   we'llshowcasethese as they become available.
   <p>c. Computer Labs: Two years ago we commenced thisactivity,six schools,
   from grades 3-12 were successful.  We preload freeFITSVIEWimage
   analysis software plus a series of images to analyze.  Thereare four
   pairs of images taken one night apart, that have one of thefourouter
   planets (Saturn-Pluto) in each pair of images.  The job ofthestudents
   is to find the planet in each pair of images and then toidentifywhich
   planet by measuring relative shift from night to night and
   alsocomparingbrightness. We do this as a follow-up to the in-class
   session describedinpart b, above.  If your school has a Windows or Mac
   lab, you canparticipate.
   <p>d. Overview of the Cassini-Hugens Mission to SaturnandTitan:  A
   powerpoint presentation covering overview of
   mission,spacecraft,flight, scientific goals, and showing current
   images sent back fromSaturnand its Moons.  This program will work for
   largergroups/assemblies. We do some scale model activities but
   primarily focus on theinformationand pictures supplied by NASA and
   JPL.  We furnish teachers with asummaryhandout sheet including URLs.
   <h>WORKSHEETS and EVALUATION SHEETS:
   <p>Most teachers have requested use of worksheets for classes at 5th
   gradeleveland higher.  We normally bring a fill-in-the-blank style
   worksheetforduplication and distribution at start of class.
   <p>We can send the master to you ahead of time if you wish to print
   itbeforehand.
   Sometimes we encourage students to use a blank piece of paper and
   thenwemake notes together on a projected window from the laptop.
   <p>We supply a key for the teacher for use in review after the class.
   <p>We also bring a page for students with a few questions to fill out
   forfeedbackfor us on how the classes can be improved, and we supply
   teachers withamore detailed questionaire.  These surveys can be mailed
   back tomeand are usually done for homework or the next day, as our
   sessionsusuallyrun the whole class period.
   <h>PREP VIDEO
   <p>Tom Cleveland, of Think Video/Lane Community Cable Television, and
   I,haveput together a 28-minute introductory video for use prior to
   theoutreachsessions, or as a stand-alone INTRODUCTION to EXPLORING
   DEEPSPACE. The material is suitable for ALL grade levels, but
   particularlysuitablefor Elementary and Middle School.  We start with a
   briefintroductionto the emptiness of space by taking an imaginary
   flight upward fromEarth,noting the results and requirements of leaving
   the atmosphere andrunningout of air.
   <p>Next we cover, using models, the vocabulary of Moon, Planet,
   Star/Sun,SolarSystem, Nebula, Galaxy, and Universe.  Then we create a
   scalemodelof the Solar System and beyond on a real football field, an
   activityyoucan duplicate.
   <p>Finally we explore the basic concepts of light, introducing viewers
   totheterm "photons", and noting that to "see" anything we need a
   source ofphotonsand a detector of photons (stars and our eyes).  We
   tie the wholeprogramtogether with a final demonstration with a
   flashlight to show howphotonsfrom a distant source spread out, thus
   why objects in deep space are sodim,so hard to explore.
   <p>The actual classroom outreach program then gives the students
   theopportunitiesto explore the collection/detection/measuring
   technologies (telescopesandCCD cameras) and includes computer labs
   where actual research can bedone.
   When you contact me to schedule your outreach session, I'll mail you
   aprepvideo along with several worksheets and answer keys to complement
   thevideo. I'll pick up the video when I come to your classroom.  There
   is nocostfor the video, but we do need it returned.
   <p>Responses have been very positive from Elementary and
   MiddleSchoolers. Most High School students have felt that the video
   was too simplisticforthem, although some have commented that the
   concepts/overview have beenveryhelpful.
   <p>Our major concern is that students have the overview of vast
   distances,hierarchy/vocabularyof types of objects, and initial
   exposure to concept of photons for thetechnologyprogram, as we don't
   have time within the class to cover thesetopics. For example, the
   students should understand the difference between aSolarSystem and a
   Galaxy, functionally, in appearance, and in scale.
   <p>If you don't wish to go this route or don't have enough time to get
   thevideomailed to you, I can attach a basic vocabulary/distance scales
   infosheetto an e-mail message to you, or you can find this document at
   theFriendsof PMO web site.
   <p>We will also be creating a video that demonstrates the use of
   FITSVIEWandAIP4WIN image analysis software.  This will be distributed
   asfollow-upmaterials for students interested in pursuing a research
   project usingdigitalimages of the sky.
   <h>SOLAR VIEWING:
   <p>We now have a standard solar filter for the 6" telescope that I
   bringtoclassrooms, so if the sky is clear, there is potentially
   theopportunityto view sunspots.  We can set up the telescope outside
   before orafterclass or during lunch or recess.  This is not an H-alpha
   filterlikewe have at Pine Mountain that shows the solar prominences,
   but thestandardfilter still offers very interesting views of the solar
   "surface"features. Queing up to view through the telescope takes time,
   so this usuallydoesn'twork well during a class period as too many
   students are left idle, butiscertainly suitable as a supplemental
   before/after class/school activity.
   <h>REQUESTS FOR SKY VIEWING IN EVENING:
   <p>Occasionally schools request an evening sky observing program
   inconjunctionwith the classroom outreach.  This may be feasible,
   working withyourlocal Astronomy Club/Astronomical Society, or with any
   other localpeoplewho can bring large telescopes.  We can set up the
   portable CCDCameraon a table outside, and students have a great time
   taking actual imagesofsome of the larger objects in the sky, such as
   galaxies, star clusters,andnebulas.  We can discuss the arrangements
   for each requestspecifically,as resources vary considerably around the
   State.
   <h>VIRTUAL REALITY (VR) Sun-Earth-Moon (SEM) project:
   <p>Oregon Research Institute (ORI), in Eugene, has created a VR
   programwherethe user can "fly" his/her craft around, above, and below
   the Sun,Earth,and Moon (other planets may be added later).  The goal
   is for theuserto conceptualize the motions, orientations, and views of
   these objectsbybeing able to gain a wide variety of physical
   perspectives not normallyavailable. Explorations include phases of the
   Moon and the orbits and periods oftheEarth and Moon and their
   relationships to the position of theSun. This program, called SEM, is
   funded by the Federal Department ofEducation. ORI Prime Investigator,
   Dr. Dean Inman, wrote the grant as a programdesignedto help
   Orthopedically Impaired (OI) students do science labs that
   theyordinarilywould not be able to access.
   <p>When I saw the software in early Summer, 2002, I was immediately
   struckthatnon-OI students should also be able to put these
   explorations to gooduse,and also noted that the software serves to
   illustrate many of the ODE'sEarth-in-Spacebenchmarks.
   <p>I am now working with ORI to develop teacher and student materials
   foruseof the SEM program, and will be introducing SEM in many of my
   outreachclasses. Dr. Inman and I will be looking for teachers who are
   interested incollaboratingto investigate the efficacy of SEM,
   comparing how students learn withconventionalstrategies versus SEM,
   for both OI and regular students.
   The software is free and is available either as a download off the
   webfrom or
   from a CD-ROMthat ORI can send you.   Fed Ed has also funded
   availabilityofhigh video performance computers from ORI for classrooms
   wishing toparticipate. Please contact me if you are interested in
   participating, whether ornotyou have OI students.
   <h>RESEARCH PROJECTS:
   <h>Inquiry-based RESEARCHPROJECTS for ALL GRADE LEVELS:
   <p>Digital data can be used by students of all ages.  Here are
   somesuggestedprojects that we can assist you to implement in your
   classroom. Dependingon student academic levels, you could use/adapt
   several projects at awidevariety of grade levels.
   <p>The projects can begin as inquiries after viewing some initial
   digitalimagesof the sky (or viewing the real sky for that matter!)  If
   you comeupwith your own project, we can assist you with data and data
   analysissoftware. We can demonstrate a basic project listed below
   during outreach and canthenwalk your students through the project in
   your computer lab.
   <p>a. How many stars (how many galaxies)?
   Starting from a rudimentary counting exercise, students can
   exploreimagesfrom various areas of the sky and images taken with a
   variety ofexposuretimes.  Questions can be generated concerning
   distribution ofobjects,types of objects, and how much of what's out
   there we are really abletosee, why and why not.  This is a very
   open-ended project that canbea real eye-opener to the vastness of
   space and the nature of howscienceis done and is very suitable for
   lower elementary grade levels.
   <p>b. Do any objects shift position in the sky?
   <p>This involves astrometric (positional) measurements, over a period
   oftime. Starting by "blinking" (comparing) images of the same area of
   sky overoneor more nights, students can search for objects that shift
   relativepositionand then attempt to explain the shift observed.
   Students canderivethe basic relationship between distance and
   parallactic shift and thussortout Solar System objects versus Galactic
   objects, discover asteroids,andcan begin to sort out the various
   planets at various distances andapproximatethe orbital radii.
   <p>See the astrometric project, initiated by Silverton High
   SchoolTeacher,Ray Kaser, described as the computer lab option in the
   Contents ofOutreachSessions section above.
   <p>Another astrometric project involves the search for asteroids. Thisis
   an authentic research project with potentially very useful
   results(savingEarth!).  Students can request data or can scan
   archiveddata. Best done with Richard Berry's AIP4WIN image analysis
   software, whichwhencombined with a digital database, will allow the
   user to accuratelydeterminecoordinates of any candidates.  Data can
   then be compared withlistof known objects compiled by Lowell
   Observatory, and if object is trulyanew discovery, the discoverer may
   participate in the naming of theobject.
   <p>c. Why are some objects brighter than others?
   <p>This involves photometric (brightness) measurements and leads
   tomeasurementof distances, temperatures, sizes, and brings up issues
   of instrumentcalibration. At the basic level, students can intuitively
   conceptualize therelationshipsand can begin to characterize and
   classify objects in the sky.
   <p>We have archived sets of data of stars of several constellations,
   whichcanbe measured for relative brightnesses.
   At more advanced levels, we can furnish images filtered in
   variouscolors(BVR) which would lead to measurement of temperature from
   the PlanckBlackbodyCurve and ultimately to construction of an H-R
   diagram and determiningstellarage.
   <h>REQUEST or DOWNLOAD DATA (IMAGES of the SKY):
   <p>Archived data can be "FTPd" (we like WS_FTP software to do this)
   or"Timbuktud"(Timbuktu software from www.netopia.com) from IP
   128.223.164.30.
   <p>Contact Rick (rkang@efn.org) foruser name/password.
   <p>Also contact Rick if you want to acquire new data either from
   ourCOWCAM(1/2 degree FOV, BVR filters available, 1Kx1K
   pixel CCD, 5 Meg FITS format images) or from our PIGGY (1 degree
   FOV,nofilters, 242x375 pixel CCD, 300 KB FITS format images), we may
   be ablesoset up remote imaging sessions for you.
   We encourage you to select suitable targets and to furnish us with
   theidentity,RA/DEC, and desired integration time and filters for
   yourtargets. We can provide an initial digital sky tour if you wish.
   <p>There is a $20 charge to set up a remote imaging session, and you
   willneedto have Timbuktu software (from)running
   on your computer. There may be local firewall issues to resolve.
   <p>See the FOPMO web site for links to DATA ANALYSIS SOFTWARE

   <h>HOW TO BRING YOUR CLASS TO PINE MOUNTAIN OBSERVATORY:
   <h>DETAILS FOR OBSERVATORY TOURS:
   <p>Please make advance reservation with Mark
   Dunaway,markpmo@oregon.uoregon.eduor 541-382-8331 if you are planning
   to bring your class (or any grouplargerthan 10 people) during regular
   tour season
   (Fri-Sat evenings Memorial Day weekend through September, or during
   the off season).
   <p>We are now closed due to winter weather, but come March or April if
   the
   snows don't make the road impassable, you may be able to bring
   yourgroup
   to PMO if Mark can fit you in...dark moon weekends fill quickly).

   <p>Program starts at dusk, check with Mark for exact times as may
   changeasdarkness falls later or ealier.  Also check with Mark on
   rates,we'vehad to increase our group rates as we've had to find
   funding for stafftodrive up.  We're trying to hold regular Fri-Sat
   summertime drop inratesto $3.00/visitor.   Dress warmly (can easily
   get belowfreezingat the 6500 foot elevation!) and bring a small
   flashlight covered withredcellophane or a brown paper bag (to protect
   everyone's nightvision). We furnish star charts.  You can stay up with
   us all night,weatherpermitting.  Check the web site for Quick Cam
   views of the weatherduringdaylight before you come up.  There is a
   Forest Service campgroundjustacross the parking lot from the
   Observatory, first come, first served,noreservations, no fees.
   Primitive campground, you need to bringwater.
   <p>Some schools have made arrangements with teachers at local Bend
   schools to use their gym to camp out in.
   Try to pick a non-Full Moon night (moon is very bright and washes
   outfainterobjects).
   <p>For further details, see the How to Visit PMO link and/or
   call541-382-8331.

   <h>OBSERVATORY TELESCOPE STATUS:
   <p>15" Telescope now has digital setting circles, making finding
   objectsmucheasier.
   <p>24" Telescope has minor tracking problems in some positions,
   wecontinueto work on this, but telescope and PIGGY CCD are basically
   in service.
   <p>32" Telescope continues to be available for limited collection
   ofresearchdata with the COWCAM, including images filtered with B, V,
   or Rfilters. Contact Rick with your initial proposal, I'll put you in
   touch withProfessorBothun to work out the details.
   <p>Solar Viewing: We now have an H-alpha solar filter for use on
   ourportable8" telescope, that allows visitors during daytime to view
   the hugeprominencesblasted out by the Sun.  Normally we have this
   telescope set upoutsidethe 24" dome on Saturday afternoons, 2-5 PM
   during the regularVisitors'Season.
