<h>* Brush-B-Gone / Roundup
       <p>Mixed it according to label recommendations, then you probablywill
       get a good kill of the parts you sprayed. The first sign is
       curling andtwisting (epinasty in plant physiology terms), and it
       may take a week ortwo to look real dead. Some resprouting may
       occur from areas of the rootsystem that the chemical did not
       reach. Respray after these sprouts reach8 or 10 inches (too soon
       and there may not be enough leaf area to absorbenough chemical).
       Triclopyr (the active chemical) is sooo much moreeffective on
       woody plants than Roundup. But it really does little to killgrass
       family plants, or rosette type weeds that are already bolting.

       <p>We just bought a piece of property and it has poison oak. It is
       covering a huge granite rock about 8 foot tall and 30 foot around.
       It is also growing between the rocks to the height of 10 to 12
       feet and also growing like a vine over the rocks. I got two spots
       the first time. It is maddening to itch like that. I went out and
       bought a gallon of round up. The kind you dilute with water to the
       correct consistency. I sprayed that huge plant. It has been
       reduced to dead leaves and dead branches. I used about one forth
       of the gallon to do the job. The gallon cost $85.00 but even
       though I am on a limited budget it was worth every penny. And I
       still have enough round up just in case it comes back up. Then I
       was clearing a spot on another part of our property and got it
       again. The first two places to break out were the ones where it
       was before and then it spread. Tonight I actually took a bath in
       diluted bleach. Tomorrow I am going to go spray that new plant.
       Thanks for your web site about the evils of poison oak and ivy.

       <p>I have found Brush-B-Gone foam to be the best product for
       complete, easy removal of Poison Ivy. It is sometimes hard to
       find, perhaps they're discontinuing the foam? One can removed all
       the Poison Ivy in our large backyard with one application per
       plant (including a vine running some 20+ feet up a tree, about 4"
       around at base), and because it's a foam it is much easier to not
       hit plants you don't want to kill.

       <p>My comment is about Round-up, and its use on Poison Ivy etc. Guys,
       Round-Up doesn't work!! It's just that simple. It kills the upper
       leaves, but the roots remain. This product is a complete rip, and
       we are wasting our $$. And not just poison ivy, round up won't
       kill grass long term. What does work? Pick axes, hoes, gloves you
       wear for roses, and washing in cold water within one hour of known
       exposure.

       <p>Editor: It is true that you might have to re-apply round-up but it
       will eventually kill poison ivy completely as I now have acres of
       no poison ivy to prove it. I have had to repeat my applications up
       to 3 times on some very resilient plants over a summer. You will
       not kill the big vines though and will need to cut a segment and
       use a herbicide containing triclopyr for those tough guys.
       Pick axes, hoes, and gloves are a sure thing. The other nice thing
       about your comments is that its better for the environment and
       doesn't cost any money! Thank you.
       <p>I have used Roundup, etc for poison ivy, oak, but the only thing
       that I have found to really "kill" poison oak or ivy is
       Brush-B-Gone!!

<h>* General Discussion
       <p>Contact with poison ivy can leave you with a rash and persistent
       itch. This native perennial grows throughout Virginia, in woods,
       fields, andsometimes in the garden. It grows in sun or shade,and
       in wet or dry places. Its growth habit depends on where itis
       growing, resulting in a trailing ground cover, free-standingshrub,
       or a vine supported by trees, shrubbery and fences.
       <p>All parts of the poison ivy plant contain an oil, urushiol, which
       causesthe allergic reaction. Most poisoning occur during
       thegrowing season when the presence of lush foliage increases
       thechance of contact, but the dormant stems and roots of the
       vinecan cause winter poisoning as well. Individuals vary in
       theirsensitivity to poison ivy, but repeated exposure can lead
       toincreased sensitivity. It would be a good idea for everyone
       toavoid this plant.
       <p>Poison ivy appears in many forms. The leaflets vary in
       size,glossiness, and marginal notching, but always occur in groups
       of three. If you avoid all unknown plants with leaves composed
       ofthree leaflets, you will be playing it safe.
       Poison ivy is difficult but not impossible to eradicate. Thechief
       difficulty lies in the chances of becoming poisoned whentrying to
       remove it. Wear protective clothing, including gloves, wheneveryou
       are working near it. Pulling and grubbing areeffective means of
       removal, though they necessitate close contact and willprobably
       need to be repeated once or twice for complete control. If timeis
       not an object, the vines can be smothered by completely covering
       themwith black plastic for several months.Do not mow the plants as
       this will spew bits and pieces ofpoisonous material over the area.
       When removing poison ivy, takefrequent breaks to change clothes
       and scrub thoroughly with astrong soap. Wash contaminated clothing
       separately. DO NOT BURN anyplants that you physically remove. The
       resulting smoke cancause severe lung damage if inhaled.
       <p>Herbicides are effective and allow you to control the plantwithout
       getting too close to it. Several commercial products are
       available. Check labels to find one that will control poisonivy,
       and apply it as directed. Many of the herbicides for poison
       ivycontrol contain glyphosate. This chemical is systemic. Itis
       absorbed by leaves and transferred to stems and roots, andslowly
       causes the death of the entire plant. It must be applied to
       anactively growing plant for this process to take place; donot
       apply it during a drought when even poison ivy will not begrowing.
       Glyphosate, like most herbicides labelled for poisonivy removal,
       is nonselective and will kill any other plants itcontacts.
       <p>Where poison ivy has grown up tree trunks or into hedges, cut the
       vineat ground level. Remove as much of the stump and roots asyou
       can with a hoe or by pulling. As regrowth occurs, apply
       anherbicide to the leaves, or keep pulling up the growth.
       Withperseverance, and probably of few itches, poison ivy can
       becontrolled.

<h>* Household mixtures to kill poison ivy plants
       <p>Here is one I found. Mix 3 pounds salt with1 Gallon soapy water;
       spray the solution on the plant's leaves and stems.I have also
       used a combination of roundup and letting nature choke the
       plant(ie. wild rose) myself.
       <h>--Editor (July/27/1999)
       <p>I'm an environmentally sensitive landscaper and landscape designer
       with agood deal of experience in eliminating poison ivy from the
       landscape. And,little as I like the prospect of using an
       herbicide, out of considerationsboth for my personal health and
       for the environment, the only way I've foundto get rid of
       substantial colonies of poison ivy is by the careful
       andresponsible use of herbicide.
       <p>You can remove a single young plant or two by grasping it through
       a plasticgarbage bag and pulling it up root and all. Turn the bag
       inside-out over theplant, and it's done. (You may have some growth
       return from broken roots,but can get rid of them in the same way.)
       <p>Glyphosate--the active ingredient in Roundup and Rodeo--is
       sometimesrecommended for killing poison ivy. Because its active
       ingredient breaksdown quickly, I initially tried to use Round-up,
       but found that plants couldrecover from as many as six
       applications over two years. Others with whomI've compared notes
       also describe similar experiences. I've only used theproduct as
       sold, with glyphosate.
       <p>The only thing that seems to work, in my experience, is a
       herbicidecontaining triclopyr. I've used Ortho Brush-b-Gon with a
       great deal ofsuccess. If I'm careful, I find I can spot-treat
       individual plants withoutdoing much damage to what's growing
       around them. For greater accuracy,instead of spraying you can
       paint the herbicide directly on the leaves.
       <p>I hate to sound like a spokesperson for Monsanto. This company has
       many sinsto answer for. And, as I've said above, I'm reluctant to
       use herbicides. Butthis product really does the job.
       <p>Use it with respect. Read the label and follow the directions
       religiously.Wait for a day when the winds are still. Don't use it
       in or within ten feetof a wetland. Use rubber gloves, and be
       careful not to breathe the spray.Wash up thoroughly afterwards,
       and put your clothes in the wash right away.
       <p>I strongly recommend against using salt to kill plants. Yes, we
       use salt inour food. But in the environment, in the quantities
       required, it's toxic andpersistent--much more so than Roundup or
       Brush-b-Gon. It does not breakdown, and will continue to kill
       anything planted on the spot until it'sthoroughly leached away--a
       matter of years even in regions of high rainfall.And even then, it
       continues to be a hazard, as it leaches into thegroundwater. Using
       it is much more environmentally damaging than usingherbicides
       whose sale for the purpose is allowed by the EPA.
       <h>--Don Galbreath submitted 23/Dec/2000
       <p>Editor: Thanks Don for an excellent discussion! I have been using
       Roundup exclusivelyhere on a little more than 2 acres and while it
       takes repeated spraying I have had reasonable results because it
       contains the ivy long enough that other more invasive plants can
       choke it out. I am in year 4 of what I call myexperimental program
       and would call it a success this far given that Ihave elminated
       about 1/4 acre of just poison ivy plants. I have tocompletely
       agree that the Ortho Brush-b-Gon product is incredible and I apply
       it with a paint brush to all large old growth stems.
       <p>"Glyphosate" will kill it. It I guess is the active ingredient
       insystemic killers. I wonder if it can be bought "over the
       counter" insteadof in "round-up", etc.

       <p>Here is my way of getting back at that nasty plant and you don't
       have to spend alot of money...you need:
<l>1 cup of salt,
<l>8 drops of liquid detergent,
<l>1 gallon of vinegar,
       <p>combine the salt and vinegar in a pan heat it up to dissolve the
       salt pour intoa spray bottle and kill away. Warning this will kill
       all plants that you spray so don't spray anything important good
       luck.

<h>* Large Area Control
       <p>I use the following on poison ivy, if it is in a place where I
       want to get rid of it:
         <l>1. Growing in an open area (ie. field, etc.) - Mow it with the
            brush hog. After a while, if you mow it regularly, it will
            die.
         <l>2. Growing up a tree - Cut the vine. If it is really big, use
            achainsaw. If it is smaller, use what we call "nippers" (long
            handled shear like tool).
         <l>3. Occasionally, if it is growing in a place where either 1 or 2
            won't work, I spray it. For example, sometimes it will grow
            on the side of an outbuilding, but the vines are too small
            and numerous to cut easily. I use concentrated roundup
            diluted in water to the manufacturer'sspecifications and
            spray it. It always works for me.As far as getting rid of the
            rash, only time works for me.
       <h>--(Rob Gray@NOSPAMAlpha.injersey.com) submitted Jun/26/1999
       <p>Editor: I use a similiar approach but choose to use a bow saw for
       thebig vines as I am worried about the chainsaw throwing more oil
       around.
   
<h>* Goats
       <p>Goats. Goats do an excellent job of cleaning out poison ivy
       andother unwanted brush, especially when its growing up in the
       fenceline.

<h>* Mulch, Tarps, Pulling
       <p>I've taken out long-established vines with trunksas big as your
       arm with but two or three strategic,thorough cuttings and a bit of
       digging and pulling. I carefully note locations of major vine
       coloniesin the middle of winter here, when they're easierto see
       and brittle to cut as well.One had completely covered a large
       stone retaining wall,at the bank to the ramp to the main barn
       loft. In winterI removed major sections of matted vines from the
       stones,after cutting all along the perimeter of the wall. I
       threwmulch hay along the top of the wall and it killed the
       poisonivy there without further ado.I knew that there'd be a good
       burst of new growth from the base of the big vine I chopped away
       and dug out, but part of thatwould be mowed as part of the yard
       and the other would bethe rest of the project. More runners would
       pull up asthe ground thawed, too.Then I waited until the leaf
       growth was as good as it couldbe before the seeds form. I cut the
       vines twice each with asharp action of the corn knife, two or more
       inches apart,digging aside the cut section. That takes only
       minutes.I usually let it rot in place or at least wilt down toa
       dry brown before removing it to a composting areafor ornamental,
       non-food uses. The seeds are a bigsource of food for birds and end
       up under trees to alarge extent, so thick mulches can be used in
       placeswhere mowing isn't practical, as long as they don'textend
       right up to the trees.I search for separate smaller vines and pull
       them to find alltheir branches. It's often easy that way to get
       most of the ivy in a big area just by first locating a small
       number ofwell-spread vines. I have a spading fork, rake, and
       hayhook that I use to lift stubborn vines rather than cutinto the
       dirt with the knife. I also use nippers tofinish off each and
       every smaller sprout in the area.At most I'll check it to remove
       any resprouts, once,later in the season.If I remove a plant I
       replace it with something else,and I'll mulch heavily and position
       the replacementsonce I see that the growth is all browned out.
       Thisis a plant that gets as indignant as any hothouseornamental if
       you demonstrate your willingness tocut away at it with some
       persistence. It enjoysthick mulches even less. Hell, I've killed
       somevines just by dropping scrap visqueen and tarpson them, which
       do the job in a season or twoand can be hidden under mulch until
       removed. One big cluster of vines used to live under a spotwhere I
       subsequently stored a couple tons of cypressbark, but it didn't
       seem to thrive at all once it wasunder a few feet of slow-rotting
       mill byproduct ...

<h>* Never Burn Poison Ivy
       <p>Bag the plants, roots and debris in plastic, thentake to the
       dumpster or land fill. NEVER, NEVER,NEVER try to burn poison ivy
       out or add to a burnpile. Smoke can and will carry the poison.
       Thisdoes damage lung tissue and can lead to a longhospital visit
       or death. If you ever do burn out anarea of brush, stay out of the
       smoke. There may bepoison ivy that you don't see.

<h>Remove from other Items
       <p>Hi,Just wanted to thank you profusely for your site. Tons of
       useful information (more than I got from WebMD.) Most useful were
       the pictures (instead of the illustrations you tend to find
       elsewhere) which helped me realize I had more than one
       kind/growing habit of poison ivy growing in my yard. It took
       awhile, but eventually I found possible ways of washing the oil
       off my upholstry (you can't exactly throw a possibly contaminated
       couch into the washing machine.) Perhaps, if you've the time, a
       "section" on removing the oil from more than your hands and
       clothing would be useful. And lastly, simply reading about others
       who have gone through the same suffering as much (and more) than I
       am, has helped mentally. Thanks again :-) and much praise for your
       site :-)--Heidi m., a sufferer in central New Jersey

       <p>Editor: I would think it would come off rather easily withany
       cleaner that is good with oil. Even plain old water. The problem
       with the skin is that once the oil bonds, it is verydifficult to
       remove. Not a problem with furniture, tools, etc.Anyone else?

<h>Ammonium Sulfamate
       <p>I'm fascinated that in all your site and the other sites you
       hotlink, there's absolutely no mention of ammonium sulfamate, sold
       under the trade name of ammate among others. My 'job' when
       visiting my grandparents in ipswich was to fill up the 2-gal
       pressure sprayer every morning and roam around their 75 ac looking
       for p.i., and I did that for many years. Like glyphosate, it
       needed several applications at two-week intervals, but in my
       experience it was very effective. I know enough chemstry to
       appreciate its relative safety, and in my experience it's
       extremely selective, killing only the p.i. I can remember spraying
       it on a vine growing through a highbush blueberry and seeing only
       the p.i. leaves wilt. I'm very !$!#!$ that it seems to be
       completely unavailable now - perhaps because it's too cheap and
       commodity-like to be profitable when glyphosate and triclopyr can
       be sold instead? I'm tempted to try making it. I don't think it'd
       be too hard. My other grandmother swore by phenolic soap ['fels
       naptha'] for removing urushiol before the itch started, back in
       the '60s.
