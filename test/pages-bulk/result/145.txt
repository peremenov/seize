   <h>Patient Assistance Programs:
   <h>Do They Really Help the Uninsured ?
   <h>A report by Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum

   <h>The Facts on Prescription Drug Costs
   <p>According to the Census Bureau, approximately 41.2 million Americans
   lacked health insurance in 2002. At the local level, the United
   Hospital Fund reported that there were approximately 1.6 million
   uninsured New York City residents in 2000, most of whom are low-income
   and working.   They also found that one out of four New York City
   residents under the age of 65 were uninsured.

   <p>Many of these low-income uninsured individuals face considerable cost
   barriers to obtaining needed medications and must often pay full price
   for prescription drugs.  Uninsured non-elderly Americans spent
   approximately $20 more out-of- pocket per prescription in 1997
   compared to the insured non-elderly.  According to the Fiscal Policy
   Institute, while the cost of all drugs is increasing, brand name drugs
   are increasing even more rapidly, rising by 10.5 times between 1998
   and 2000.

   <p>With pharmaceuticals playing an increasingly important role in health
   treatment plans these days, it is alarming to see pharmaceutical costs
   escalate over the years.

   <p>The high costs of prescription drugs have caused many uninsured
   individuals to take less medication than they were prescribed.
   According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 41 percent of uninsured
   individuals did not fill a prescription because of costs.

   <p>As rising drug prices force more and more low-income uninsured
   individuals to make trade-offs between their medications and basic
   living costs, pharmaceutical companies continue to make profits.   The
   pharmaceutical industry was the most profitable of all industries on
   the annual 2001 Fortune 500 list, with the top ten Fortune 500 drug
   companies earning $37.2 billion in profits in 2001, up from $28.0
   billion reported in 2000.


   <h>History of Patient Assistance Programs
   <p>Through their patient assistance programs (PAPs), many drug
   manufacturers claim to offer free medication to low-income individuals
   who do not have public or private prescription drug coverage.   These
   programs have been in existence for more than twenty years.


   <h>The Facts on Patient Assistance Programs
   <p>While PAPs alone cannot solve all the problems facing low-income
   individuals lacking prescription drug coverage, the office of the
   Public Advocate wanted to explore the extent to which PAPs can help
   alleviate the cost of rising prescription drugs for low-income
   uninsured New Yorkers.   To this end, the following seven PAPs were
   examined:
     <l>o Astra Zeneca
     <l>o Abbott
     <l>o Pfizer
     <l>o Pharmacia
     <l>o Bristol Myers Squibb
     <l>o Merck
     <l>o Schering-Plough
   <p>These PAPs were chosen because they offer the following ten commonly
   prescribed drugs in New York :
     <l>o Lipitor
     <l>o Prilosec
     <l>o Glucophage
     <l>o Celebrex
     <l>o Zocor
     <l>o Claritin
     <l>o Synthroid
     <l>o Zoloft
     <l>o Zantac
     <l>o Vasotec
   <h>Findings
   <p>Despite the fact that PAPs claim to give away an estimated two billion
   dollars in free medication every year, our overall observations were
   disappointing.
     <h>o PAPs rarely publicize eligibility requirements

   <p>Pharmaceutical companies offer free prescription pharmaceuticals to
   those who fit their eligibility guidelines.   These guidelines are
   based on set income and asset levels as well as eligibility for
   prescription drug coverage, public or private.   That is, low-income
   individuals who do not have any prescription drugs coverage, public or
   private, would qualify for these patient assistance programs if they
   satisfy the income eligibility requirements.

   <p>Unfortunately, we found that only two of the seven pharmaceutical
   companies we reviewed, Pfizer and Merck, made their income eligibility
   guidelines public.   Single New Yorkers with annual income levels of
   $16,000 or less and families with incomes less than $25,000 are
   eligible for the Pfizer Patient Assistance Program.   Merck's Patient
   Assistance Program has a higher income eligibility threshold than
   Pfizer, allowing singles with income less than $18,000 and families
   with an income of $24,000 to qualify for the program.

   <p>Since the annual Medicaid income eligibility limit for single
   individuals is $7,704 and $11,400 for a family of four, the Pfizer and
   Merck PAPs could certainly help meet the prescription needs of
   individuals who do not qualify for Medicaid, but earn too little to
   afford private prescription coverage.

   <p>Eligibility guidelines existed for the five remaining PAPs, but they
   refused to make them public.   Decisions are made on a case-by-case
   basis, at the discretion of the pharmaceutical company.

   <p>Without knowing the eligibility guidelines, uninsured individuals and
   their heath care providers cannot easily determine if they are
   eligible.
     <h>o Additional documentation required

   <p>Although application forms for most PAPs are only two pages long, they
   require the applicant to fill out detailed financial information.
   Four out of the seven programs required applicants to include
   additional documentation.   For example, Pfizer, Pharmacia, Abbott,
   and Schering-Plough require applicants to include documentation for
   all sources of income including tax returns, pay stubs and W-2s. Those
   applicants without an income must include a note from their physician
   or social worker attesting to that fact.
       <h>o Getting Medication Takes Time

   <p>The process of getting the medication, from the moment the application
   is sent to the time the drugs are received by applicants, takes an
   average of three weeks for a trouble-free application. Only Pharmacia
   has a system where applicants are immediately able to access thirty
   days supply of medication. Bristol Myers Squibb takes a longer time,
   with applicants receiving medications in 2-3 weeks. For others like
   Astra Zeneca, Merck, Schering-Plough, Abbott and Pfizer, it takes 4-6
   weeks to get the medications. Patients in immediate need of medicines
   may not benefit greatly from these programs.

     <h>o Most PAPs Do Not Send Medication Directly to Applicants

   <p>Our review of the seven PAPs found that a majority of them (57%) did
   not send the approved medication directly to the applicants, even
   though the applicants obviously had their doctor's approval.   Only
   Astra Zeneca sends the medication directly to their applicants, while
   Pharmacia allows approved applicants to pick up their medication at a
   participating drug store.   Merck leaves it up to the physician to
   indicate whom the medication will be sent to.


   <h>Recommendations
   <p>With the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals sky-rocketing out of
   control, patient assistance programs could certainly play a role in
   helping low-income individuals who lack private prescription coverage.
     However, their ability to help meet the medication needs of
   low-income uninsured individuals falls far short of their potential.
   In order for PAPs to fully reach their potential, the Public Advocate
   recommends the following:

   <p>Increase Public Awareness of Patient Assistance Programs: While many
   PAPs have existed for the past two decades, very few people know of
   them.   For example, out of an estimated 77,000 health care provider
   offices in New York State , only 4,943 used the Pfizer Patient
   Assistance Program in 2002.

   <p>As prices soared for the average pharmaceutical consumer, the industry
   saw the highest profits for any industry in 2001.  Furthermore,
   marketing staff at major U.S pharmaceutical manufacturers have
   increased by 59 percent since 1995. Clearly, pharmaceutical companies
   have marketing resources at their disposal necessary to increase
   physician and patient awareness of the available assistance programs.
   They must utilize these resources.

   <p>Make Eligibility Requirements Publicly Available
   Since many of the PAPs do not publicize their income eligibility
   requirements, it is often very difficult for potential applicants and
   their health care providers to determine their eligibility.   This
   obstacle may deter many from applying. Therefore, clear eligibility
   guidelines should be made public.

   <p>Forego Additional Documentation Requests : Several PAP programs like
   Astra Zeneca and Bristol Myers Squibb do not require additional
   documentation with their applications. This reduces the amount of
   paperwork applicants and their physicians must complete, making the
   application process quicker. PAPs should not require additional
   documentation with their application forms.

   <p>Ship Medication Directly to Patients : Sending medication shipments
   directly to the patient saves the applicant from having to visit the
   doctor's office repeatedly.

   <p>Speedy Access to Medication : Pharmacia has a program called "Patients
   in Need" that allows applicants to apply over the telephone and get
   immediate access to medication.

   <p>Applicants meeting the eligibility criteria are immediately approved
   for a 30-day supply of medication over the phone.   The applicants
   must then visit their physician's office to get their prescriptions
   and completion of the application forms. Once they have their
   prescriptions, they can pick up a 30-day supply of medication from a
   participating pharmacy.   The pharmacy charges the applicant a
   dispensing fee of $5.

   <p>As soon as Pharmacia receives the application forms, the approval
   determination for a continued supply is conducted.   This usually
   takes around 3-4 weeks.   Pharmacia then mails the pharmacy card
   directly to the patient.

   <p>Other PAPs should implement a similar system to ensure that applicants
   have speedy access to medication.

   <h>Conclusion
   <p>The pharmaceutical industry is the most profitable industry in the
   United States. They continue to see record profits at the expense of
   the American consumer and therefore have the responsibility to keep
   medicine affordable for all people, especially for our low-income
   consumers. It is not enough for pharmaceutical companies to proclaim
   corporate responsibility as a public relations ploy; they must back it
   up with real action. Working to maximize the potential of PAPs would
   be a start.
