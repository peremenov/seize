   <p>Socialists don't usually like to use the word 'charisma'. It pays too
   much attention to the individual and not enough to the circumstances
   that create those individuals who compel the attention of others. But
   it is tempting to make an exception for Edward Said.

<h>Powerful

   <p>Anyone who heard Edward Said speak in recent years could not but be
   mesmerised by the breadth of his vision, the depth of his learning,
   the way his compassion for Palestine was actively helping to
   universalise its struggle, his anger at the rulers of the world. Here
   was this very frail man, who for the last 12 years knew that he was
   dying from leukaemia, speaking in sober, almost subdued tones. Never a
   hint of demagogy, he had just an obvious, moral compunction to tell
   the truth. He might illustrate his talk with a quote from a Jane
   Austen novel, or with a passage from the Italian Marxist Antonio
   Gramsci, or, quite remarkably, at Westminster Central Hall in London a
   couple of years ago, to an audience of nearly 1,500 people, with a
   series of huge maps to demolish the fraud behind the Oslo 'peace'
   agreement (laced with a stinging indictment of the Palestinian
   leadership who had allowed the Israeli map makers to outmanoeuvre
   them).

   <p>There is a wonderful irony that the man who made a lifetime study of
   the historical misuse of the power of knowledge by the ruling classes
   in the west was himself able to put his own powerful knowledge at the
   disposal of the dispossessed. Of course, this meant mainly the
   Palestinians. But what had really excited Edward Said at the turn of
   the new century was the way in which Palestine had globalised. The
   Palestinian flag now has to adorn worldwide protest against
   globalisation and war. As he wrote in his last essay 'Dignity,
   Solidarity and the Penal Colony', with death fast approaching, 'In the
   past six months I have lectured in four continents to many thousands
   of people. What brings them together is Palestine and the struggle of
   the Palestinian people which is now a byword for emancipation and
   enlightenment, regardless of all the vilification heaped on them by
   their enemies.

   <p>'It is an extraordinary thing that Palestine was a central issue this
   year both during the Porto Alegre anti-globalisation meetings as well
   as during the Davos and Amman meetings, both poles of the worldwide
   political spectrum.'

   <p>This essay drew its inspiration simultaneously from the cascading
   horrors of everyday life in Palestine and the troubled mind of the
   dissident Jewish Czech writer Franz Kafka.

   <p>'There is a remarkable story by Kafka, In the Penal Colony, about a
   crazed official who shows off a fantastically detailed torture machine
   whose purpose is to write all over the body of the victim, using a
   complex apparatus of needles to inscribe the captive's body with
   minute letters that ultimately causes the prisoner to bleed to death.
   This is what Sharon and his brigades of willing executioners are doing
   to the Palestinians.'

   <p>But Edward Said went to his grave confident that the Palestinians
   would never give in to it.

   <p>Edward Said read, absorbed and fully appreciated much of the greatest
   literary, philosophical and political works that underpin what we
   sometimes call western civilisation. But the word western, as a
   description of this civilisation, troubled him deeply. It suggested a
   flaw. He summoned all his erudition, eloquence and gravitas to expose
   it.

   <p>His objection was that western civilisation had misused its knowledge.
   He spells it out in his most important work, Orientalism. Some left
   wing critics have baulked at the influence of postmodernism on the
   book. But, although this does make the book sometimes difficult to
   read, the sheer power of the argument breaks through.

   <p>The book is not just about imperialism and colonialism. Edward Said is
   getting at something far deeper, with a much longer history. It is
   about the very foundation stones of western civilisation itself.

   <p>In Orientalism there is a description of Napoleon invading Egypt at
   the end of the 18th century and the building of the Suez Canal, later,
   in the 19th century: 'What more than anything impressed the first Arab
   chronicler of the expeditions, Abd-al-Rahman al-Jabarti, was
   Napoleon's use of scholars to manage his contacts with the natives.'

   <p>Napoleon had brought with him virtually an entire French university.
   Its scholars already had knowledge of Egypt, that is, of its classical
   past. They understood that European civilisation had roots in this
   part of the world. Its occupation of the territory helped lay claim to
   those roots. The thinking was this: the natives have missed out on
   their own history. Never mind. An additional advantage of the
   occupation is that the natives can now be educated about their own
   past.

   <p>This might have been more convincing if the great archaeological finds
   that the Europeans then began excavating had ended up in Cairo's
   museums rather than those of London and Paris, or if the 'natives'
   were, in any sense, to be treated as equal partners in the rediscovery
   of the past. But this was not the intention.

   <p>'Because Egypt was saturated with meaning for the arts, sciences and
   government, its role was to be the stage on which actions of world
   historical importance would take place. By taking Egypt, then, a
   modern power would naturally demonstrate its strength and justify
   history; Egypt's own destiny was to be annexed.'

   <p>The real significance of Europe's intervention in Egypt would become
   blindingly obvious later in the following century with the digging of
   the Suez Canal. As a Thomas Cook brochure helpfully pointed out (yes,
   it's the ancestor of our own T Cook--the travel industry was one of
   the great entrepreneurial initiatives of the day) the Pharaohs had
   begun a canal project. So once again Europe was simply recalling the
   glories of the ancient bygone age on behalf of the natives. Or was it
   really another European crusade with modern technology?

    <h>Civilisation

   <p>'The whole world seemed crowded in to render homage to a scheme that
   God could only bless and make use of himself. Old distinctions and
   inhibitions were dissolved: the Cross faced down the Crescent, the
   West had come to the Orient never to leave...'

   <p>Except of course, as Orientalism points out, when Nasser, Egypt's
   first genuinely independent nationalist ruler, had the effrontery to
   take over the canal in 1956. Then all the foul racism locked into
   western civilisation came hurtling to the surface. Islam had posed a
   major problem for the western civilising mission. The French and the
   British had been ready to celebrate every earlier glory, but about
   this one, they were silent. Not that the western scholars were
   ignorant. They knew that Islam had carried the torch of civilisation
   after the fall of Rome 1,400 yeas ago. Orientalism reports on Gibbon
   in his classic history, Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,
   marvelling at the speed at which the Islamic revolution had finished
   off the Roman Empire. But to remind themselves, and the natives, of
   Islam's former glory would be to undermine the whole project. This was
   western civilisation rediscovering its roots to enforce its power and
   authority in the emerging modern world. There was no way it was going
   to recognise an eastern civilisation equally.

   <p>'Islam was a provocation in many ways. It lay uneasily close to
   Christianity, geographically and culturally. It drew on the
   Judao-Hellenic traditions. It borrowed creatively from
   Christianity--it could boast unrivalled military and political
   successes. Nor was this all. The Islamic lands sit adjacent to and
   even on top of the biblical lands. Moreover, the heart of the Islamic
   domain has always been the region closest to Europe...Arabic and
   Hebrew are Semitic languages, and together they dispose and redispose
   of material that is urgently important to Christianity. From the end
   of the 7th century to the 16th century, Islam in either its Arab,
   Ottoman, North African or Spanish form dominated or effectively
   threatened European Christianity. That Islam outstripped and outshone
   Rome cannot have been absent from the mind of any European.'

   <p>Islam had to be marginalised. The 'western' in western civilisation
   takes its debut, at least in part, from this ousting of Islam. Was
   this not what the Crusades had been about, 1,000 years ago? Less well
   known is the way one of the greatest artistic leaders of the European
   Renaissance, Dante in Florence, humiliates the memory of Islam's
   founder Mohammed.

   <p>In Dante's Inferno, the eternal punishment inflicted upon Mohammed for
   being an 'imposter' is, as Edward Said says, a 'peculiarly disgusting
   one', the detail of which the reader here will be spared. Dante wished
   to characterise the 'Orient as alien...and incorporate it on to the
   theatrical stage...for Europe'. Islam is turned into the outsider
   against which 'the whole of European civilisation from the Middle Ages
   on is founded'.

   <p>Palestine's most accomplished and brilliant spokesperson, then, should
   also be remembered for his exposure of the roots of the west's
   Islamophobia. The worldwide anti-war movement that has begun to forge
   an extraordinary coalition between Muslims and the reviving secular
   left is itself an unintended tribute to him. The Palestinian flag
   helps bind together this unlikely coalition. Edward Said knew more
   than anyone else that the Palestinians could not defeat Zionism and
   its US backers by themselves. The more that the global anti-war
   movement rallies to Palestine, the greater the prospect of unleashing
   the wider forces necessary to bring Zionism crashing down.
