<h>OUR CHANGING CONTINENT

  <h>By John S. Schlee

    <p>Where were the land areas and oceans of the North American
   Continent 1 million years ago, compared to their present locations?
   Was North America always about the same size and shape that it is
   today?

   <p>To answer these questions, geologists construct maps of the lands and
   seas as they existed in past ages. This process of reconstructing
   ancient geography is called paleogeography (from the Greek word
   "palaios," meaning ancient).

  <h>Clues to the Past

   <p>Like a modern-day sleuth, geologists must interpret the clues they
   find preserved in the rocks. These clues are of two main kinds: the
   types of fossils contained in the rocks and the properties of the
   rocks themselves. When interpreted, these clues can give not only
   direct knowledge about the distribution of the lands and the seas, but
   also about the natural environment of the area, such as the climate,
   the temperature and salinity of the water, and the downhill direction
   of slopes on the Earth's surface. The last item is very important if
   we are to infer where the mountains and basins were located in the
   geologic past.

    <h>Fossils as clues

   <p>The distribution of fossils (skeletons, shells, leaf impressions,
   footprints, and dinosaur eggs) in rocks of a certain age tells
   something about the ancient distribution of lands and seas on the
   Earth's surface. The remains of coral and clamshells found in the very
   old limestones in parts of Pennsylvania and New York indicate that
   this region was once covered by a shallow sea. Similarly, the remains
   of ancestral horses and camels in rocks of South Dakota show that the
   area was then dry land or that land was nearby.

   <p>A closer look at these fossils will tell even more. Their distribution
   identifies the ancient areas of land and sea, and also determines the
   approximate shoreline. The distribution of living forms shows that
   thick-shelled fossil animals once lived in shallow water close to
   shore, where their shells were built to withstand the surging and
   pounding of waves. Thin-shelled, delicate fossil animals probably
   lived in deeper, calmer water offshore.

   <p>In addition to providing a measure of water depth, fossils can also be
   used to indicate the former temperature of water. In order to survive,
   certain types of present-day coral must live in warm and shallow
   tropical saltwaters, such as in the seas around Florida and the
   Bahamas. When similar types of coral are found in the ancient
   limestones, they provide a good estimate of the marine environment
   that must have existed when they were alive.

   <p>All these factors -- depth, temperature, currents, and salinity --
   that are revealed by fossils are important, for each detail tends to
   sharpen and clarify the picture of ancient geography.

    <h>Rocks as clues

   <p>The properties of the rocks are also important clues and are used as
   guides in reconstructing paleogeography. A few examples will show some
   of the properties of rocks that are used to decipher the past.

   <p>Before the 1830's, geologists were uncertain about the origin of
   deposits of boulders crudely mixed with sand, silt, and clay which
   cover large portions of Europe and North America. Associated with
   these deposits were large, striated boulders (some as large as a
   house) and scratched and grooved bedrock surfaces. Some naturalists
   had speculated that these deposits originated from debris laid down
   during the Biblical Flood, whereas others suggested that they were
   caused by sediment from melting icebergs.

   <p>In 1836 the famous naturalist Louis Agassiz spent a summer in the
   Swiss Alps, where he had an opportunity to examine the glaciers and
   glacial deposits of the area. From his observations, Agassiz concluded
   that this blanket of boulders, sand, and clay had been spread across
   much of Europe by large continental glaciers during a prehistoric Ice
   Age.

   <p>Much of what Agassiz saw could be explained only by glacial action.
   Because a glacier is a solid mass of ice, it moves very slowly, and as
   it moves, it picks up all sizes of debris, ranging from huge boulders
   to fine silts and clays. As the ice melts, all the debris is left
   behind as a layer of poorly sorted material.

   <p>From the nature and distribution of glacial deposits, geologists have
   formed a picture of what the Earth looked like during a glacial event.

   <p>In the same manner, geologists have recognized rocks that were once
   ancient beach deposits because most beaches are composed of
   well-sorted sand. The action of waves along the shores of ancient seas
   washed out the silt and clay and left behind rounded grains of sand,
   just as those along present shorelines. Offshore, where the bottom
   waters are calmer, the finer sediment settles as mud. In a general
   way, the size of the sediment grains shows the direction of slope on
   the sea floor, because the sandy sediment will be near the shore and
   the mud will be offshore. This same principle of sorting also applies
   to ancient rocks; marine sandstones and conglomerates were formed
   closer to shore than were the finer textured marine shales and
   siltstones.

   <p>The same concept of sorting can be used with nonmarine formations,
   such as river and delta deposits , to determine the direction of
   paleoslope (ancient slope). Rivers (like waves) sort the rock debris,
   leaving the coarser materials near the head of the stream and carrying
   the finer materials downstream toward the coast.

   <p>To provide additional information on the direction of flow of ancient
   streams, geologists study the arrangement of the layers in stream
   deposits. A close look at many sandstones, for example, shows inclined
   layers of sand, called cross beds. By determining the direction in
   which the cross beds are inclined, geologists can tell the direction
   in which water flowed when the sand grains were deposited. Even today,
   sands are forming cross beds, particularly in river channels and in
   shoal areas where ripplelike dunes form across the channel. Like dunes
   in a desert, these dunes slowly move in a downstream direction. The
   current carries the sand grains up the gently inclined upstream side
   of the dunes and deposits them on the steeper sloping downstream side.
   The inclined layers of sand are deposited on the front of the dune,
   producing beds with a downstream (downcurrent) dip. Dip measurements
   from a great many cross beds in rocks of the same age that are exposed
   over a wide area show a useful pattern of ancient flow direction
   (paleocurrent). Both sorting and layering of sediments in river
   deposits are used to determine the location of ancient highlands and
   lowlands.

    <h>Maps as pictures

   <p>To obtain a picture of ancient geography as it existed during a
   particular interval of geologic time, geologists plot the distribution
   of various kinds of rocks for a given geologic age on a map. Then, by
   noting the location of the delta deposits, the beach deposits, and the
   stream deposits, geologists can determine the approximate location of
   an ancient shoreline that separated land from sea.

   <p>Fossils, the size and sorting of grains, and the direction of cross
   beds in rocks are only a few of many such clues, although they are the
   most useful, that geologists use to reconstruct paleogeography. By
   using these data, geologists reconstruct pictures of the geography of
   the North American Continent during each of the various periods of
   geologic time, such as the Great Ice Age (Pleistocene Epoch), the Age
   of Dinosaurs (Cretaceous Period), and the Coal Age (Pennsylvanian
   Period).

  <h>The Great Ice Age

   Pleistocene time.
       During the Great Ice Age, or Pleistocene Epoch, which began about
   2 million years ago, large portions of Canada and the Northern United
   States were blanketed by the continental ice sheet, as shown on the
   map. Much of the rich soil of the Midwest is glacial in origin, and
   the drainage patterns of the Ohio River and the position of the Great
   Lakes were influenced by the ice. The effects of the glaciers can be
   seen in the stony soil of some areas, the hilly land surfaces dotted
   with lakes, the scratched and grooved bedrock surfaces, and the long,
   low ridges composed of sand and gravel which formed at the front of
   the ice sheet.

   <p>Increased rainfall in the area south of the continental ice sheet
   formed large lakes in Utah, Nevada, and California. Remnants of these
   ancient lakes still exist today as the Great Salt Lake, Pyramid Lake,
   Winnemucca, and many others. Ancient shorelines for these old lakes
   can be found along the sides of mountains, as for example, near Provo,
   Utah.

   <p>The tremendous size of the ice sheet further influenced paleogeography
   by lowering sea level about 450 feet below the present level; the
   water contained in the ice and snow came from the oceans. The
   continental shelves around our continent, as well as the other
   continents of the world, were above water and, as a result, some
   States such as Florida were much larger than they are today. The
   shoreline deposits and shells at the edge of the Continental Shelf, in
   waters to 450 feet deep, are evidence of this marked drop in sea level
   during the Pleistocene.

  <h>The Age of Dinosaurs

   <p>Eighty million years ago, during the Age of Dinosaurs, the geography
   of North America was very different from that of today. Mountain
   ranges have changed considerably since this, the Cretaceous Period.
   The Appalachian Mountains were probably lower and less conspicuous as
   a source of sediment than they are today; apparently they supplied
   appreciable amounts of coarse sediment only in the Southeast
   (Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, and Georgia). The Rocky Mountains,
   as they are today, did not exist; instead a giant trough in which
   marine sediment slowly accumulated occupied this part of the West.
   Shallow, warm inland seas covered large portions of the Southern and
   Western United States, as shown on the map. Large portions of
   California were under water, and in eastern California, Nevada,
   Arizona, Idaho, eastern Oregon, Washington, and Alberta, a belt of the
   Earth's crust slowly rose to form a new mountain range. Details from
   this vast highland extended eastward into Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, and
   New Mexico. Still farther east, Kansas, Nebraska, and adjacent States
   to the north and south were covered by warm, extensive, but shallow
   seas in which beds of limestone slowly formed.

                                   time.

   <p>The Cretaceous Period marked the last extensive covering of the North
   American continent by the sea. Since then, sea level has dropped and
   the continent has gradually emerged to its present size and shape.

  <h>The Coal Age

   <p>As we move backward in time from the Great Ice Age, to the Age of
   Dinosaurs, and then to the Coal Age, the contrast in the distribution
   of land and water from the ancient past to the present becomes more
   dramatic. The map shows the outline of the United States as it looked
   during the Pennsylvanian Period some 300 million years ago. It gives
   the appearance of reversing present-day geography.

   <h>Generalized geographic map of the United States in Middle
   Pennsylvanian time.

   <p>A highland which lay to the east, south, and north supplied much of
   the sedimentary debris that was spread over the midwestern part of the
   United States. The Midwest was mainly a low swampy area in which
   scouring rushes and fern trees grew in profusion. Sediment was carried
   into the region from deltas to the east. From time to time, the level
   of the sea fluctuated -- possibly because of glacial conditions in the
   Southern Hemisphere. Swamps were flooded, and forests were destroyed.
   Slowly, layers rich in tree stumps, spores, branches, and leaves were
   deposited. Later, heat and pressure changed these layers into the coal
   beds that are so extensive in Illinois, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, West
   Virginia, and Tennessee. To the west, marine limestones, sandstones,
   and shales accumulated in shallow seas whose vast expanses were dotted
   with shoals and islands. Some of the very large islands were formed by
   the buckling and uplifting of parts of the Earth's crust.

   <p>The maps depicting the Pleistocene Epoch and the Cretaceous and
   Pennsylvanian Periods give a simplified picture of the changes in the
   size and shape of the continent. Examinations of older and older rocks
   show that in the earlier periods, the land areas of the North American
   Continent were much smaller and were largely confined to central and
   northern Canada. In fact, during much of geologic time, large parts of
   the continental United States were covered by shallow seas in which
   lime, mud, and sand accumulated.

   <p>The maps show that the mountain ranges have buckled the Earth's crust
   from time to time. Most of these ranges were located along the eastern
   and western margins of the present continent, and erosion of newly
   formed highlands contributed sediment toward the center of the
   continent. Eventually, these ranges were worn down (as in the
   Appalachian region during the Cretaceous Period). The process of
   mountain building continued, however, either by renewed uplift and
   erosion of old mountain ranges such as in the Appalachians, or by
   building new and youthful mountains such as those that make up the
   Coast Range of California.

   <p>The appearance of our continent has been continuously changed by this
   complicated sequence of mountain building, erosion, and deposition of
   sediment in slowly sinking troughs, followed by more crustal movement.

   <p>These changes are still going on today, although they are so gradual
   that only occasionally do we become aware of them. One dramatic effect
   of change is the jolting movement of a portion of the Earth's crust
   during an earthquake. Another is the fire and devastation associated
   with the building of a volcano during eruptions, like that of Mount
   St. Helens in 1980. Such spectacular actions by nature in building
   continents are combined with the less noticeable processes of erosion
   and deposition that have gradually shaped and changed the face of the
   North American Continent and the entire planet throughout geologic
   time.

   <h>In the early stages of the development of the U.S.
   Atlantic continental margin, North America moved away from Africa,
   Europe, and South America.

   <p>Not only has the geography of continents changed slowly over
   milleniums but so has their position. About 200 million years ago, a
   supercontinent (called Pangea) linked North and South America, Africa,
   and Europe. One of the exciting new advances in geology since the
   early 1960's has been the realization that the continents and
   substantial parts of the bordering ocean floor have slowly movedwith
   respect to each other and that the outermost layer of the Earth's
   crust is made up of lithospheric plates. As these thin plates of
   oceanic and continental crust move, they change the positions of the
   continent; the theory that describes their formation, movement, and
   destruction is called plate tectonics.

   <p>Scientists of the U.S. Geological Survey, together with all geologists
   working in the many fields of research, continually add to the fund of
   information about the Earth -- its origins, its mineral resources, and
   the processes that change its crustal features. Studies of the
   physical and chemical properties of rocks are coupled with studies of
   the development of life in its myriad forms to provide the data which,
   when fitted together, lead to a better understanding of the successive
   changes that have occurred on the Earth. These concepts, like the maps
   shown in this leaflet, are "incomplete" because much information has
   yet to be discovered. But as geologists' knowledge of the Earth
   increases, the record of its history has become clearer and more
   meaningful.
