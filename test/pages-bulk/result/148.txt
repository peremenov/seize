<h>CBS Chief's Hooker Stalker

   <p>CBS was clearly looking for a fresh start when it replaced
   theMemogate-tainted Andrew Heyward with SeanMcManus as president of
   its news division. But unfortunately theappointment seems to have
   brought McManus a tawdry blast from his own past. Wehear a mentally
   unstable former bra model who once had a one-night encounterwith
   McManus--and whom the exec had arrested after she threatened to
   tellthe press--recently went on a rampage after hearing about
   hispromotion.

   <p>The sordid affair began when McManus, at the time V.P. for CBS Sports,
   wentto an Upper East Side bar on the night of the 1997 U.S. Open and
   metCharlotte von Vogt, a then 46-year-old part-time prostitute
   andformer bra model once known for having "the most beautiful breasts
   in theworld"--at least according to famed flack Dick Falk.The exec
   reportedly enjoyed a few rounds of cocktails with the buxom blonde,
   then invited her back to his Park Avenue apartment for a nightcap.

   <p>It was at this point that their memories of the evening diverge. Von
   Vogt hasclaimed that she and McManus embarked on a night of drinking,
   drug use, andkinky sex. In court, an attorney for McManus categorized
   the whole encountersimply as "a chat, a walk, a drink, [and] a simple
   and chastegoodbye." The one thing that's certain is that after the two
   parted,von Vogt began to call McManus nonstop, demanding that he
   acknowledge what sheclaims transpired between them and pleading with
   him to attend a session withher psychiatrist. When she finally
   threatened him in February1998--after 15 fruitless calls, many of
   which McManus secretlyrecorded--that she would go public with her
   story if he persisted indenying what ocurred, he had her arrested for
   harassment and"telephone stalking." (McManus, incidentally, had just
   gottenmarried the previous June.)

   <p>When the case went to court in 1999, McManus was cross-examined twice
   aboutthe evening in front of a press-filled gallery. (So much for
   keeping it out ofthe papers.) Von Vogt, however, suffered a nervous
   breakdown during theproceedings--brought on, she claimed, by the
   investigatorsCBS had sicced on her--and the judge declared her unfit
   for trial.Afterwards, her attorney, David Breitbart, suggested shesee
   a new therapist to deal with the emotional fallout from the case.

   <p>According to a source close to the trial, von Vogt only saw the
   therapistbriefly before dropping out of sight--until October of this
   year, whenMcManus was announced as the incoming CBS News head. We're
   told she began calling the female shrink nonstop, venting her anger
   over the exec's promotion and claiming "she was going to use [the
   psychiatrist] to get toMcManus." Then, last Halloween, von Vogt
   followed the shrink fromher office and attempted to push her into
   oncoming traffic on York Avenue and75th Street in Manhattan,
   screaming, "You Bitch! You piece of garbage! You'rejust a pawn to get
   to McManus!" She was arrested and, last we heard, was beingheld
   without bail.

<h>PETA Sends Vogue Holiday Jeer

   <p>Anna Wintour can't catch a break. Just two days after PETA plastered
   bathrooms at the Vogue editor's favorite haunts with stickers calling
   her a "fur hag," we hear the animal rights faction is planning an
   all-out assault on her staff--with Christmas cards.

   <p>According to PETA spokesman Michael McGraw, the anti-fur outfit is
   planning to mail festive green-and-red envelopes to the glossy's staff
   containing illustrated peek-a-boo cards that open to reveal an
   emaciated Wintour in her underwear. A message scrawled on the front
   and inside reads: "Without Fur I Am Nothing." (Fashionistas may recall
   similar cards being handed out during New York Fashion Week in 2000.)

   <p>"We have a mailing list for the entire staff of Vogue, and they'll be
   going out this week to everyone," McGraw said. Asked how PETA had
   obtained the list, the rep first cracked, "That's proprietary
   information," before saying, somewhat ominously, "Not everyone on
   Anna's staff shares her fetish for fur." (Of course, they could have
   just looked at the masthead.)

   <p>Why is PETA so stuck on Wintour?

   <p>"We've been trying to work with the magazine since the early nineties,
   but they have repeatedly turned down paid PETA anti-fur ads
   sight-unseen," the spokesman said, adding that advertisements
   featuring "some of the biggest names in Hollywood" like Charlize
   Theron, Kim Basinger, and Pamela Anderson have run in other fashion
   mags. "We simply ask for equal time. If they're going to promote fur
   through dozens and dozens of editorial and advertising pages each
   month, at least let us pay for an anti-fur ad."

   <p>While Wintour shows no signs of bending to her blood-tossing bêtes
   noires, McGraw says the group "remains hopeful that Anna will have a
   change of heart." After all, Martha Stewart, who was at the top of
   PETA's "worst-dressed list" last year, has since "learned about the
   cruelty involved and actually narrated an anti-fur video for us," he
   said.

   <p>If Wintour fails to follow Martha's lead, what kind of greeting can
   she expect for the next Hallmark holiday? "We have no plans yet for
   Easter," McGraw said, "though Valentine's Day may see some PETA cupids
   outside Condé Nast."

   <p>A Vogue rep could not be reached by press time.

<h>No Happy Ending For Jenna Bush

   <p>Jenna Bush's infamous ID-gate videotape is raising more questions than
   the Zapruder film. According to a source who has seen the
   footage--which features a self-described downtown coke dealer relating
   his late-night run-in with the First Daughter, and brandishing her
   college ID as a souvenir--the man insinuates that the two shared more
   than just drinks.

   <p>A well-informed source, who has a DVD copy of the interview shot by
   tbirdshow.com's Travis Poston, says that at one point the dealer
   claims that the young, blonde Jenna Bush with the Texas accent he hung
   out with that night (and who happened to leave behind Jenna Bush's
   belongings) had been "helping [him] clean up" the bar after a long
   night of partying.

   <p>(A publicist for First Lady Laura Bush has unequivocally denied that
   her daughter has ever been to the Chinatown bar, Happy Ending, even
   though we hear the UT-Austin ID card displayed in the film clearly
   shows the hard-partying political liability's name, picture and
   student ID number.)

   <p>According to the New York Post's Page Six, the Secret Service are
   reportedly taking the tape seriously enough to investigate, and we
   hear they're not the only ones. When Fresh Intelligence emailed
   tbirdshow.com about securing selected clips to host on this site, we
   received the following curt response: "There are about ten top papers
   fighting for that footage. Get in line."

   <p>Needless to say, "if a coke dealer has your ID it doesn't look so
   good," quipped the source.

   <p>Apparently, the affable salesman doesn't limit his company to
   presidential offspring. "He brags on camera that he's down with all
   the members of Interpol," our source says. "And everybody in the club
   that walks by in the video says `hi' to him."

   <p>Reps for Bush and Interpol could not be reached by press time.

<h>Star Search At AMI

  <p>What happens when tabloid editors stop fabricating celebrity
   pregnancies and start getting real? Insiders at David Pecker's
   checkout-aisle empire say execs there have been working with a
   Hollywood producer to create a reality TV series chronicling the
   professional--and personal--lives of AMI staffers.

   <p>According to a source involved in the talks, a hand-picked group of
   employees was summoned to a video conference last Wednesday to learn
   what would be expected of them if the show gets greenlit. The producer
   will begin interviewing candidates this week in search of eight
   staffers worthy of being tailed by round-the-clock camera crews, we
   hear.

   <p>"Star, Celebrity Living, Men's Fitness, Shape--we had people from
   everywhere," the source said when asked about the cattle call. "We're
   having meetings, but there's no pen to paper yet. We haven't made a
   commitment but we're exploring it." The only thing certain, the source
   added, is that the proposed series won't prominently feature Pecker or
   editorial director Bonnie Fuller.

   <p>Tentatively called One Park Avenue after the company's Manhattan
   address ("We don't own the rights to that title yet," the source
   noted, saying the producer would have to license them from the
   building), the show will be "about the lives of the people who work
   here versus just about the magazines."

   <p>According to multiple AMI sources, those willing to sacrifice their
   remaining shreds of dignity to the company's multimedia ambitions will
   indeed be paid.

   <p>"We get pitches all the time from people, and this is just one of
   many," the source said. "I'm sure if you call any magazine company,
   everyone is looking to get their name on TV. I mean, Glamor, Vogue, Us
   Weekly, Rolling Stone, Seventeen--they're all looking for
   opportunities to get on TV."

   <p>The source declined to name the producer who pitched the series,
   saying only that he was "pretty well-established" in the genre.
   According to AMI insiders, the mystery producer has worked on both
   Extreme Makeover: Home Edition and Showtime's Penn & Teller: Bullshit!
   The only producer fitting that description, according to IMDB, is
   reality TV vet Star Price whose spine-tingling credits like The
   Scariest Places on Earth and the upcoming Nightmare on Elm Street:
   Real Nightmares would seem to make him a perfect fit for capturing
   life in Bonnie-ville. (Price did not return calls for comment.)

   <p>Of course, some might ask whether it's a good time to expose the
   privately held company's inner workings to the public. AMI's
   diminishing earnings and high staff turnover have lately been a
   recurring theme in New York Post media scribbler Keith Kelly 's
   column, which recently announced the hiring of Carlos Abaunza, AMI's
   third CFO in 2005 alone.

   <p>This isn't the first time Fuller and Co. have tried to bring life at a
   celeb weekly to the small screen. In 2003, when she was still at Us
   Weekly, a series reportedly nicknamed "The Bonnie Show" fell through
   because "it imposed on the real job of putting out a magazine every
   week--it encumbered the process." The source claimed that One Park
   Avenue would be "totally different."

   <p>"The Us Weekly show was about how a magazine gets put together in the
   newsroom and all that shit," the source said. "This concept has
   nothing to do with that."

   <p>An AMI rep did not wish to be quoted on the record for this story.

<h>Tom Ford's Indecent Proposal

   <p>We hear flesh-obsessed designer Tom Ford's gig as guest editor of
   Vanity Fair's Hollywood Issue recently hit a kink. Sources close to
   the glossy say demure rising starlet Rachel McAdams stormed out of a
   November cover shoot for the annual industry mash note--and fired her
   publicist--after learning Ford expected her to pose nude.

   <p>According to mag insiders, Ford had prearranged with McAdam's rep,
   Wolf Kasteller's Ame Van Iden, for the in-demand Red Eye actress to
   appear naked in a group portrait of Hollywood's breathtaking
   beauties-of-the-moment, alongside Keira Knightley, Scarlett Johansson,
   and others. (We presume the shoot was conceived along the tasteful
   lines of Herb Ritts' iconic 1989 supermodel ensemble, "Stephanie Cindy
   Christy Tatjana Naomi", but considering Ford's involvement it's
   possible to imagine a raunchier scenario.)

   <p>Unfortunately for legions of mouth-breathing McAdams fans, we're told
   Van Iden neglected to brief her family-friendly charge--who may have
   been the only actress in Wedding Crashers to keep all her clothes
   on--about the concept beforehand. When she arrived on the L.A. set and
   found out what Ford had in mind, we're told she turned tail and
   promptly fired Van Iden.

   <p>"Every magazine wants her on their cover and thinks she's gonna be
   huge, so she can get away with being picky," says a Condé Nast
   insider. "But everyone's really impressed that she stood up for
   herself. It's kind of amazing, actually."

   <p>While the 29-year-old actress's chaste retreat suggests she has a tad
   more dignity than the average Hollywood climber, it's odd she was so
   blindsided by Ford's request. After all, the former Gucci designer has
   previously told reporters the "entire issue would be naked," and his
   recent work has certainly showcased his fondness for letting it all
   hang out--he posed au naturel for a 22-page spread in last month's W,
   his new line of cosmetics for Estee Lauder is called Amber Nude, his
   ad campaign for the fragrance Youth Dew features a naked Carolyn
   Murphy, and an advertisement he produced for a new line of sunglasses
   reportedly features porn stars whom he says were paid "to have sex on
   set."

   <p>Neither Ford nor VF spokeswoman Beth Kseniak returned calls about the
   incident. McAdam's manager, Shelley Browning, confirmed that McAdams
   "presently does not have a publicist," but referred questions about
   the cover shoot to the magazine. Van Iden herself did not return
   calls.

   <p>UPDATE: So much for dignity. Even though McAdams fired her publicist
   for neglecting to tell her she was expected to pose nude, we hearshe
   ultimately decided a VF cover was toogood to pass up and returned to
   disrobe anyway. We also hear Van Iden, herfired rep,wasn't even on set
   when it happened. A top-tier Hollywood playerwritesin:

   <p>"Ame was absolutely set up by Vanity Fair. No one talkedtoher
   beforehand about her client posing nude. (Seriously--if they
   had,shewould never have agreed to it). Ame had to cover another
   client'sshoot inL.A. and sent her counterpart from Wolf Kasteller's
   New York office toaccompany Rachel on the set. When they arrived, [VF
   celebritywrangler]Jane Sarkin told Rachel, `Oh, Ame knew all about
   thisandagreed to it,' which was an out and out lie and, moreover, a
   way tointimidate a young actress into taking her clothes off. Of
   course, theyalwaysblame the publicist, and sweet, mild-mannered Ame
   got fired by her clientforit. Very low-end, nasty stuff if you ask
   me."

<h>Is Singer's Superman A Loss For Lois?

   <p>Did director Bryan Singer's penchant for casting with the lensman in
   his pants influence his choice of Brandon Routh to play the Man of
   Steel in Superman Returns? Ever since the unknown 26-year-old
   actor--whose career highlights consist of a season on One Life to Live
   and an episode of Will & Grace --landed the part over Warner Brothers'
   reported favorite Jim Caviezel, fanboy bloggers have been wondering
   whether the famously beefcake-friendly filmmaker's decision had more
   to do with his libido than his director's eye.

   <p>Of course, if Singer cast an object of his desire in a role, it
   wouldn't be the first time. According to Alex Burton, the unknown who
   played Pyro in Singer's first X-Men blockbuster, he was given the part
   after a hot-tub session with the director at a Hollywood party. "Bryan
   created that role especially for me," says Burton, who went on to act
   in exactly zero films post-X-Men.

   <p>(Singer, it seems, has a thing for water. Following the filming of Apt
   Pupil, a number of young male extras on the movie filed lawsuits
   claiming that they had been bullied into stripping naked for a shower
   scene and that Singer had held private screenings of the wet `n' wild
   footage at his home. The suits never reached court.)

   <p>Whether or not Routh ("rhymes with mouth," according to Newsweek;
   "B.J." to his friends, according to IMDB) knows his way around a
   loofah, early press on the film has only fanned the proverbial flames.
   As Superman Returns actress Parker Posey told Newsweek (albeit,
   completely out of context), "Poor Brandon. He's got everyone touching
   him all the time. He's lying on his stomach and he's got five people
   coming up and pulling his underwear down, sticking their hands up the
   butt of his suit. I can't imagine what it's like." (The article goes
   on to say that "the biggest issue for the studio" was what size to
   make Superman's "package.")

   <p>Further driving chatter on online message boards is the out director's
   track record of putting together gay-friendly productions. Kevin
   Spacey, who has long ducked questions about his sexuality, was the
   centerpiece of Singer's breakout film The Usual Suspects (he also
   appears in Superman Returns, as Lex Luthor), and the director's two
   X-Men movies--about teen superheroes fighting for acceptance (and
   starring Hugh Jackman, Alan Cumming and Sir Ian McKellan)--were widely
   interpreted as allegories for coming out of the closet. In fact, one
   particularly out-there bit of gossip making the rounds is that Singer
   cast Routh specifically because he wanted a closeted actor who could
   "come out" as a political statement-cum-publicity-stunt in the run-up
   to the movie's June `06 premiere.

   <p>Asked about Routh's path to the silver screen, his publicist at PMK,
   Simon Halls, said that while he rarely comments on his clients'
   personal lives, "I think it only fair to tell you that Brandon is
   happily involved with his longtime girlfriend, and any claims to the
   contrary are just plain silliness." A rep for Singer did not respond
   to calls or detailed e-mails seeking comment.

<h>Page Six Cuts And Runs

   <p>In the course of writing this column, we receive our fare share of
   verbose legal threats and understand how annoying it can be to deal
   with the petulant demands of high-powered attorneys. That said, we're
   a bit disappointed to see our good pals at Page Six not only cave
   under pressure, but pass the buck on to us for their own erroneous
   reporting. In a retraction published yesterday, the usually on-target
   scandal sheet apologized profusely for picking up our scoop on
   Brittany Murphy's untimely split from both her publicist and manager,
   and parroted her flack's line that the moves were Murphy's decision.

   <p>Fair enough. There's a reason Marty Singer is the best-paid lawyer in
   Hollywood. Decidedly un-kosher, however, is the assertion that we
   attributed the split to a certain declasse episode at a Hollywood
   party. We didn't. The drug and
   caiter-waiter-banging-bonanza-of-a-blind item in question appeared in
   Ted Casablancas's column on E! Online and was subsequently dissected
   by the readers of Defamer. Although we did link to the item and the
   Defamer post, we never claimed the anonymous skank was Murphy; only
   that it didn't reflect well on her image that a large number of her
   fans seemed to think it was. In Page Six's defense, when they get
   something wrong--as they reliably do with our site address--at least
   they're consistent.

<h>Braunstein Victim Calls in Cavalry

   <p>While New York's finest chase reporter-turned-"Fire Fiend" Peter
   Braunstein from strip club to strip club across the Midwest, we hear
   the depraved journo's victim has been trying to wrest herself free
   from the latest crime story to grip the local tabs. Sources say a
   number of the city's news outlets have recently received legal letters
   from Lynda Goldman, a high-powered attorney--and partner at pitbull
   entertainment lawyer Marty Singer's firm, no less--whom the former W
   mag staffer has hired to keep her personal details out of the press.

   <p>Though Goldman would not specify which publications have been
   contacted, she confirmed that she was retained "to encourage the media
   to behave in a responsible manner so that this victim isn't victimized
   further." The former W staffer--whose identity, while known in media
   circles, has been kept out of print--has been keeping a low profile
   since the Halloween attack, when Braunstein, a onetime co-worker at
   the fashion glossy, reportedly gained access to her Chelsea apartment
   by masquerading as a fireman, knocked her out with chloroform, and
   tied her to a chair before sexually molesting her for 12 hours.

   <p>"I've been dealing with some issues because we're very concerned about
   her privacy while this guy is still at large," said Goldman. "It's
   obviously very disturbing that he's still out there and that he's
   evaded the authorities for all this time, so any kind of identifying
   information that could lead him or other people to locate her is a
   major invasion of privacy that could put her life in jeopardy."

   <p>Among the published details she finds particularly worrisome are where
   the victim works, where she lives, and even the name of her next-door
   neighbor, the attorney said. "And that's not an inclusive list," she
   added.

   <p>While some have speculated that the victim hired a lawyer to keep her
   own identity under wraps until she is prepared to go public in some
   remunerative fashion, Goldman insists that's not the case. "I wasn't
   retained because she's working on a book or movie or any nonsense like
   that," she said. "I was retained because she was concerned, as anyone
   would be in her circumstance, about her privacy and her safety." She
   added, however, that her client might be interested in telling her
   side of the story "somewhere down the road when this guy is
   incarcerated."

   <p>Goldman--who explained she was chosen to represent her client because
   the two women "share a mutual friend"--said although she herself
   relies on newspaper reports for developments in the case, she is
   frustrated by how much info the media-savvy Braunstein might be
   gleaning from the coverage.

   <p>"Some of the reporting I've seen just seems to me incredibly
   irresponsible," she said. "If I'm reading a report in the press of
   somebody saying, `We just saw him at x location going to all these
   strip clubs,' don't you think that he reads the papers and says, `Oh,
   guess I better not go to any more strip clubs?'" Asked whether she had
   considered the possibility that police had planted those stories to
   flush Braunstein out, Goldman admitted, "I don't know what law
   enforcement does during these situations, but as a citizen reading
   this stuff, it just strikes me as foolish."

<h>Regan Flack Fights Back

   <p>Publishing seductress Judith Regan has gotten away with her vindictive
   tantrums in the past, but sources say she may have chosen the wrong
   foe in her former PR director, Paul Crichton. Friends of the
   well-liked publicist say he hired an attorney to look into a possible
   libel suit after Regan dispatched a minion to smear him in the New
   York Post.

   <p>"Paul's lawyer and his friends are all urging him to sue Regan and
   [Regan Books parent company] HarperCollins for defamation of
   character, slander, libel, whatever, for what they said about him in
   the Post," says a source close to Crichton, referring to last
   Wednesday's Page Six item in which Paula Conway--identified as "Regan
   Media's interim PR director"--accused the publicist of clearing his
   desk "at like midnight" and sneaking away after being questioned about
   "unauthorized spending in his department."

   <p>"It was all a lie--he was never under investigation for anything,"
   says the source. (HarperCollins reps declined to comment on a
   departing employee, but a company source confirmed to the New York
   Daily News's Lowdown column that there was never an investigation.)

   <p>Furthermore, a top-level Regan Books employee said she didn't know
   anything about Conway or an "interim PR director." According to our
   source, that's because "Paula is really just a freelance publicist who
   happens to be a close personal friend of Maureen Regan, Judith's
   sister." The two women are also co-authors of a book called The Beauty
   Buyble: The Top 100 Beauty Products of 2006, scheduled to be published
   by Regan's imprint next year.

   <p>The real reason Crichton decided to leave--after shepherding 13 of
   Regan's books onto the New York Times best-seller list--was that his
   boss was working him like a Siberian husky in the Iditarod, says our
   source. We're told that the slight, 32-year-old publicist lost 10
   pounds after taking on the responsibilities of associate publisher and
   director of marketing, in addition to his regular duties, when those
   positions were vacated in July.

   <p>"Paul worked his ass off, but Judith was insisting that he sign a
   three-year contract at the same pay he was receiving before he took on
   the additional jobs and, on top of that, move to L.A.," where Regan
   recently moved her operations, the source says. "When he called her to
   say he wouldn't sign and to give notice, she hung up on him. Anyway,
   you can't blame him for not looking forward to working with Victoria
   Gotti, Janice Dickinson, and Kimora Lee--all of whom have books coming
   out next year."

   <p>But while rumors have been circulating that Crichton may want to vent
   some of his frustrations by writing a tell-all detailing his ex-boss's
   mean streak and infamous private exploits (like her ill-fated affair
   with wannabe Homeland Security czar Bernard Kerik; call it, The Devil
   Wears Nada) the publicist's pal laughs the notion off, saying, "he's
   no Bridie Clark." Another former Regan Books employee, Clark is
   already hard at work on a roman à clef about the company--in which
   staffers are thinly disguised to skirt her confidentiality agreement,
   entitled Because She Can. Besides, Crichton may not have much time for
   writing. We're told he's starting a new job next Monday.

   <p>Crichton himself could not be reached for comment, and calls to a
   Regan Books publicist were not returned by press time.

<h>Locklear and Sambora: Livin' on a Prayer?

   <p>While no one was surprised to learn of Jessica Simpson and Nick
   Lachey's split last week, we hear music biz insiders are buzzing about
   the possible marital troubles of another, less-stage-managed Hollywood
   couple--Heather Locklear and Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora.

   <p>Long admired for sustaining one of the arena-rock world's most stable
   marriages--their eleventh anniversary is later this month--the couple
   recently fell out over Sambora's desire to give their 8-year-old
   daughter, Ava Elizabeth, a sibling, according to a source close to the
   band. We're told the 44-year-old Locklear, who frequently complains
   about movie execs' disdain for aging actresses, thinks a second child
   would hurt her chances at landing the sexy roles she specializes in.

   <p>"She doesn't want another kid because she thinks she's Hollywood
   royalty," says our source. "But Richie is an only child and
   desperately wants another kid."

   <p>Another strain on the couple is the fact that Sambora has just
   embarked on a seven-month, 20-country world tour with Bon Jovi to
   promote their new album Have a Nice Day--and we're told the band is
   doing everything they can to convince him to "dump [Locklear] and move
   on."

   <p>"The members of the band never liked her anyway, particularly Jon [Bon
   Jovi]," says the source. "The band's a bunch of blue-collar stiffs
   from New Jersey who feel that they got lucky. They're regular guys,
   and Heather is spoiled--she still thinks that's she's an ingénue."

   <p>But Sambora isn't the only one looking for a way out, we hear.
   According to our source, Locklear has been "stepping out" on her
   husband.

   <p>One person the Perfect Man actress has been spotted with frequently in
   recent months is her ex-husband, Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee. As the
   New York Post's Page Six reported, Locklear invited the

<h>Ahnold's Foggy Recall in London Libel Case

   <p>Californians may not be happy with the lack of transparency in the
   Governator's office, but none of Arnold Schwarzenegger's political
   dodges quite compare to his slipperiness in dealing with Anna
   Richardson, a British TV personality who is suing him for libel.

   <p>Richardson first became a thorn in Schwarzenegger's beefy flank when
   she was quoted in various news stories--including a landmark Premiere
   magazine article headlined "Arnold the Barbarian"--saying that the
   actor had pulled her onto his lap and pinched her nipple after a
   December 2000 interview for her London-based show Big Screen. When
   Schwarzenegger's team attacked her in an October 2003 Los Angeles
   Times story about the then-candidate's wandering hands--claiming that
   she'd hopped on his lap, seductively cupped her breasts and asked,
   "What do you think of these?"--the 35-year-old vicar's daughter filed
   a libel suit against the governor and two of his associates.

   <p>Since then, we hear, the governor and his lawyer, Marty Singer, have
   tried every lowdown trick in the book to weasel out of the
   lawsuit--even going so far as to refuse to accept the service of legal
   papers for nearly a year, according to a source close to Richardson.
   (We're told Singer only relented after her barrister, Graham Atkins,
   sent him at least three personal letters demanding that he take the
   case seriously.)

   <p>Schwarzenegger has also tried to distance himself from the suit,
   saying Sheryl Main (the Columbia Tristar flack quoted in the L.A.
   Times story, now a member of the governor's communications team) and
   Sean Walsh (a former campaign spokesman, now director of the state
   Office of Planning and Research) were not acting with his knowledge or
   at his behest when they disseminated the slur. Our source says that,
   in papers filed in his defense, the governor has even denied any
   official connection to "Californians for Schwarzenegger," the
   nonprofit reelection committee that is paying the trio's legal fees.
   If that's the case, the governor may want to refresh his memory.
   According to municipal documents, Schwarzenegger owns Main Street
   Plaza, the Santa Monica building that houses the committee's
   headquarters.

   <p>In another curious passage in his defense papers, we're told that
   Schwarzenegger "denies that he has a history of sexual misconduct...
   and the Claimant must prove the grounds on which she alleges that any
   such history is now admitted or well-documented or was at the time of
   his election campaign a matter of public knowledge." While the
   governor may somehow be under the impression that Brits can't read
   American publications, which have obsessively covered Arnold's
   multiple groping allegations, the governor's own admission that "where
   there's smoke, there's fire" and that he's "behaved badly" towards
   women have been trumpeted by a dozen UK papers as well.

   <p>At least Richardson is having it easier than Rhonda Miller. After the
   former stuntwoman announced the day before Schwarzenegger's election
   that he had grabbed her breasts, Walsh told reporters that Miller had
   a history of prostitution and drug abuse. Though the allegations were
   completely untrue, Miller's suit was overturned in court thanks to
   America's defendant-friendly libel laws. (Luckily for Richardson, Brit
   law puts the burden of proof on the defense in such cases.)

   <p>At the end of the day, Schwarzenegger's maneuvers will probably come
   to naught. Ever since a judge declared the governor was "not
   peripheral" to the case, experts have predicted that a settlement is
   the only way for Schwarzenegger to avoid an inconvenient appearance
   before a judge in a powdered wig--probably during his 2006 reelection
   campaign.

   <p>Reached for comment, Singer declined to discuss his defense
   strategy--"I'm not an English attorney, but I've been told that you're
   not supposed to comment on papers filed"--but denied that he or
   Schwarzenegger had resisted being served. "We resisted jurisdiction,"
   Singer said. "That's why the papers weren't accepted, per se. When the
   process server came to the office, it was voluntarily accepted. There
   was no evasion of service." The high-priced attorney did confirm that
   there had been "numerous communications between me and the plaintiff's
   lawyer," but he wouldn't go into detail. As for a settlement, "we
   haven't discussed it," he said, adding, for good measure, "You're a
   tabloid reporter, and these are stupid questions."

   <p>A spokesman for the governor could not be reached by deadline.

<h>Paris Hilton's Ken Doll

   <p>We hear Bob Woodward's not the only respected journalist to have his
   objectivity swayed by access to the high and mighty. Sources at Us
   Weekly say the mag's West Coast editor, Ken Baker, has gotten a little
   too close to Paris Hilton, and that his not-so-secret obsession with
   his number-one source is affecting his coverage.

   <p>According to insiders at the gossip glossy, the 35-year-old Baker
   spends a large part of his day on the phone with Paris, and insists on
   putting a positive spin on anything published about the heiress--much
   to the consternation of his boss, Janice Min. "I think this goes far
   beyond a crush," confides a friend of Hilton's. "Every time her phone
   rings, it's Ken. He calls more than any other guy, even more than her
   boyfriends."

   <p>The relationship has clearly benefited Baker, who is seen as something
   of a wunderkind in the business for his ability to bring in celebrity
   exclusives. Since Paris first appeared on the national scene in 2003
   with her infrared sex tape, Us Weekly has broken the lion's share of
   Hilton-related scoops--her break-up with Nick Carter, her harrowing
   account of her hacked Sidekick ordeal, and her engagement to Paris
   Latsis. (The couple's breakup, we broke. US weekly followed up a week
   later with the "official" story, straight from Hilton herself.)

   <p>What could the two possibly be talking about? According to a mag
   insider, "Paris uses Ken to plant negative items about her enemies,
   like Nicole Richie." In fact, one of the memos found on Hilton's
   pilfered Sidekick--"tell ken about jess trying to bone JT"--was widely
   deciphered as a reminder to tell Baker that Jessica Simpson was
   stalking the wild Timbersnake. (The phone's address book, conveniently
   enough, contained Baker's digits, too.)

   <p>Even in public, Baker has made little attempt to conceal his
   admiration for his prize canary: he once told Fox News' Greta Van
   Susteran, "When it comes to Paris Hilton, you either love her, loathe
   her, or lust after her, but either way ... you have to admit she's
   fascinating," and even based a character on her--the inventively named
   London Marriott--in his new satirical roman a clef, Hollywood Hussein.

   <p>Sadly, the feeling apparently isn't mutual: "Paris thinks it's funny
   when he calls, and will sometimes taunt and even abuse him," says
   Hilton's pal. "She brags that he's obsessed with her and wants to fuck
   her." That's gratitude for you.

   <p>Asked about his special friendship with the hotel heiress, Baker
   played down his role in bringing home the Hilton bacon and denied
   there was any "quid pro quo" involved. "Paris has chosen to give
   exclusive interviews to Us on several occasions because, I would
   imagine, she realizes our young readership is her fan base," he said.

   <p>"Also, Us Weekly has covered several major news events concerning
   Paris Hilton with aggressive journalism. For example, we were the only
   magazine to run a cover on her Sidekick scandal and, most recently, we
   broke news that Paris had `stolen' Mary Kate Olsen's boyfriend. I'd
   imagine Paris would have prefered these stories weren't given so much
   coverage, but as a news magazine that is our responsibility to our
   readers."

   <p>Baker went on to say that the idea Paris toyed with him on the phone
   was a "fiction," adding that he hadn't interviewed her in over a
   month. "If you hear from her, tell her I said `Hi!'"

   <p>We tried to, but Hilton's crisis manager, Elliot Mintz, did not return
   calls or e-mails, and her publicist, PMK's Jack Ketsoyan, was
   "traveling" and could not be reached.

<h>Rick Hilton Ticks off Cartier

   <p>While Paris Hilton's high-profile bad behavior has broughther
   international acclaim, her father Rick Hiltonseems to lack the Midas
   touch of turning personal obnoxiousness into celebritygold. According
   to a source who spotted the reality show paterfamiliasat the Cartier
   flagship store in Manhattan Monday afternoon, Hilton left patronsand
   staff there appalled at his bad manners.

   <p>"I was sitting next to him on the sofa, and he had this very
   arrogantposture, with his ankle over his knee and his arm slung over
   his chair while hetalked loudly on his cell phone," says our source,
   who was waiting to pickup a watch. "I knew I knew him from somewhere,
   and then a young woman[from Cartier] approached him, saying, `Hilton!
   Hilton! Mr. Hilton!'He didn't move, he didn't acknowledge anybody, he
   just kept gabbingon his cell phone, saying, `I don't know why I kept
   this watch, Iliked the other one I had.' Yap, yap, yap."

   <p>We're told that when customers complained and asked the clerk if
   theycould be helped while the flush-faced 50-year-old hotel heir
   chatted away onhis phone, "She said, `Oh, I have to take care of Mr.
   Hilton,'and kind of rolled her eyes." Visibly annoyed, the clerk
   called out,"Mr. Hilton!" and he closed his phone and "went up to
   takecare of whatever business he had to take care of."

   <p>As soon as Hilton left, the clerk turned to our source and cracked,
   "Ohwell, I guess you can't buy class."

   <p>Called for comment, an employee at the Cartier store on Fifth Avenue
   and 52ndStreet said she did not recall the incident. Hilton could not
   be reached bypress time.

<h>Jacko's White House Connection

   <p>Gay pornographer Marc Schaffel may be suing his former close friend
   Michael Jackson, but we hear that the filmmaker was once very useful
   to the King of Pop--thanks, in part, to his highly placed contact
   within the White House.

   <p>Schaffel--who recently aired a phone message on Good Morning America
   in which the singer declares, "I love you, Marc. I really need you to
   get $7 million for me as soon as possible"--is seeking $3 million in
   loans to Jackson that remain unpaid. But not long ago he was loyally
   working as the gloved one's business partner and producer on both his
   disastrous 2001 album Invincible and a 9/11 tribute concert Jackson
   planned to hold in Washington D.C. Jacko watchers may also recall
   Schaffel's star turn as an unindicted co-conspirator in the singer's
   most recent round of pedophilia allegations.

   <p>It was for the 9/11 tribute project that Schaffel (who, under the nom
   de porn "Marc Fredericks," has directed over 400 gay porn titles
   including The Man With the Golden Rod and Cocktales), turned to David
   Kuo, then an adviser to President Bush and the deputy director of the
   Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives.

   <p>Jackson's script featured a little boy holding the hand of an older
   man on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial while 50 pop stars, including
   Britney Spears and Carlos Santana, sang the treacly song in the shadow
   of America's 16th president. There was just one snag: in the wake of
   the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon,
   Washington's memorial sites were closed or heavily secured. According
   to Joe Becker, a West Wing producer enlisted to work on the video for
   Jackson's tribute, Kuo was the team's "man in the White House."

   <p>Despite the lockdown, Jackson and Schaffel were cleared to make the
   video at the site. "Representatives of the Parks Service said that the
   go ahead for us to use the Lincoln Memorial had come straight from the
   White House," Becker recalls, adding that Jackson returned Kuo's favor
   by providing backstage passes to a concert at RFK Stadium in D.C., and
   that the presidential adviser then "invited members of my staff to the
   concert and had them over to the White House mess hall for lunches."

   <p>In the end, the project was scuttled after Schaffel's XXX-rated resume
   became public. Becker says he lost $120,000 of his own money that he
   had invested in the filming, expecting to be reimbursed.

   <p>"When it came out that Schaffel was in gay porn and that Jackson had
   some serious legal problems, Kuo tried to act like he never knew
   them," Becker said. "It would have been laughable if I hadn't been
   taken for all that money."

   <p>Reached for comment, Kuo acknowledged that he had met with both
   Schaffel and Jackson about the tribute--"I met with hundreds of people
   a week at the White House"--but denied that he had helped gain them
   access to the Lincoln Memorial. "After 9/11 the White House was tasked
   with reaching out to people from the charitable world and Jackson had
   gotten in touch with us about some song that he was doing just like he
   had done `We are the World,'" Kuo said. "I didn't have a relationship
   with either guy, and I never invited staff on the project to come eat
   lunch at the cafeteria."

   <p>Kuo claims that concert promoter Clear Channel, not Jackson, provided
   his backstage passes to the RFK concert. And his opinion of Jackson?
   "I met him for a few minutes," Kuo said, "and I had no particular
   reaction." Kuo insisted that as far as he knew, no pedophilia charges
   had been brought against Jackson at the time.

   <p>Kuo has since stepped down from the Office of Faith-Based and
   Community Initiatives to take a contributing editor position at
   beliefnet.org, which recently published his attack on the
   administration for not doing enough for religious groups ("There was
   minimal senior White House commitment to the faith-based agenda," he
   wrote). A spokeswoman for the office did not return calls by press
   time.

<h>Is Bubba Hedging His Bets For `08?

   <p>Though the pundits have all but ordained her as the Democrats' next
   presidential nominee, it hasn't been all smooth sailing for Sen.
   Hillary Clinton. Publicly at least, the junior Senator from New York
   still insists she hasn't made up her mind about a presidential run.
   But while her coy denials and growing war chest have kept many
   Democratic opponents on the sidelines, at least one party poobah has
   not been shy about checking out her competition. Sources close to the
   Democratic National Committee claim that Bill Clinton has recently
   held a series of secret meetings with Virginia Gov. Mark Warner, a
   much-hyped party moderate who is rapidly emerging as his wife's most
   significant challenger for the Democratic nomination.

   <p>The affable, press-friendly Warner recently sealed his star status in
   the party after engineering the election of his lieutenant governor,
   Tim Kaine, to take his place in the governor's mansion, handing the
   Dems one of their most significant electoral victories in
   traditionally red-state Virginia earlier this month. Sources say the
   former president has grown enamored of Warner, a detail-oriented
   policy wonk who, like Clinton, rose to prominence as the moderate
   governor of a conservative Southern state.

   <p>Even as she fights off competition from the right, Hillary has other
   problems to worry about. As a host of prospective opponents, including
   senators John Kerry, Joe Biden, and Barack Obama, have lined up to
   demand a swift departure from Iraq, Mrs. Clinton's stay-the-course
   message has eroded her support among the party's progressives. Furious
   over her refusal to join a growing chorus of Democratic voices calling
   for an immediate withdrawal, a few leading party doves are accusing
   the former first lady of putting politics before principle in an
   effort to cultivate New York's Jewish vote.

   <p>"I think a lot of Democrats were surprised when she said that we
   should stay in Iraq at least through the December Iraqi elections,"
   says one high-level party insider. "But you can't win New York State
   without the support of the state's pro-Israel Jewish community." While
   pundits claim that Democrat contendors historically need two thirds of
   the Jewish vote in New York to win a Senate campaign, Clinton received
   a mere 53 percent in her 2000 run against Rick Lazio--a scare she
   presumably doesn't want to see repeated.

   <p>But the senator's supporters dismiss this charge as "ridiculous,"
   pointing out that polls show that the state's Jewish community is as
   divided about the war as the general electrorate is. "It's just race
   baiting," claims an aggreived Clinton pal who is outraged by the
   Washington whisper campaign. "Their justified opposition to the war
   has caused them to adopt the GOP's worst tactics, but the poll numbers
   disprove the whole theory."

   <p>Due to the Thanksgiving holiday, reps for the Clintons and Governor
   Warner could not be reached for comment.
