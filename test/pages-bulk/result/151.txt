<h>My favourite author

   <p>People ask me about my favourite author sometimes. My tastes being
   different (since my IQ so obviously is, too), I haven't divulged it so
   far. But the time has come to spill the beans. My favourite writer is
   Abuzilowich Milasinovic.
   <p>Who's he? Oh, shame on you!
   <p>Abuzilowich Milasinovic was the first recipient of the Abuzilowich
   Milusinovic award for emerging talent. He won it in April 1998 for his
   book "Adding up the summers" and was the first Eskimo to win this
   award, which was not much of a surprise since he was actually the
   first to win the award too.
   <p>It was he who put the Eskimos on the literary map by winning such a
   prestigious award. The literary world sat up, took notice and honoured
   his achievement by naming a prestigious award for emerging talent,
   prestigious because it was named after a legendary writer like him who
   had won it. So impressed were they that the award was instituted
   retrospectively from 1998 onwards. He went on to win it in the year of
   inception, as mentioned above.
   <p>In case you do a google search on his name, you will find that
   "Abuzilowich Milasinovic did not match any documents". He clearly has
   done enough other things in life to not have the time for matching any
   documents, whatever that means.
   <p>Of late, he has been working as a career consultant. Before that, he
   was in an igloo for ages. I only know him through his work- and I
   don't mean the igloo by that.
   <p>I find Abuzilimovich Milasinovic's depiction of the sweltering Arctic
   summers to be extremely moving.
   <p>Below is an excerpt. He does tend to digress from the main point at
   times.:
   <p>"... It is difficult to juggle writing with career consultancy, as
   difficult as juggling snowballs in the harsh arctic summers, since
   they have an unfortunate tendency to turn to water in mid-juggle in
   the heat.
   <p>The sheer frustration at having to throw up the snowballs only to
   watch them melt makes me almost want to throw up, and I am not
   referring to the snowballs when I say "want to throw up". Though a
   teetotaller, the sight of seeing the balls melt when so high has made
   me crave for a highball a couple of times, and once again I am not
   referring to the snowballs when I say "crave for a highball." That is
   the price I have to pay for having an oddball hobby, and for the third
   time, I must clarify that I am not actually referring to the snowballs
   themselves when I say oddball hobby.
   <p>Any allusion to the tragedy mentioned above depresses me, so after the
   paragraph above, I'm not exactly dancing with joy. I'm less close to
   dancing with joy than I was on that tragic afternoon two months ago
   when I narrowly missed the world record of juggling a snowball (Yes,
   juggling just one. That's the hardest.) for 337 minutes when it melted
   after 336 minutes and 40 seconds.
   <p>I broke down at having lost an opportunity to break the world record.
   The only mitigating factor was that it was my own mark that I was
   trying to best, and that I had bettered my world record 392 times
   already, since nobody else actually juggled with one ball, let alone a
   snowball. However, it was catastrophic enough to melt even a heart of
   stone, and no, I do not mean melt literally, as in melting a snowball.
   (What a depressing couple of paragraphs these have been. I must
   remember to never mention this snowball diversion again to anybody.)
   <p>In fact, I have decided that I should do away with one of my main
   professions, where I do not count the dalliance with snowball juggling
   as a full-fledged profession. I did career consultancy for myself to
   find out which one I should stick on to- writing or career
   consultancy, and abandoned writing.
   <p>But now that I've written about the experience, I find myself on the
   horns of a nightmarish logical catch 22 ish dilemma, which is as
   difficult to come out of as, as I have mentioned previously, juggling
   writing with career consultancy or juggling snowballs in the harsh
   arctic summers. It has snowballed into a crisis of career threatening
   proportions, and no, I am definitely not alluding to juggling the
   snowballs when I say "snowballed into a crisis"..."
   <p>- from "Adding up the summers" by Abuzilimovich Milasinovic.
   <p>I believe he has a sequel titled "Chilling out in the winters" ready.
   Describes the tropical South Indian winters. Can't wait to get my
   hands on it. What a versatile writer!

<h>Jest not cricket

   <p>(Profiles of cricketers! What better topic can one put one's efforts
   into?
   <p>I'm not going to pretend that this is completely original. It is not
   an ethical scruple that comes in the way, but a knowledge that such
   plagiarism would be hard to carry off, considering how famous that
   post is.
   <p>However, I promise to not write even one sentence which has even a
   slight similarity with anything in that post. This might be construed
   as parodying Sidin. I don't want to do that.
   <p>No one makes fun of Sidin. Not even me.)
   <h>Sunil Gavaskar
   <p>Gavaskar decided early in his career to play only the balls that would
   get him out and to leave as many balls as possible. This would have
   been a sound strategy but for the fact that he was such a good batsman
   that only an unplayable ball could get him out. As a result, he could
   only play the unplayable balls and tried to do so for the first two
   years of his career with catastrophic results. Wisely, he soon
   realised that this was impossible, and took the career-changing
   decision to not play any ball.
   <p>Consequently, he wasn't the most exciting of batsmen to watch. His
   primary contribution has been to develop 8137 ways of not offering a
   shot. The only hope for bowlers was that Gavaskar would put himself to
   sleep which rarely happened once he got his eye in.
   <p>He is the first cricketer to have been the answer to a quiz question ,
   the question being "Who is the first cricketer to be the answer to a
   quiz question?"
   <p>Gavaskar's most memorable innings came in his debut 20-20 match.
   Chasing 56 for victory, he scored a glorious unbeaten hundred in 853
   balls and singlehandedly led India to a famous win with 33.4 overs to
   spare. It was an innings that will not be forgotten by those who
   managed to watch it completely which, incidentally, was the attendance
   on the day- crowd who left in disgust- crowd who fell ill due to
   boredom- crowd who were evicted for throwing stones.
   <p>Old timers still mention the innings fondly, usually preceded by the
   words "Thank God I missed..." Some of his play outside his offstump
   has become legendary. Spectators recall the ball hitting the wicket
   keeper's gloves with a sweet thud when he left it outside the
   offstump, which was most of the time.
   <p>He also played an unforgettable innings chasing 138 in a Test Match
   and led India to the threshold of victory. It was a testament to his
   ability to shut off eveything but the ball. India eventually finished
   on 134/0. Scoring 6 runs in 107 balls when his opening partner had
   scored a 100 in 90 balls was a staggering achievement, but doing so
   when India needed quick runs was the mark of a champion. Gavaskar
   later said that it was very much like Bradman's 254 at Lord's- every
   ball went where he wanted it to go, to the keeper.
   <p>Gavaskar expressed delight at being unbeaten at the end, particularly
   because he was beaten virtually throughout the innings. Such, he
   wrote, are the delightful paradoxes of the game.
   <p>The only blot in his career has been accusations from animal lovers
   that another of his glittering knocks at Lords was responsible for the
   unfortunate death of Peter, the Lord's cat, due to sheer boredom, in
   1965. Gavaskar has always denied these allegations.
   <p>Staunchly proud of his coutry, he attacked a ticket counter at Lord's
   which refused to sell tickets to Indians, accusing them of racism. He
   put his reputation on the line to stand up for his country men. It is
   another matter that the tickets were not being sold to Englishmen
   also, primarily because all the tickets had been sold out. Whichever
   way, it is remembered today as the most daring, and in fact only,
   counterattack in his long career.
   <p>Dennis Lilee said of him- "I'd like to see him play with a stump- I'm
   sure he'd do okay since he hardly makes contact with the ball anyway."
   <p>With the emergence of Gavaskar, a nation woke up to the fact that come
   rain or shine, cricket would always be sunny from then on- as sunny,
   pleasant and comfortable as a Chennai summer day.
   <h>Anil Kumble
   <p>Anil Kumble was to bowling what Dravid is to batting. Dravid redefined
   batting by not playing a shot, Kumble redefined spin bowling by not
   spinning the ball. Dravid was associated with the straight bat; Kumble
   with the straight ball.
   <p>It is an irony that a man named after a circle preferred to bowl
   straight. This wasn't because he couldn't spin the ball. One of the
   cleverest bowlers of all time, Kumble estimated early on in his career
   that a leg break- googly bowler could beat batsmen only half the time-
   either when he played a leg break mistaking it for a googly or when he
   played a googly mistaking it for a legbreak. He discovered that if he
   bowled straight, a batsman playing either for the googly or the leg
   break could be foxed.
   <p>Consequently, his leg breaks never turned. He had a variation- the
   deadly flipper which was bowled with the same action as the leg break
   and didn't turn. In fact, it was identical to the leg break in all
   respects, except that he called it a flipper.
   <p>To understand how this enabled him to get wickets, one should remember
   again that Kumble was one of the cleverst cricketers to have played
   the game. Having read in his childhood how Clarie Grimett used to snap
   his fingers, thus leading to the impression that he had bowled a
   flipper, and then bowl a leg break, Kumble used to do the same.
   <p>The batsmen, having read the Grimett story themselves, would realise
   that Kumble was bowling the leg break while pretending to bowl the
   flipper.
   <p>Howeve, since they also knew that the two were the same, this paradox
   would so confuse them that they would be dazed for a while. One second
   of indecision against Kumble would of course be deadly.
   <p>Kumble's moment of glory came when he took 10 wickets in an innings
   against Pakistan. The umpiring decisions were all correct, though one
   of them, that of Akram being given out leg before wicket when Younis
   was in fact the batsman facing, is sometimes debated.
   <p>On Indian tracks against lefthanders in the second innings, Kumble was
   deadly, especially if the track had stones planted on it at crucial
   spots. He used to call them 'his precious stones."
   <p>Kumble is particularly noted for his dive. The dive was always like
   the rotation of the windmill which allows the wind to pass through.
   Stopping the ball was never the priority. After all, why risk getting
   injured when the whole team depended on you?
   <p>Never one to stand in the way of young talent, Kumble has decided to
   call it a day when people ask why and not why not. In an announcement
   that made his sacrifice and quest towards perfection abundantly clear,
   he said in a recenrt conference that he would retire after taking
   eleven wickets in an innings.
   <p>When a journalist reminded him that it had never happened so far, he
   said that that was precisely the reason why he wanted to be the first
   to do it. Since he had taken 10 wickets in an innings once, he hoped
   to be able to replicate the feat, since everyone knew that No. 11 was
   the easiest to get out. His logic was as sharp as ever.
   <p>A career that started with a paradox has ended in one- people wonder
   how this gentle giant, this non-spinning spinner can simultaneously be
   the proud master of world cricket while being a humble servant of
   Indian cricket. Such are the questions that this cricketer who had all
   the answers will leave for us.
   <p>All said and done, Kumble is undoubtedly the finest spinner to ever
   play cricket and the second best leg spinner India has ever produced.
   <h>Venkatesh Prasad
   <p>Prasad had a fascination for the theory of relativity and spent his
   career examining whether there was a lower limit for speed. The speed
   at which Prasad bowled has now been accepted as the lowest possible
   velocity possible.
   <p>Prasad had a very good record against many batsmen, especially the
   ones he had never bowled to. Among batsmen he did bowl to, Gary
   Kirsten was his bunny.
   <p>It all started when Prasad bowled Gary Kirsten in the second innings
   with a ball he bowled in the South African first innings. Kirsten was
   so bamboozled by this incident that he used to quake in his boots when
   facing Prasad later on.
   <p>Kirsten said once that facing Prasad was his most educative experience
   on the Cricket field, since he used to read the autobiographies of
   famous batsmen when waiting for the ball to arrive. He claimed to have
   read more books in this fashion than in his entire life outside the
   stadium.
   <p>Frequently, Prasad bowled so slow that all six of his balls in the
   over were in the air at the same time. This enabled India to take 6
   new balls. This was his primary contribution to the team and the
   reason why his slow ball was considered to be such an asset.
   <p>Prasad's batting was less of an asset. In fact, he was such a horrible
   batsmen that even net bowlers refused to bowl to him, saying they'd
   rather bowl at the stumps without a batsman.
   <p>To improve his batting credentials without taking recourse to any
   other bowler having to bowl at him, he devised the unique training
   regimen of bowling in the morning, having lunch and a siesta and
   returning late afternoon to face the balls that he had bowled in the
   morning. His batting against himslef improved by leaps and bounds.
   However, facing himself was hardly the ideal preparation to face any
   bowler who bowled faster than a lethargic snail and consequently, his
   batting at the international stage hardly showed any signs of
   improvement.
   <p>He worked on his fielding to make up, and toward the end of his
   career, so improved his fielding that he was able to reach as close to
   any ball in the outfield as possible without actually being near
   enough to stopping it. This gave Indian cricket its second enduring
   image of the 90s along with the Kumble dive, that of the ball crossing
   the boundary and Prasad running past it just after the nick of time.
   The distance between him and the ball has now been accepted by
   physicists as the shortest distance possible.
   <p>After a glorious few years, Prasad lost his place in the side when the
   selectors found out that the years had taken their toll and that he
   had lost his lack of pace. He announced his retirement when his
   bowling slowed down so much that he had diffulty in getting the ball
   to come out of his hand.
   <h>Ajit Agarkar
   <p>Agarkar is the only cricketer to have his biography started during his
   playing career. However, the book is yet to be finished because a
   chapter on three reasons why he's not a total waste as a cricketer is
   still not completed even after three months of it having been started.
   <p>Agarkar is an animal and bird lover with a particular liking for
   ducks. A team mate challenged him to eat duck for five meals in a row.
   He lost the bet, but made amends on the cricket field.
   <p>Widely panned for being short and wide all the time, he once bowled
   eighty balls without even one being short and wide. This was
   particularly impressive when you consider that all of them were either
   short or wide. He went for 137 runs, but not before he had
   demonstrated his point.
   <p>As a bowler, his variety was bewildeing. His arsenal included bouncers
   outside off and down leg, full tosses, overpitched deliveries, noballs
   and wides. He is the only bowler to have achieved the quadruple (the
   feat of bowling at least one wide each down leg side and outside off
   stump to both lefties and righties in the same match) 50 times.
   <p>He used to practise with a red carpet laid out on the entire pitch. He
   used to be able to pitch the ball anywhere outside the carpet at will,
   in keeping with the great traditions of Indian fast bowlers. This used
   to be called Agarkar's red carpet welcome to batsmen.
   <h>Sachin Tendulkar
   <p>Though considered to be among the modern greats, Sachin Tendulkar has
   many weaknesses.
   <p>For example, he is particularly susceptible against fast bowling.
   Once, Shoaib Akhtar bowled him with a ball faster than the speed of
   light. Some attributed this to the fact that at those speeds, the mass
   of the ball becomes infinite, making it impossible to play. Sachin
   himself came up with the lamest of excuses saying that he had been
   unable to spot the ball.
   <p>His second weakness is a complete inability to play the unplayable
   ball.
   <p>But causing most concern to his fans is that he looks totally lost
   against both Shane Warne's doosra and Murali's googly. In the Adelaide
   Test match of 2003-2005, Murali bowled him thrice in an innings with a
   googly. Warne went one better by taking a rare hattrick- he had Sachin
   bowled, lbw and caught in the deep all in one ball.
   <p>Tendulkar's other main weaknesses are listed below:
   <l>1. Can't play spin
   <l>2. Can't play left arm medium pace
   <l>3. Can't play incoming ball from the right hand medium pacer
   <l>4. Can't play outgoing balls from the right hand medium pacer
   <l>5. Can't play short/full length balls/ yorkers.
   <p>Also, he has a tendency to be caught behind when playing on the off
   side, lbw when playing on the legside and bowled when playing
   straight.
   <p>It is a mystery how he has scored so many runs, one that has baffled
   analysts for long.
   <p>He cannot play under pressure- his matchwinning innings at Sharjah
   were due to the fact that a sand storm had reduced the atmospheric
   pressure.
   <p>Contrary to poplular belief, he did not play well in the crucial World
   Cup Match against Pakistan- the Pakistani players are even worse under
   pressure.
   <p>Tendulkar has had a colourful career. His contests with leading
   bowlers have made compelling viewing though most of them have got the
   better of him, sometimes using unconventional methods.
   <p>Famously, McGrath came up with the ace strategy of bowling to him with
   an invisible ball. Tendulkar had no answer to that delivery which
   McGrath insists was an inswinger and was trapped in front of the
   stumps. It was a victory for the bowler, who prior to the delivery had
   asked Tendulkar to hit it if he could.
   <p>Umpire Buckner was involved in this controversial dismissal. In his
   autobiography, "A law unto himself", he mentions that that "Tendulkar
   played down the wrong line", was "palpably plumb" and that that was
   "the best ball that he had never seen."
   <p>Tendulkar's bowling has proved to be very useful. He counts Inzy Ul
   Haq among his bunnies, so fact which was immortalised in a recent
   newspaper heading, "End-UL-HAQ kar?"
   <p>Such complimentary headings cannot hide the fact that Tendulkar has
   himself been the bunny of many bowlers- McGrath dismissed him 540
   times, which forms a major proportion of his 500 Test wickets. Razzaq,
   Pollock and Kumble have also had a lot of success against him at the
   international level.
   <p>Surprisingly, Buckner has dismissed him more number of times than even
   McGrath. What is stunning has been that Buckner has dismissed him in
   every way possible- many times lbw, equally as many times caught
   behind, a couple of times for obstructing the non striker, thrice for
   handling the bat, four times for obstructing the sun, seven times bat
   before wicket, twice for running on the pitch and once for beating
   Lara to 10,000 runs.
   <p>Buckner has also given him out once, since he predicted that he would
   show dissent when being given out. Tendulkar promptly protested, thus
   completely vindicating Buckner's decision.
   <p>In addition, he has also got him out in modes that are too ridiculous
   to be discussed here.
   <h>Ravi Shastri
   <p>Ravi Shastri once played an innings so glittering that that led Edison
   to invent the bulb. This was when he hit a 100 in 20 balls against
   Germany. The last 50 runs were particularly breathtaking and came off
   just 35 balls.
   <p>Shastri was the first to complete the all rounder's double of clean
   bowling himself 510 times and hitting 100 sixes of his own bowling. He
   was such a supreme all rounder that he frequently used to clean bowl
   himself and hit a six off himself off the same ball- a feat that was
   unheard of till then.
   <p>However, he soon found that he was the ideal spin bowler. This
   discovery was made when he once pitched a ball outsde the stadium and
   turned it so much that it hit off stump.
   <p>Another time, called on to break an opening partnership between Shoaib
   Malik and Imran Farhat that was assuming threatening proportions, he
   did the unthinkable. He got so much drift with his very first delivery
   and gave it so much flight that the ball pitched in the dressing room
   and dismissed Inzy, who was due to bat one down, leg before wicket.
   That magic ball left Pakistan reeling at 735/1 without either opener
   having been dismissed. Such an instance had never happened before in
   the annals of cricket and has never happened since.
   <p>Umpire David Shepherd later wrote that it was "absolutelty plumb",
   saying it would have "gone on to clip leg stump". On a dead pitch not
   offering much turn, it was a sterling effort.
   <p>As a spinner, he had it all- flight, loop, turn, bite, bounce, drift,
   nip and real purchase off the wicket. The amount of turn he extracted
   meant that the wicketkeeper had to field at point most of the time. He
   got so much purchase off the wicket that he used to finish all his
   shopping during the match.
   <p>As a batsman, he was also a proponent of the SPCB movement- Society
   for Prevention of Cruelty to Balls. He used to charge down the track
   and defend balls with a dead bat.
   <p>He used to see the ball early and play it late- so much so that he
   sometimes saw the ball before the bowler bowled it and played it after
   it hit the stumps.
   <p>Though a defensive player at times, he could drive beautifully-
   especially when he wasn't drunk. This explains why he was given a car
   in the World Championship of Cricket in 1985.
   <h>Rajk
   <p>Rajk started off as a fast bowler who used to run so fast when
   delivering the ball that the momentum took him past the stumps in his
   follow through, and the wicket keeper had to catch him before he
   reached the boundary. He remains the only player to be caught behind
   regularly off his own bowling. This sight was so arresting that he
   frequently forgot to deliver the ball and batsmen forgot to play the
   undelivered ball, thus getting out to him.
   <p>Later, he switched to leg spin bowling and would have played for India
   but for Kumble's arrival on the scene, much like Rajinder Goel and
   Bedi.
   <p>He was hammered by any factor and hampered by many factors. He bowled
   with a Tennis ball, which made drift very hard to obtain. He
   compensated for this by judicious use of the seam. Secondly, he bowled
   on pitches fields where the tracks were not conducive to spin bowling.
   But the biggest hurdle was unimaginative captaincy. Not realising that
   attacking spinners were bound to be hit around a bit, captains
   immediately took him off the attack after conceding 50 runs from 2
   overs.
   <p>Also a spectacular fielder, he once ran 100 metres and with the match
   delicately poised, took a stunning one handed catch diving forward at
   full stretch, only to realise that he had run into the adjoining field
   and caught a catch when they were practising high catches before the
   game.
   <p>The unltimate compliment came from Tendulkar, who said that "Rajk was
   without doubt the best legspinner to never play the game."
   <h>Javagal Srinath
   <p>The toughest five balls he bowled were the ones he bowled wide off the
   off stump so that Kumble could pick up the last wicket after he had
   taken nine wickets against Pakistan. For an accurate bowler like him,
   it would have been near impossible. He relished the challenge so much
   that he bowled similar balls throughout his career afrter that.
   <p>Such was his control that he used to practise with a hanky on the
   pitch on a good length spot and not hit it throughout practice, even
   if he bowled 10000 balls. This proves the awesome variety of his
   bowling.
   <h>Saurav Ganguly
   <p>He famously hit an explosive hundred against SL in Taunton with so
   many sixes that the residents of the town thought they were being
   bombed.
   <p>Towards the end of his career, Ganguly spent 20% of the time
   convincing the media that he'd never fought with Greg Chappell, 20%
   convincing them that he didn't have a problem with the short ball, and
   60% convincing them that he'd never fought with Greg Chappel about
   having a problem with the short ball. The remaining time he spent in
   improving his rapport with the coach and comfort factor against the
   short ball.
   <p>His inclusion/exclusion in the team was used by scientists at the
   University of Michigan as the starting point for random number
   generation. It is said that Dravid used to carry a coin around with
   him and toss it to determine whether Ganguly should play or not.
   <p>His career ended when Greg Chappel suggested a new system whereby the
   coin was substituted by two dice. If the sum of the two scores on
   rolling them was greater than 14, Ganguly would play.
   <p>Ganguly also played soccer. Dravid had a high regard for Ganguly's
   abilities as a soccer player, once paying him the ultimate compliment-
   that if he played soccer with God, God would be off side first and
   then Ganguly. His natural instinct to kick the ball led to a large
   number of lbw dismissals while playing cricket.
   <p>A wonderful defender, he could play on either wing. By an amazing
   coincidence, like in cricket, Ganguly alternated between being left
   out and being right back in soccer too.
   <h>Rahul Dravid
   <p>The great batsmen make fielders redundant by the brilliance of their
   stroke play. Dravid is the greatest of them all- he makes fielders
   redundant by refusing to play any shot.
   <p>Most batsmen have no shot as their favourite. Dravid's favourite is no
   shot. While other batsmen would play bread and butter shots, he would
   offer none and hence got the nickname of "Jammie".
   <p>He is a textbook cricketer- a champion at book cricket, which is also
   the only game where he ever scored more than two runs in one try.
   <p>Dravid has always been a tough nut to crack for opposing captains.
   This is particularly true of one-day cricket where over the first half
   of his career, opposing captains worried themselves sick about how to
   get him out.
   <p>However, he evolved as a batsman, like all champion cricketers do, and
   posed tougher questions towards the second half of his career when
   captains started losing sleep over how to not get him out, since they
   felt their best chance was to keep him at the crease.
   <p>In an ODI final recently, when Dravid was caught at point, he had
   faced 60 balls and had a strike rate of 5. The captain, who
   desperately hoped that the fielder would drop the ball, promptly
   admonished the fielder saying that "You've just caught the World cup,
   my son."
   <p>Dravid is famous for knowing where his offstump is. Once, when Lee had
   sent his offstump cartwheeling out of the ground, he was able to
   locate it in the crowd because he still knew where his off stump was.
   <p>Dravid's batting is built on sound fundamentals and the simple
   strategy of boring the bowler to death and putting the fielders to
   sleep. He then attempts to find the gaps between them.
   <p>Dravid is so strong on the leg side that 0-12 fields are frequently
   employed to stop him. He plays the swivel pull beautifully- eyes on
   the ball, rocking back, judging the length early. It is a shot of
   great beauty, especially in the rare instances when he succeeds in
   making contact with the ball too.
   <p>Dravid's batting philosophy in Tests is simple. Give the first 90
   overs each day to the bowler, see out even the horrible balls and and
   then look to dominate. This is not because of a limited repertoire of
   shots. He had all the shots in the book, but never plays even one in
   the interest of the team.
   <p>Wisden, talking about his debut innings, remarked that "Dravid, a
   compulsive leaver of the ball, played an innings so breathtaking that
   it was supposed to be the best innings by him in England till then"
   and added that "so pretty was the innings that it was even prettier
   than Ganguly's cherubic face when he was in a deep slumber at the
   non-striker's end. Fielders stood rooted to the ground, maybe because
   they figured out they weren't required since no shot was being played.
   Some say that they were actually in a stupor induced daze. It is even
   rumoured that a couple were sleepwalking."
   <p>He frequently dropped anchor, doing to the team's score what an anchor
   does to a ship.
   <p>But his finest hour was an innings that is still talked off with awe
   by people fortunate enough to see it. India were in a crisis as usual.
   In an innings of vintage class, Dravid showcased his superb defensive
   technique- getting in line with the ball and playing it with a still
   head and a dead bat. He proceeded to do this ball after ball, six
   times in a row.
   <p>So complete was his mastery that he even defended balls which were
   wide outside off and down leg, which would have been called wides. It
   was such an astonishing display under the circumstances that even the
   fielding team purportedly patted him on the back after the over.
   <p>Nothing- not even the docile nature of the track, the utter
   ineffectiveness of the bowling or the fact that India required 24 runs
   in 12 balls at the beginning of that over- could shake his resolve. He
   was a batsman well and truly in the zone.
   <p>Sadly, Tendulkar, uninspired by such mastery of defence, chickened out
   and took the easy way out by hitting the last six balls for four. As
   ever, in a country that refuses to acknowledge any other batsman, all
   the plaudits went to him.

<h>Business to back

   <p>Why haven't I posted? It's a long story. But before I tell you that,
   lemme tell you how it all started.
   <p>It all started a while back, while I was in office.
   <p>"Are you sleeping?", my boss asked me.
   <p>The thing about such questions is that you've got to meet them not
   just with an answer but also an explanation.
   <p>"No, I'm just lying down because that's when you best use your brain.
   At least that's what I read in the papers recently"
   <p>He hesitated for a while and asked me if it really was so.
   <p>"Of course it is", said I, "Have you ever dreamt when you're awa...
   er, not lying down?"
   <p>He thought for a while. He considered the question from all angles and
   admitted he hadn't.
   <p>"That's the magic of lying down", I said, "That's when you dream.
   That's when you get visions. And what is life without dreams?"
   <p>I knew I had won the day when I managed to get "vision" into the whole
   thing. But for good measure, I added, "Even though lying down is good
   for you, if you attack my dedication to work, I won't take it lying
   down."
   <p>This was followed by a polite laugh, just so that he wouldn't take
   that as a threat.
   <p>He didn't. With a dreamy look in his eyes, he said he'd been looking
   for somebody to assist him in an ambitious endeavour. That was the
   beginning of how I got lumbered with this tough assignment, which has
   kept me busy for the past few days.
   <p>I've been busy over the first few days of the past few days watching
   grass grow and watching paint dry. The two were meant to prepare
   myself for the last undertaking. Those were not particularly
   candidates for the most exciting days of my life. Between the two,
   watching paint dry was more satisfying, if you get my drift. I mean,
   you can't be certain whether the grass has grown and all that, but
   with paint you can be sure.
   <p>And then I got my assignment. The mail said- "Discuss urgently: Dodo."
   <p>The first line he spoke to me when I met him was, "Congrats! You've
   been chosen to spot a Dodo."
   <p>"A dodo? But... a dodo hasn't even been spotted for a long time. I
   believe they're extinct", I said, shocked.
   <p>He said that that was the challenge of the whole thing. It was not a
   big deal, he said, spotting a crow, for example, but a dodo
   represented an opportunity. That's why I'd been handpicked to do it.
   <p>Good logic, that was. But I couldn't stand around appreciating it. I
   had dodos to spot.
   <p>I took the bull by the horns. With trepidation, I set out for my
   vantage point. The first day was pretty bad. I tried to get a dekko of
   a Dodo and failed. The second day was worse. I tried and failed again.
   The third day... well, I guess you can take it from there.
   <p>So I went back to him and told him that I didn't think I'd be able to
   do it.
   <p>"I knew it", he said, grinning.
   <p>I wanted to say I knew it too. But the thought crossed my mind for a
   second whether the whole thing wasn't unfair. I mean say you know
   something's impossible, why would you ask somebody to do it?
   <p>Only for a second mind you. Because the second second was taken up by
   absorbing what he was trying to say next.
   <p>"I want you to collect material on the dodo on an emergency basis.
   Basically, we want to be ready in case we're attacked by dodos. I have
   reasons to believe that this is highly probable in the distant
   future."
   <p>So I went about trying to do that. You won't believe the kind of
   resistance I encountered when I tried to do that. People said they'd
   never even seen a Dodo. I said that's why it was an emergency. I mean
   if you haven't even seen a dodo, what chance have you when something
   happens, say when you're attacked by a million dodos?
   <p>But that didn't convince anybody. So I went back to my boss and told
   him I was convinced it was impossible to convince a soul.
   <p>"Impossible is nothing, is impossible" , he mumbled.
   <p>"I didn't get that', I said, furiously scratching my head.
   <p>"Oh, sorry. That's a board room hangover. Now that the Adidas
   punchline is fashionable, I don't know whether to say impossible is
   nothing or nothing is impossible. So I take no chances", he said, with
   a wicked grin.
   <p>"But this statement doesn't make any sense.", I tried arguing.
   <p>"Hey, it's used only in corporate meetings, ok."
   <p>Good logic. Can't argue with that. Anyway, he said I'd been chosen to
   stretch the frontiers of the human spirit. The chapter entitled
   "Anti-dodo enabling" was to be written by me.
   <p>"I created the whole thing", he said proudly. "There was no such
   chapter initially. Talk about lack of foresight", he said, chuckling.
   <p>That's how I started work on the chapter. I mean that sounded like a
   huge thing to do, stretching the frontiers and all that.
   <p>My boss kept giving me weird feedback. Once, he said that I had talent
   as a comic writer, an addition to what I thought was a considerable
   list of talents.
   <p>"If you write stuff like this, people will laugh at you." That's
   exactly what he said. Talk of oblique compliments.
   <p>It took me a long time, this chapter did, but now I am, as I said,
   over and done with it.
   <p>This presents with infinite possibilities when schmoozing in the
   office and listening to colleagues boasting about their achievements.
   <p>For example, I overheard the following conversation the other day:
   <p>"I've increased sales in the southeastern part of northwestern Siberia
   by 0.04%. You?" , said braggart 1.
   <p>"I brought about a 300% increase in the sale of a water purifier in
   the middle of the Sahara desert. ", said braggart 2.
   <p>"I increased sales of antiperspirants in the arctic by infinity', said
   braggart 3.
   <p>"How did you do that?", asked braggart 1, enviously, incredulously.
   <p>"I didn't even go there. I just made a receipt and paid the money
   myself. We never sold any stuff out there. So you see, I've increased
   the sales by a factor of infinity. I'll get a very large bonus which
   more than covers the cost of the stuff, which I paid for. Not to
   mention how happy my boss was. Everyone wins."
   <p>He thought he was a dead cert to win that one. Fat chance. He reckoned
   without me. Choosing my moment, I burst on the scene with the coup de
   grÃ¢ce:
   <p>"Huh, I've anti-Dodo-enabled the company. Frankly, what good is any of
   you?"
   <p>Braggart 1, braggart 2 and braggart 3 shrank away quickly into the
   oblivion of their cubicles with a mixture of hopelessness and
   apprehension. The little pleasures of life, to see your colleagues
   running scared of you.
   <p>So well, we're anti- Dodo enabled. Some people working in other
   companies heard this and were scared because they didn't know what it
   meant. One guy hadn't heard even of what a Dodo was. And us? We're
   anti-Dodo attack enabled.
   <p>I get awfully excited when somebody mentions the word "Dodo."
   <p>The other day, I jumped up and shouted "Where, where?" when my
   colleague said something about dodos. It turned out that he was just
   remarking that something was as dead as a dodo.
   <p>I told him- "You dud, you think Dodos are dead?", and he replied, "You
   dumbo, you think they're not?"
   <p>I almost felt like throwing him to the Dodos, to give him a scare,
   since they were herbivores, but you can't do that when you don't see
   them dodos in the first place, eh?
   <p>Doesn't matter. It's just a matter of time. The dodos are coming.
   <p>I dream of people reading the first line in my chapter sometime,
   "Dodos: Do's, don'ts".
   <p>I whisper the first few lines of the chapter to myself in my sleep
   sometimes, "The first don't is to avoid killing a dodo, whatever be
   the provocation, be it even that it is trying to kill you. This is
   because dodos are extinct and we can't afford to kill any more of
   them.
   <p>Also, dodos are prone to getting agitated very quickly, particularly
   if they have just been killed. So killing them will only exacerbate
   the situation if the dodo was agitated to start with ..."
   <p>Yes, I very much dream of a flock of dodos attacking the company and
   our repelling them all effortlessly.
   <p>It's thrilling. It really is.

<h>Love, love me do

   <p>Sarah braced herself up. They all said he was a bit of a smart-assed
   weirdo.
   <p>Tell me you love me if you think thatâs true was what sheâd said. What
   would he say?
   <p>âOf course Iâll say it, because itâs obviouslyâ¦â.
   <p>Her spirits rose.
   <p>âtrue. Yes, Sarah. Undoubtedly, you love me.â

<h>The master of war

   <p>The scene of war was buttered by sunlight, but even the battle-scarred
   general felt numb. The bodies, the dog tugging away at the fallen
   soldierâs uniform...
   <p>He turned away. Heâd never fight a war again.
   <p>A tear won the battle against his eyelid and broke free.
   <p>Someday, his son would be a truly great painter.

<h>To cut a long story short

   <p>A bead of sweat coursed down the know-all's face.
   <p>Two people wanted answers- simultaneously.
   <p>The guy at the left door asked the time. The guy at the right door
   asked his question. The same question came from the left two times
   more.
   <p>The know-all answered each time with mounting relief.
   <p>Thank God Borg had won 6-1 6-2 6-3!

<h>The big draw

   <p>This has been some match. And this has been some series. The last day
   means that drama has followed drama and a gut-wrenching final hour of
   the Test another similar one at Edgbaston as England strained every
   sinew to break the Australian resistance. Australia were eventually
   saved by a combination of grits, luck, and do not forget, weather.
   <p>It's a series that has had everything. This match had both captains
   returning to batting form. It also must have had Terry Alderman, the
   former Australian swing bowler, wondering whether he will be accused
   of abetting the Aussie batsmen in suicide. Here is what he said of
   Giles before the series:
   <p>"I definitely believe if any of our batsmen get out to Giles in the
   Tests they should go and hang themselves. But I'm confident that won't
   happen."
   <p>By a quirk of fate, Giles has got seven wickets and they have all been
   of top order batsmen. But the unbelievable fact is that they're all
   different. In other words, heâs snaffled each Aussie top order batter
   exactly once. It is as if the Gods wanted to join him in cocking a
   snook at the Aussies.
   <p>Alderman's not the only one who got a prediction wrong. In fact, would
   there be anybody who'd predicted even a fraction of the excitement,
   the thrills and spills we've already seen? As the by now famous line
   goes, this has been the best Test sinceâ¦ Edgbaston, of course!
   <p>There is no doubt as to which side played the better Cricket at Old
   Trafford. Any notions of an Australian superiority are as unfounded as
   a gazelle having a superiority complex because it has just escaped
   capture by a lion. England have their sights firmly set this time
   around. Australia have gone from the stalker to the stalked.
   <p>What of this series? Where does it go now? Can it get better? It seems
   unlikely, but weren't we wrong when we thought the same thing at
   Edgbaston?
   <p>The story of the match canât be easily told, but there were
   similarities to the Edgbaston Test- England with a huge first innings
   total and the Aussies shot out cheaply. The difference from Edgbaston
   is that only one side could have won this Test.
   <p>England are the more settled side, with every one of their batsmen
   having made a contribution and a bowling line up that has a settled
   look to it. Bell, Hoggard and Geriant Jones all made crucial
   contributions.
   <p>Though Flintoff didn't have to swing the match England's way this time
   with his bat, he did reverse swing it their way, ably helped by Simon
   Jones. Many Aussie batsmen looked clueless, not the least Katich and
   Clarke, both losing their stumps to some delightful reverse swing
   bowling.
   <p>Ponting played a wonderful knock, as did Vaughan a few days before
   him. When he fell with four overs to go, it seemed likely that
   Harmison had dealt the killer blow. But as I watched the final few
   balls of the match (in a pub, and in an indescribably tense
   atmosphere), the suspicion dawned on me that Australia might just hold
   on by the skin of their teeth. So it proved, but were they made to
   sweat it out or what!
   <p>There is the joy of the rebirth of the thrilling draw. A draw, or the
   possibility of one, along with a loss, win and tie has always been one
   of Test cricketâs attractions. This is something that one day cricket
   will always be bereft of. This draw flies in the face of all who
   believe that a drawn test cannot be a compelling watch.
   <p>There is also the joy of cricketâs rebirth in its native land, one
   that spurned it for football. Now, kicking the ball might take a back
   seat for a while at least while this battle captures the imagination
   of an entire nation. The Ashes, like England, have indeed risen from
   the ashes!
