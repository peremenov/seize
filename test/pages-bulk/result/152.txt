   <h>I Was Being Unmade

<h>February 07, 2005

<h>seeing

   <p>i stood shivering outside a cvs in boston waiting for my friend. a
   homeless man walked up to me and asked if i was a bum. i guess that
   doesn't say much for my appearance. i was wearing a ratty old jacket.
   i had been outside in the rain all day. i was carrying plastic bags
   filled with free things from the concert we'd helped at. i told him i
   was not a bum, and asked if he was. he said yes, and so i asked if he
   liked it. i don't know why i asked, and i don't know why i was
   surprised when he said no and walked away. for some reason i like that
   memory. i like that a bum talked to me as if i was a bum. i wish i
   could know what he was going to say to me before he found out i was
   too good for him.

   <p>when i'm at the hospital i pass a lot of cleaning ladies. i pass the
   same ladies because i spend my time there on the same hall on the 9th
   floor. i always smile and mumble a hello, but they rarely notice. they
   don't look up when i pass them. it bothers me that they won't notice
   me.

   <p>i was eating lunch out with my grandparents, and there was a beautiful
   tiny old woman eating alone across from us. i watched her carefully
   cut up her food, and slowly stir her tea. she was so small in the
   booth. so all alone.

   <p>there is a boy with down's syndrome at my church. he sings loudly with
   only a few of the right words, and all of the emphasis on the last
   word in each line. he plays ping pong with the other boys and hits the
   ball so hard it flies off the table. it makes him laugh hard. i watch
   him eat doughnuts alone in the corner. the more i watch him, the more
   i can't resist watching him.

   <p>i was walking to the checkout line in walmart looking into faces as i
   passed them when i saw a woman who looked like death. we were across
   from the the pink valentine display when we passed each other. she was
   bald under her black hood. her face was pale and hollow. i've seen
   bald women, and i've seen sickly faces, but i've never seen death on
   the living. it was startling. it made me question for a second if her
   face had survived a severe burn accident. the death stuck out like a
   missing appendage. it didn't frighten or sadden me, it made me want to
   walk around the store with her.

   <p>today i sat on the bleachers of the elementary school alternating
   between my book and watching my little sisters do their cheers for the
   fourth grade basketball team. i couldn't watch the game for more than
   10 seconds without staring at the shadows on the court and thinking
   about the boy on the sidelines in the wheelchair. he was watching his
   younger brother play. he had played basketball and soccer and football
   until a little over a year ago when an accident left him paralyzed.
   his life is defined now, and so is he. i wonder how it feels to know
   you will always be on the sidelines.

   <p>i don't know when i started noticing the unnoticed, but it hasn't been
   for long enough. i don't know why some people are ignored. i don't
   know why we don't think thoughts about them. i don't assume my
   thoughts about them are worth much. i do assume they don't want my
   pity thoughts. and i do have pity for them, but i also have questions.
   they must know things unnoticers miss knowing.

   <p>I call them "Thrown Away People".
   I have the same passion and am drawn to them.
   I am not sure other people understand my obsession.
   I am not sure other people realize how close we all are to being these
   thrown away people.

   <p>But even in their thrown away state I feel that they are more worthy
   than I. I hear your words. I feel your feelings. I appreciate that you
   see that they simply want acceptance just like we all do. That they
   have worth that most of us discard.

   You impress me so much. So much wisdom in just one person.

   <p>Take Care

   <p>... they are the broken hearted, the captives, the poor, the blind,
   lame and broken people, the oppressed ... to these we can proclaim the
   Lord's favour... those who are to know him will hear and believe.

   <p>And so I wonder .. Do they wan't questions, or answers? I think the
   later should always follow the former, even if we feel uncomfortable
   or think they don't want to hear. It is all easy said than done, and
   so we need his anointing.

   <p>May the Lord bless you Kelly as you minister his Name and his good
   news to the unnoticed.

   <p>michael. you are right, i really don't think people realize how close
   we are to being these people. i don't want to have to become one to
   make me notice and understand them on some level. and i think i am
   them at times...have been them before. thanks for your words. it's
   good to know you notice them.

   <p>amy. thank you. i prefer hymns.

   <p>peter. thanks for your words. i can't say i've done more than start to
   notice. but it's something.

   <p>I like what you said here... "they must know things unnoticers miss
   knowing."

   <p>I wonder if they noticed that you noticed them....? I wonder if the
   ladies who clean the hospital try to avoid looking up so that they
   don't have to face the rejection of not being noticed....

   <p>I was the noticed a while back... right before Christmas, I had some
   gum surgery which left me really very swollen, bruised, and with a
   black eye, and I remember people noticing me, looking at my face,
   glancing at me with inquisitive looks that I read as, "you poor
   thing..." "you're hurt..." "who hurt you?..." "you don't deserve to be
   abused..." there were many that couldn't take their eyes off me...
   which made me want to avoid their notice and their looks of wondering
   what happened to me because I didn't know how to respond, in some ways
   their concern was touching, but it felt hard to hold and recieve from
   them, especially because I didn't know them, nor had we had any words
   exchanged, only looks.

   <p>I love your posts Kelly! They always make me think a lot and long
   after I've turned off the computer. :)

   <p>Hi Kelly... Monica... last comment... through her blog directed me
   here!!

   <p>What a beautiful post you have touched my heart deeply.. I love to
   look at people too.. not staring.. though.. I find them fascinating..
   I love them actually.. each person is special in some way...

   <p>I hope God gives you a deeper and more compassionate heart so that
   somehow you can reach out with the love and depth you obviously have
   inside and can go that extra mile..

   <p>You have a gift to notice these people and I believe God could give
   you what you needed to make that connection to these people...

   <p>God knows they need people like you..

   <p>Love to you from Sharon

   <p>Blessed Kelly,

   <p>Ive never been here before, I found this place through another
   journal. Id like to know you. It takes a certain kind of beautiful
   person to notice the unnoticables. I hope you stop by my journal
   sometime, or email. But Ill be back agian if its ok. I always love new
   people! My name is yanisin, and I am 20 yrs old, in case u wanted to
   know a little snippit about lil' ol' me. God bless you. :)

   <p>I have been very touched by your post. It is truly thought-provoking.
   I used to notice people more than I do now. I think I need to notice
   more and then ACT on what I notice. What an example that would set for
   my son. Thanks for making me think.

   <p>sherry. i'm glad. thank you. i definitely need to act more, and maybe
   notice more for the right reasons. but i don't necessarily know what
   that would look like...but it's worth trying to figure out.
