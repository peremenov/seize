<h>Abstract

   <p>This is the first of a three-part series,made out of the original
   (excellent) paperwritten by Paolo Zanellain 1990. I hope that it can
   serve future Computoriansto write "IT at CERN: its birth, its life
   ..."

   <h>1. INTRODUCTION

   <p>The origins of computing machinery can be traced back to 3000years ago
   when the Chinese introduced a primitive form of abacus,or 300 years
   ago when Schickard, Pascal and Leibniz invented thefirst arithmetic
   machines. For us at CERN it all started 30 yearsago when one of the
   first electronic digital computers, a hugeFerranti Mercury, was
   installed. It was the beginning of a successstory which has changed
   the way to do physics and, as a matter offact, to do any work at all
   in the Laboratory.

   <p>The story goes on and the changes brought in by the newinformation
   technologies continue to affect us at an astonishingrate. Those who
   witnessed the beginning of the information era wereconscious of the
   potential impact of those mar marvellous machineson Physics as well as
   on Society, but they could hardly imaginewhat was to come. In
   retrospect, we can say that the 30 years whichseparate us from the
   days of those first generation machines, havebeen years of struggle,
   of sweat and tea tears, of doubt and ofpainful reappraisal, but also
   years of discovery, of excitement, ofachievement and of pride to the
   actors in this uniqueadventure.

   <p>Of those 30 CERN years, I missed only the first three. I did notmiss,
   however, the joys of programming first generation machines,although in
   a different environment. Actually, when I joined CERNearly in 1962,
   the only machines around were still made out ofvacuum tubes. I am,
   therefore, rather well placed to tell mypersonal account of the what,
   why and how of the evolutionof automatic computing at CERN.

   <p>I shall not even attempt to be exhaustive, let alone objective.I shall
   tell the story as I saw it, or rather as I lived it.Instead of
   compressing 262800 hours into 1, I shall select andreport only those
   events which, in my opinion, are either realmilestones or make an
   interesting story, and I shall follow themthrough to their
   consequences, even if this means breaking thestrict chronological
   order. The basic features of the largehigh-performance systems which
   have played a major role in the CERNComputer Center are listed in
   Appendix1.

   <h>2. THE BIG BANG

   <p>It took six days for God to build the Universe and a little overtwo
   years for the Ferranti engineers to produce our Mercury,a large
   assembly of complex circuitry hidden inside a row ofaustere cabinets,
   making few concessions ons to people's curiosity.At about the same
   time the PS was built in five years and today onecan build
   accelerators 1000 times more powerful, always in aboutfive years. The
   Mercury was 1000 times less powerful (16.6 kHz)than a modern personal
   computer which is now mass-produced byrobotized assembly lines at the
   rate of 2 or 3 per minute!

   <p>The purchasing contract was signed on the 25th of May, 1956
   andstipulated that the machine with 1024 40-bit words of fast [ 120
   microsec to read/write one word from theaccumulator] core store and a
   slow [8.75 mseclatency] drum store having a total capacity of
   16384words of 40 binary digits, would be shipped to CERN in
   earlyFebruary 1957 and installation shall be completed by 1st
   May,1957.... The details of the progress of manufacture will
   besubmitted at intervals of one month. The Mercury had a clockcycle of
   60 microsec. It took 180 microsec to add and 300 microsecto multiply
   two long words of 40 bits. It had floating pointarithmetic. Division,
   however, had to be programmed. It isinteresting to note the absence of
   the word software fromthe contract, the only relevant mention being:
   any programs andsub-routines which Ferranti will prepare will be made
   available toCERN free of charge. Unbundling and licensing were
   unknownin the 50's.

   <p>The computer actually arrived during the summer of 1958and passed the
   acceptance tests in October of that year. Followingits successful
   introduction, a thick file of orders revealed theurgent need for spare
   valves and of tape bins (a criticaldevice in those days of punched
   paper tape input/output!).

   <p>At the end of 1958, the availability of a programming languagecalled
   Autocode, attracted the first users tothe computer centre and marked
   the beginning of the 30 years ofcomputing covered by this paper. It is
   interesting to note that thefirst Mercury Autocode compiler was
   written in 1956(by R. A. Brooker), two years before the appearance of
   the firstFORTRAN compiler! It had many features which appeared laterin
   FORTRAN. Due to memory limitations, variable names wererestricted to a
   single alphabetic character (5-bit Ferranti code).It is worth noting
   that in the mid 50's the European computerindustry was still
   competitive. As far as competence, innovativeideas and successful
   products are concerned, European companieslike Ferranti, English
   Electric and Elliott in England, Telefunken in Germany andBull in
   France had little to envy their Americancompetitors (e.g.
   ERA/Remington Rand, NCR, IBM). Thesize and the drive of the American
   market were, however, going tomake the difference quite rapidly in the
   60's.

   <p>The reasons behind the decision to acquire a Mercury weretechnical,
   political and financial. Technically the Mercury wasdefinitely one of
   the most advanced machines around. It wasconsidered superior to the
   Ferranti Pegasus, to the Elliott 404, tothe English Electric 'Deuce',
   to the Bull 'Gamma 311' and todrum-type machines like the IBM 650.
   Ferranti was set up to producea dozen units and CERN was going to get
   serial number 6. The factthat Harwell and Saclay had ordered Mercury's
   was given a certainweight. CERN had no experience in electronic
   digital computers andit was better to be part of a club of users. As
   to the price (onemillion Swiss Francs), it was five times cheaper than
   equivalentAmerican machines like the ERA 1101.

   <p>Discussions went on for several months at CERN in 1955 and
   1956.External experts were involved. Fifteen years after Konrad
   Zuse'srelay-based Z3 considered by many as the first general
   purposecomputer, ten years after the electronic ENIAC, and six years
   afterMaurice Wilkes' EDSAC, people were still debating on the virtues
   ofbinary versus decimal machines, on the importance of floating
   pointarithmetic, on the size of words (the Z3 had 22-bit and the
   EDSAC32-bit words; the ENIAC was a decimal machine with 10
   digitswords. The size of central memory was 64 words for the Z3, 2n
   forthe ENIAC and 512 for the EDSAQ, and on the best way to input
   andoutput data (punched film, 5-7-8 channels papertape, or
   cards).Practical problems had to do with the unreliability of
   thehardware, the organization of the operations and the recruitment
   ofexperts. Obsolescence was already a problem.

   <p>CERN decided that the machine should be purely binary, that32-bit
   words were too short, and that the speed should be as highas possible
   (in particular multiplication time should be under amillisecond). It
   also concluded that the speed and size ofmemory were very important
   (several tens of thousands of binarydigits were a clear necessity),
   while the availability offloating point hardware was considered a very
   desirable,although not quite indispensable, feature of a
   scientificcomputer. But what really makes it worthwhile to have
   amachine, is the enthusiasm for carrying out the most
   difficultcomputations, as an American physicist put it in a
   letterdescribing his experience with a digital computer or 'thecourage
   to go ahead and solve problems which would have seemed toodifficult to
   do otherwise.'

   <p>The computers of that time had colorful names like ILLIAC at
   theUniversity of Illinois, AVIDAC at Argonne, MANIAC, UNIVAC,
   etc...Most of them were prototypes. Everything was very
   muchexperimental. The operations arrangements at the ILLIAC
   weredescribed as follows: 'The user deposits his punched paper tapein
   a box with instructions or the operator. The operator takesthese
   tapes, and inserts them in the machine in turn. If the codeis correct,
   the machine delivers the answers and these may bepicked up by the user
   the next morning. If there are errors in thecode, the operator carries
   out the test routines requested and theresults of these tests are
   deposited so that these may be reviewedby the user the next morning.
   Thus, the whole operation of themachine becomes a fairly automatic
   affair'. This was more orless the style adopted for our operations
   thirty years ago.

   <p>One of the first applications at CERN was the analysis of thepapertape
   produced by the Instruments for the Evaluation ofPhotographs (IEPs),
   used to scan and measure bubble chamber film.The first reports convey
   a certain deception due to the slow taperead/write speed. Since
   everything had to go through theaccumulator, the CPU was blocked
   during I/0. It was immediatelyclear that there was a big mismatch
   between the power of thecomputing engine and its input/output
   capability.

   <p>After some struggling with faulty tubes, tape bins,
   machineinstructions and Autocode, people with lots of datadiscovered
   the existence of an IBM 704 in Paris, which offeredsignificant
   advantages such as magnetic tape units, cardreaders, line printers and
   FORTRAN! FORTRAN II allowed6-characters variable names and, most
   important, it simplified theexchange of programs with Berkeley and
   Brookhaven. The 1959 CERNAnnual Report indicated already that as the
   needsincrease, it will be necessary to envisage the replacement of
   theMercury by a more powerful system. It was also quickly realizedthat
   these so-called electronic brains required quite a lot ofhuman effort
   to be effectively exploited. Hence the proposal todouble in 1960 the
   computer center staff (from 10 to 20).

   <p>So, by the end of the 50's, the fundamental forces, sociologicaland
   technological, characteristic of every computer service, hadbeen
   discovered, including the illusion that upgrading theresources would
   solve all the problems and achieve the ultimategoal, i.e. make the
   users happy!

   <h>3. THE LESSONS OF THE EARLY 60'S

   <p>The next big news was the arrival of the IBM 709, animproved version
   of the 704, in January 1961. It was still a clumsyvacuum tube machine
   but it featured FORTRAN and all those fancyperipherals apt to improve
   the quality of life.

   <p>The word length was 36 bits, the characters became 6-bit BCD,and the
   core memory size jumped to 32K. The CPU was 4-5 timesfaster than that
   of the Mercury. However, to compile a typicalFORTRAN program could
   take several minutes! Tape bins made wayfor card trays. Magnetic tape
   units read and wrote at 75 ips on 7tracks and the density was 200 bpi.
   Peripherals were attached viatheir controllers to data channels. It
   was a significant advance inthat it allowed as many as six peripheral
   devices to access corememory buffers while the CPU performed other
   work. Anotherimportant device which came with the 709 was the
   so-called DirectData Connection, allowing for direct transmission of
   data fromexternal equipment to memory via a channel. The speed was
   notridiculous: in principle up to 1 Megabit/sec. The 709 was
   alsoequipped with one of the first interrupt systems.

   <p>The bad news was still the poor reliability, although theprogress was
   already quite substantial. Unscheduled maintenancerepresented 11% of
   the total time. Scheduled maintenance took awaya time slice of similar
   size. So the down-time of the 709 comparednot too unfavorably with the
   up time of the very first electroniccomputers.... The on-line card
   reader and the printer did, however,slow down the operations
   considerably. After one year of experienceCERN added a small IBM 1401,
   in order to speed up the input/output,the job sequencing and the
   operations. The concept of SPOOLing(Simultaneous Peripheral Operation
   On-Line) with its 1/0 files(virtual reader/printer) has its origins in
   those days. Programmingfor the 709 was considered a difficult activity
   to be left to thespecialists who could understand and keep up-to-date
   with the newtechniques and the operating conventions. The machine was
   anexpensive resource which had to be used efficiently. To give anidea,
   the list price was in the region of ten millions francs(1960 Swiss
   francs!). In those days a magnetic tape cost 60 $(some 260 SF!). It
   was at that time that the first inescapablecommittees appeared, e.g.
   Computer Scheduling Committee,Computer Users Advisory Committee and
   the Data Handling PolicyGroup.

   <p>The Mercury had still its faithful users but suffered from thechronic
   lack of modern, fast peripherals. In 1962, as part of alifting
   operation, it was enhanced by the connection of an Ampextape unit,
   compatible with IBM specifications and operatingat 3333 characters per
   second (over 3 times the speed of thefastest paper tape reader and
   some 20 times faster than a tapepunch). Also, two papertape-to-card
   converters were installed toease the transfer of data from the Mercury
   to the 709. By theend of 1962 it was possible to read the paper tape
   from IEPs intothe Mercury, give it a first processing pass, write the
   resultson magnetic tape and input it onto the IBM 709 for
   furtheranalysis. The first application packages appeared at that
   time,e.g. THRESH and GRIND used for the geometrical reconstruction
   andkinematic analysis of bubble chamber events. It is amusing to
   notethat, in spite of the growing workload and the frantic
   developmentof codes, the machines were normally switched off at
   weekends. Butthe practice of 24 hours/day, 7-days/week service was
   around thecorner. It is also in interesting to realize that things
   like theconnection of the Ampex tape unit to the Mercury were
   entirelydesigned and implemented on site.

   <p>The next problem was how to use all those Autocodeprograms on the 709.
   One just wrote an Autocodecompiler for the 709. The difficulties of
   developing software weresoon to be learned. The first Conference
   recognizing the existenceof a software crisis was held in Munich in
   1968. Why is softwarealways late and unreliable? People working today
   with modern CASE(Computer Assisted Software Engineering) or OOP
   (Object OrientedProgramming) tools are still trying to solve the
   problem. But theanswer in those days was: better programming
   languages.

   <p>CERN FORTRAN was defined to ensure compatibility with
   otherlaboratories and facilitate portability of codes. It was
   felt,however, that FORTRAN was used mainly for historical reasonsand
   new, more powerful languages would be needed to fully exploitthe
   potential of the electronic computer. As we all know, CERN wasnot
   affected by, or it missed completely, the language explosionwhich
   started in the early 60's. ALGOL, Lisp, PL/I, PASCAL, ModulaII, ADA,
   C, PROLOG, etc... did not raise above the level ofminority cultures.
   FORTRAN evolved through its versions II, IV, 66,77, 8X, and it still
   dominates the CERN programming landscape.

   <p>It took some time to saturate the 709, but it was already clearthat
   young physicists were becoming addicted. It was at that timethat the
   first embryonic Operating System appeared under the nameof FORTRAN
   Monitor System. Many other important events occurredin the early 60's,
   such as the connection of computers on-line tofilm measuring devices
   including the very fast automatic flyingspot digitizers (HPD, Luciole,
   etc..) forerunners of the modernimage digitizers and the first
   attempts to connect computersdirectly to experimental equipment
   (on-line experiments). The IBM709 was operated on-line to an HPD to
   measure both bubble and sparkchamber films. In September 1963 the 709
   was replaced by a 7090, a transistorized version of the same machine,
   about fourtimes more powerful.

   <p>It was at that time that the investments and the efforts startedto pay
   off. Over 300 000 frames of spark chamber film wereautomatically
   scanned and measured in record time using an HPDFlying Spot Digitizer
   on-line to the 7090. At about the same timecomputers were connected
   on-line to experiments to monitor theequipment and to collect digital
   data from the first filmlessdetectors (e.g. sonic spark chambers) onto
   magnetic tape. The firstsuccessful demonstrations with fully auto
   automatic digital patternrecognition showed that computers could be
   programmed to replaceslow human operators in a variety of tasks.
   Stories about computersdoing things faster, better and more reliably
   than human beings gotaround producing the usual mixture re of
   emotional reactions. In1970 the European Physics Society held a
   Conference at CERN on the'Impact of Computers on Physics' and I
   remember the reassuringstatement of an eminent physicist that 'so far
   computers have notsignificantly contributed to any discovery'. It was
   going to takeanother decade to see the HEP community wholeheartedly
   acceptingthe computer as a critical component of their research
   andadmitting it to their current technological foundation trilogy:
   accelerators, detectors and computers.

   <p>1970 was also the year when the 'CERN Computing and DataHandling
   School' was launched to educate young physicists andstimulate the
   sharing of computing experience between high-energyphysicists and
   computer scientists. It turned out to be anexcellent idea. The School
   is still alive and well, fulfilling aclear need. As to the
   cross-fertilization across thephysics/computer science boundary, it
   has developed into an idealpartnership.

   <p>Actually the two disciplines have influenced each other from thevery
   beginning. It was the physicist Bruno Rossi who built thefirst logic
   circuits which then were developed into computerhardware, and
   physicists have always been among the mostdemanding consumers of
   computer cycles. Enrico Fermi, when asked inthe early fifties which
   research project would he recommend to theyoung Italian physicists,
   told them to design and build a computer.Indeed, physics research
   could not have become what it is withoutthe computer, and conversely,
   the development of the computer hasbeen deeply influenced by the needs
   and vision of basicresearch.

   <p>The study of the fundamental properties of elementary matterinvolves
   the frontiers of human knowledge and pushes the technologyto the limit
   of what is possible. Computer scientists have beenplaying with models
   and formalisms, architectures and languages,inventing tools and
   methodologies of a rather theoretical natureand they have been
   sometimes accused of developing generalsolutions in search of specific
   problems. When a dense problemspace meets a rich solution space some
   good news can beexpected... Evidence of synergistic effects has been
   accumulatingever since the beginning of the information era.
   High-energyphysics and information technology are among those
   disciplineswhich, in the second half of our century, have shown the
   mostimpressive advances.

                            <h>Appendix 1 (part 1)

   <p>All the major computers having served in the CERN ComputerCentre in
   the period 1958-1988 are listed in chronological order,together with
   some configuration details and their characteristicfeatures.

   <h>FERRANTI 'Mercury' [1958-1965]

   <p>First generation vacuum tube machine (60 microsec clockcycle, 2 cycles
   to load or store, 3 cycles to add and 5 cycles tomultiply 40 bit
   longwords, no hardware division) with magnetic corestorage (1024
   40-bit words, 120 microsec access time). Mercury'sprocessor had
   floating point arithmetic and a B-Register (indexregister). Magnetic
   drum auxiliary storage (16 Kwords of 40 bits,8.75 msec average
   latency, 64 longwords transferred perrevolution). Paper tape I/0. Two
   Ampex magtape units added in 1962.Autocode compiler. At the end of its
   career it wasconnected on-line to an experiment (Missing Mass
   Spectrometer). In1966 the Mercury was shipped to Poland as a gift to
   the Academy ofMining and Metallurgy at Cracow.

   <h>IBM 709 [1961-1963]

   <p>Vacuum tube machine (12 microsec clock cycle, 2 cycles toadd and 15 on
   average to multiply 36 bit integers, hardwireddivision and floating
   point arithmetic, index registers) with corestorage (32 Kwords of 36
   bits, 24 microsec access time). Cardreader (250 cpm) and card punch
   (100 cpm). Line printer. Magtapeunits (7 tracks, 75 ips, 200 bpi).
   Introduction of the DataChannel. FORTRAN compiler. FORTRAN Monitor
   System.

   <h>IBM 7090 [1963-1965]

   <p>Transistorized second-generation machine ( 2.18 microsecclock cycle)
   with core storage (32 Kwords of 36 bits, 4.36 microsecaccess time).
   Card 1/0, Tape units (7 tracks, 112.5 ips, 200/556bpi). Eight Data
   Channels. Interrupt System. FORTRAN compiler.Basic Monitor Operating
   System (IBSYS). Connected on-line to FlyingSpot Digitizers (HPD and
   Luciole) to measure bubble and sparkchamber films.

   <h>CDC 6600 [1965-1975]

   <p>Serial Number 3 (pre-production series machine). Transistormachine
   designed by Seymour Cray and very compact for its time. CPUclock cycle
   100 nsec. Core memory: 128 Kwords of 60 bits.Memory access 1 microsec,
   but independent memory banks allowed forup to one access per clock
   cycle. Instruction prefetch. Tenoverlapping functional units. Ten
   autonomous peripheral processorunits (PPU's) each with 4K of 12-bit
   words core memory. Huge disksover one meter in diameter holding 500
   million bits. Tape Units(half inch tape, 7 tracks, 200, 556 and 800
   bpi, and one inch tape,14 tracks, 800 bpi). High-speed card reader
   (1200 cpm).

   <p>First multi-programmed machine in the Computer Centre. However,SIPROS
   multiprogramming operating system was abandoned by ControlData. Basic
   SIPROS operating system had to be made at CERN. ThenChippewa OS (COS)
   was installed. It evolved to SCOPE which waseventually used after
   adapting it to CERN needs. This resulted in anon-trivial amount of
   changes, thus deserving the renaming to CERNSCOPE. The 6600 was
   connected to various FSD systems and to twoon-line computers, the
   SDS920 and the IBM 1800, via CERN-made datalinks. In terms of
   processing capacity the 6600 was about threequarters of a CERN unit or
   ten times the 7090.

   <p>The change-over from the IBM 7090 was planned to take threemonths
   starting in January 1965. Major engineering overhauls had tobe done
   instead during the first few years and ended up in atwo-months
   shut-down in 1968 in order to modify the 6600 toincorporate logic and
   packaging improvements which had beenintroduced in the production
   machines. During this long period ofstruggling with hardware
   instabilities and software development andchanges, computing work was
   done partly by sending jobs to outsidecomputers and partly by
   processing data on a CDC 3400, and later ona 3800, temporarily made
   available at CERN by Control Data.

   <h>CDC 3800 [1966-1968]

   <p>The 3800 was a member of the 3000 series CDC family ofcomputers,
   incompatible with the 6000 series machines. Moreconventional than the
   6600, the 3800 had a 48-bit architecture. Thecore memory (64 Kwords)
   was replaced by a faster one (800 nsec)during its staying at CERN.
   This machine was eventually acquired bythe State of Geneva and
   installed at the local University. At CERNit was replaced by a CDC
   6400. It is worth noting that CERNacquired other machines of the 3000
   s series, e.g. a 3100 for theFOCUS project offering semi-interactive
   facilities and quicksampling of experimental data at the central
   computers, and a 3200for interactive graphics applications.
