                     <h>Keeping an Eye on Central America

 <p>NASA-supported researchers have developed software anyone can use to fly,
video game-style, over Central America and survey its current environmental
                                conditions.

   <p>April 23, 2004:  Flying over the lush, mountainous landscape of
   Central America, a local environmental official points out plumes of
   smoke where "slash and burn" agriculture is destroying hundreds of
   acres of rain forest. In the distance, dark-tinted waters of a red
   tide nearing coastal fishing villages are clearly visible from this
   altitude. He points to a silt-filled river snaking through the forest
   below -- a symptom of soil erosion caused by unsustainable farming
   practices upstream, he explains.

   <p>The view evokes a kind of intuitive understanding of these
   environmental concerns that words alone can not provide.

   <p>Juan Mario Dary, the environmental minister of Guatemala, plans to
   give such an aerial tour of Central America this weekend. Only he
   won't actually be in a plane. In fact, he won't be anywhere near
   Central America. He'll be in Tokyo, Japan, at the second annual Earth
   Observation Summit.

   <p>The tour Dary plans to give will be a virtual flight over a
   computer-generated, 3-dimensional landscape -- something like a
   "flight simulator" video game. The view through the window, though, is
   reality. It's based on real satellite and geographic data, offering a
   "big picture" view of how humans are affecting the rich diversity of
   wildlife in the region.

   <p>"In some ways, it's better than the real thing," says Daniel Irwin, a
   research scientist at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. "The user
   can choose which 'layers' of the data they want to see, some of which
   aren't obvious from a real plane: conservation park boundaries, small
   village locations, ecosystem types, and endangered species habitats,
   just to name a few."

   <p>This virtual landscape software is one of many new tools that Irwin
   and others are developing as part of an international project called
   SIAM-SERVIR, an acronym in Spanish meaning "Mesoamerican System of
   Environmental Information -- Regional System of Monitoring and
   Visualization."

   <p>Through a coordinated effort between the seven countries of Central
   America, NASA, the World Bank, the U.S. Agency for International
   Development (USAID), and others, SIAM-SERVIR is creating an
   easy-to-use Web portal to environmental data for the entire region.
   The portal (http://servir.nsstc.nasa.gov) is online now, though it is
   still incomplete. The importance of having daily wildfire data
   available during the spring fire season convinced them to pre-release
   the site, Irwin says. It will be finished later this year.

   <p>Above: A scene from the flyby. False colors in this satellite image of
   Lake Nicaragua represent types of land cover: green is forest, while
   purple, red, and pink represent specific combinations of agriculture,
   bare soil, and urban areas. This perspective view was created using
   software from Skyline Software Systems.

   <p>Daily, near real-time updates to the portal are based on NASA
   satellite data, acquired and processed automatically. Web surfers--
   whether students, scientists, or Central American politicians -- can
   view the information in a variety of ways: interactive 2-dimensional
   maps, "fly throughs" of a 3D virtual landscape, or they can download a
   specific slice of the raw data to do their own analysis.

   <p>"This project will be ending a distinctive feature of Central America,
   where environmental information has always been jealously guarded by
   institutions or people. Now instead we hope that the information will
   flow freely," says Rafael Guillen, Irwin's primary technical
   collaborator in Central America and an expert in Geographic
   Information Systems mapping software (GIS).

   of SIAM-SERVER. [Larger image]

   <p>Anything that can be plotted on a map can be integrated into the
   master database: historic geographic records, modern road maps,
   satellite spectral data from Landsat and MODIS (MODerate-resolution
   Imaging Spectroradiometer), or wildlife habitat data from traditional
   fieldwork. Irwin, Guillen and colleagues hope that all this
   information, freely available and easy to understand, will help
   Central Americans make better decisions about the region's beleaguered
   natural resources.

   <p>In July, construction will begin on a central data storage facility in
   Panama. In addition to being the information warehouse for the
   project, the Panama facility will be a kind of "situation room" -- a
   "mission control" for monitoring the health and condition of rain
   forests, croplands, rivers, and coastal waters throughout Central
   America. USAID is funding the development of this facility, as well as
   six smaller facilities in each of the other Central American
   countries: Belize, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, and El
   Salvador. These smaller national centers will be staffed by experts
   with direct access to the central database for helping address the
   environmental issues in their own countries.
   <p>Central America is a region with a great richness and diversity of
   tropical wildlife: though it only constitutes roughly 1% of the
   planet's surface, the region is home to about 7% of all land-dwelling
   species. The region is also home to a rapidly growing and widely
   impoverished human population. Serving the needs of the people without
   bankrupting the natural resources on which they depend is an enormous
   challenge to political decision makers.

  <p>Right: Much of Central America's rich biodiversity in is
   being destroyed by "slash and burn" agriculture. This photo was taken
   in Pet√©n, Guatemala, by Daniel Irwin.
   <p>It was local decision makers who came up with the idea for this
   Web-portal project, explains Irwin. The impetus came from an
   intergovernmental organization called CCAD (a Spanish acronym meaning
   "Central American Commission of Environment and Development"), which
   combines and coordinates the efforts of the seven Central American
   countries' ministries of the environment. Regional treaties charge the
   CCAD with the task of promoting environmental protection and
   sustainable development throughout the region. This new Web portal is
   one tool they sought to help them in their work.

   <p>"We're not telling the Central Americans what needs to be done," says
   Irwin. "Rather we're trying to listen and develop products and tools
   based on their needs. It is a demand-driven process."

   <p>Once development of the system is finished and local experts have been
   sufficiently trained, control and operation of the system will be
   turned over to the local environmental authorities, though NASA will
   remain available to them for technical support.

   <p>Meanwhile, anyone with an Internet connection can visit. At the portal
   you can see plumes from fires and watch rain clouds drift by.
   Eventually, when the site is complete, you can hop aboard a virtual
   plane and fly up and down the long Central American coast--just like a
   high-level environmental minister. As Irwin says, in some ways, it's
   better than the real thing.
