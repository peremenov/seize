<h>      Time, economy leave Moscow's St. Basil's in sorry condition

<p>      MOSCOW -- It's still one of the world's great wonders, a riot of 
      architectural panache and color that's 4-1/2 centuries old and still halts 
      awed first-time viewers in their tracks.
<p>      But up close, St. Basil's Cathedral is downright dilapidated, the Mir 
      space station of churches. While cranes and repair crews in every 
      direction signal the Moscow renaissance, Russia's most recognizable 
      landmark stands comparatively ignored on Red Square amid the boom.
<p>      The most glorious symbol of old Moscow is getting short shrift in the rush 
      to construct malls, office towers, stadiums and especially the huge Christ 
      the Savior Cathedral just upriver.
<p>      "Everyone loves us, everyone comes to us, but nobody needs us," laments 
      St. Basil's chief curator, Lyubov Uspenskaya, whose pleas for public or 
      private funds to fix the crumbling bricks and decrepit interior have 
      fallen on deaf ears. "The state promises a lot, but what we actually 
      receive is only a small percentage of that."
<p>      Few would dispute that the cash-strapped Russian government should pay its 
      pensioners, teachers and state workers first.
<p>      But authorities who manage to find or raise money for other renovation 
      projects clearly view St. Basil's as a low priority, perhaps because no 
      one stands to get credit or profit from a costly restoration of those 
      famous pineapple and onion domes.
<p>      Asked about the prospects for a fix up, Culture Ministry spokeswoman Vera 
      Lebedeva had a curt, no-nonsense reply: "Unfortunately, the government has 
      no money (for St. Basil's), and has no plans to fully restore it this 
      year."
<p>      The story of St. Basil's is as familiar to Russians as the multicolored 
      cupolas are to people worldwide through photographs, children's books or 
      as backdrops for TV newscasts from Moscow.
<p>      Ivan the Terrible had it built just outside the Kremlin walls in 1552 to 
      honor Russia's victory over the Tatars at Kazan. Formally named the 
      Cathedral of the Intercession, it was nicknamed St. Basil's after a holy 
      man who was buried in the previous cathedral that stood on the site.
<p>      Living up to his own moniker, Ivan -- according to legend -- had the 
      architects blinded so they could never build anything more beautiful.
<p>      Despite surviving decades of atheist rule and the wrecking balls that 
      bashed in countless churches under Stalin, the cathedral's bells have long 
      been silent and priests no longer preside at what is now a government 
      museum.
<p>      Streams of tourists come to have photos snapped out front. But most don't 
      go in, dissuaded if not by the entrance fee (up to 26 rubles, or about 
      $4.30), than by the less-than-welcoming appearance.
<p>      "It's a beautiful masterpiece," said Fazil Yoosuf, a visitor from Sri 
      Lanka, gazing at the cathedral recently. "But it's in pretty bad condition 
      in some places. It's clearly neglected."
<p>      Under fading domes and scarred, crumbling bricks, the front entranceway, 
      its white and red stripes faded almost beyond recognition, has the look of 
      a bankrupt barbershop.
<p>      In the labyrinthine interior, where 10 small chapels lie under the 
      cupolas, reconstruction work that officials say has been under way 
      constantly since 1923 is proceeding at a glacial pace.
<p>      Glittering icons and bright wall paintings have been restored in some 
      chapels. But overall, the famous cathedral has the ambience of an old 
barn.
<p>      The budget apparently doesn't cover the heating bill, so museum employees 
      must work bundled up against the winter chill.
<p>      The domes were last repainted when Moscow was host for the 1980 Summer 
      Olympics. Officials say it's well past time for St. Basil's to have a true 
      face lift: domes and gold-plating work repainted along with some frescoes 
      and ornaments, basement rebuilt, runoff pipes and pavement redone.
<p>      And that's just the outside. Uspenskaya estimates exterior renovation 
      costs alone at $3 million. But sponsors can't be found.
<p>      St. Basil's neglect is in striking contrast to the nearby Christ the 
      Savior Cathedral, a pet project of Moscow's powerful mayor, Yuri Luzhkov.
<p>      Legions of workers have swarmed over that site for two years, and city 
      authorities and the Russian Orthodox Church aggressively solicited 
      donations via billboards, subway ads and TV commercials to help foot the 
      reported $250 million tab.
<p>      "If not for the Cathedral of Christ the Savior, we would have been getting 
      money," Uspenskaya said.
<p>      Another problem, she noted with irony, is that St. Basil's is not 
      collapsing, which is the quickest way to get attention and money.
<p>      "We hope that sometime we'll get what we need, maybe when the situation in 
      the country becomes better," the curator said. "Perhaps there are more 
      urgent things to do now."
