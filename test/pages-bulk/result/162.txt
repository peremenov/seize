<h>   Born gay? How biology may drive orientation

<h>   By Sandi Doughton

<h>   Seattle Times science reporter

<p>    As the culture wars rage over gay rights, a flock of sheep at Oregon
   State University may help answer a key question behind the
   controversy: Is homosexuality a matter of choice or biology?

<p>   The Corvallis herd includes a group of rams that scientists delicately
   refer to as "male-oriented." These animals consistently ignore females
   and bestow all their amorous attentions on members of their own sex.

<p>   Researcher Charles Roselli says a decade of study suggests sexual
   orientation is largely hard-wired into the sheep's brains before
   birth. Now, he's trying to figure out how that happens, zeroing in on
   genes and hormones. In a bold test of his ideas, he hopes to engineer
   the birth of gay rams by altering conditions in the womb.

<p>   Sheep aren't people, but the Oregon work adds to a growing body of
   research that bolsters biological explanations for sexual orientation
   across species -- including humans.

<p>   Despite those scientific findings, some religious groups say
   homosexuality is a lifestyle that can be treated, if not prevented.
   One such group, the conservative Christian organization Focus on the
   Family, is sponsoring a one-day conference in Bothell Saturday.

<p>   The social and political implications of the research are impossible
   to ignore, leading to unease on both sides of the gay-rights debate.
   If science proves homosexuality is innate, is there any basis to deny
   gays equal treatment -- including the right to marry? But if
   scientists unravel the roots of sexual orientation, will it some day
   be possible to "fix" people who don't fit the norms or abort fetuses
   likely to be born gay?

<h>   Volunteers needed

<p>   Researchers will recruit gay men with gay brothers in Seattle this
   summer to participate in a national study on the genetics of sexual
   orientation. Scientists will analyze blood samples from 1,000 pairs of
   gay brothers across the country. Representatives will be at the
   Seattle Pride Festival June 25-26.

<p>   More information on the five-year study is available at
   www.gaybros.com

<p>   Much of the cutting-edge research is being conducted in other
   countries, because the political pressure cooker in the United States
   makes it difficult for scientists to get money, said Brian Mustanski,
   who juggles studies of the genetics of homosexuality with his main
   work on HIV prevention at the University of Illinois, Chicago.

<p>   But controversy can't obscure the facts, he said.

<p>   "It's pretty definitive that biological factors play a role in
   determining a person's sexual orientation."

<p>   Austrian scientists reported this month that switching a single gene
   was enough to make female fruit flies rebuff males and attempt to mate
   with other females. Swedish researchers recently found the sexual
   center of gay men's brains lit up when they sniffed a pheromone-like
   chemical from men's sweat, but didn't respond to a chemical from
   women.

<p>   And last fall, Italian scientists offered a possible explanation for
   the persistence of gay genes -- even though evolution tends to weed
   out traits that discourage reproduction. The team from the University
   of Padua found that mothers and aunts of gay men had more offspring
   than female relatives of heterosexuals, suggesting genes that
   influence homosexuality in men may increase fertility in females.

<p>   That the evidence comes from such disparate directions leads
   scientists to suspect several different biological pathways may lead
   to homosexuality. Both genes and hormones appear to be important. Nor
   do researchers discount the possibility that social factors may play a
   role.

<p>   "I tend not to be a nature-versus-nurture kind of dichotomist," said
   Roselli, of the Oregon Health & Science University School of Medicine
   in Portland. "I think there's probably a very complex interaction
   that's going on between both biology and the environment that is
   involved in determining these types of behaviors."

<h>   "Shy breeders"

<l>   Gay sheep may show

<l>   whether neurohormones

<l>   fix sexual identity

<p>   Though they don't talk about it much, ranchers have long known that
   about 8 percent of rams never father offspring because they only have
   eyes for other males. Australian sheepherders call them "shy
   breeders," Roselli said.

<p>   Upbringing doesn't seem to make a difference. Domestication and
   captivity aren't responsible, because rams with same-sex proclivities
   occur in the wild.

<p>   Roselli's rams come from the U.S. Sheep Experiment Station in eastern
   Idaho, where federal researchers keep a herd of 3,000 to study
   genetics, breeding and grazing impacts.

<p>   They've also been quietly looking into sexual orientation, a subject
   so touchy the lab's U.S. Department of Agriculture boss won't allow
   his staff to discuss it with the press.

<p>   Roselli and his colleagues at OSU are using the gay rams to test what
   is called the neurohormonal theory of sexual development: that
   hormones from a developing fetus fix its sexual identity by
   orchestrating brain organization. Too much or too little of these
   powerful chemicals, or shifts in timing, may lead to homosexuality,
   the theory predicts.

<p>   Last year, Roselli found that a brain region linked with sexual
   behavior was twice as big in heterosexual as homosexual rams. The
   difference seems to exist even before birth, he said. The gay rams
   also had lower brain levels of an enzyme that activates testosterone
   and promotes typical male sexual behavior.

<p>   A 1991 study reported similar differences in the brains of gay and
   heterosexual men, but the findings haven't been confirmed. Human brain
   studies are problematic for another reason: Brain structures can guide
   behavior, but behavior also can cause brain structures to enlarge or
   shrink, making it difficult to say which comes first.

<p>   So in addition to brain studies, Roselli is waiting for a group of
   lambs born last spring to reach sexual maturity. Their mothers were
   dosed with drugs to block the action of male hormones in the fetuses.
   If Roselli's hypothesis is correct, rams born of this experiment will
   be disproportionately gay.

<h>   "I just knew"

<l>   Studies indicate

<l>   sexual orientation is

<l>   set very early in life

<p>   Hormones have long been suspect in homosexuality. Doctors used to
   treat gay men with testosterone injections, until it became clear
   adult homosexuals don't have blood hormone levels that differ
   significantly from heterosexuals.

<p>   But rats, hamsters, ferrets and other lab animals flip-flop their
   sexual behavior when scientists manipulate the hormones they're
   exposed to before birth. Such experiments would be unethical in
   people, but some rare medical conditions offer human parallels.

<p>   A high proportion of girls with a disorder that causes them to secrete
   male hormones before birth grow up to be lesbian. About 40 case
   studies have shown boys who are surgically altered and raised as girls
   because of genital deformities are overwhelmingly attracted to females
   once they reach puberty -- indicating sexual orientation is determined
   very early in life and is difficult to alter.

<p>   That view is supported by a series of studies in the 1980s that found
   nearly 75 percent of young boys who dress up like girls, play with
   dolls and consistently choose stereotypical female pursuits will grow
   up to be gay. A similar, though less pronounced, pattern is found in
   girls who prefer trucks over tea sets.

<p>   Still, most gay people don't have gender-bending childhoods. As in
   heterosexuals, the majority say they became aware of their orientation
   at puberty.

<p>   "I just knew," said Seattle attorney Andrew Kamins, who is gay. "It's
   as simple as that."

<p>   Those who argue homosexuality is a choice haven't been able to dispute
   that fundamental point, said Michigan State University neuroscientist
   Marc Breedlove.

<p>   "If you're going to say people choose a sexual orientation when they
   reach puberty, you're going to have to find some people who remember
   making that choice, and there aren't any," he said. "The evidence is
   starting to look pretty good that hormones early in life influence the
   probability of who you will be attracted to 10 years later, when
   people start to get their first crushes," he said.

<h>   The hand test

<l>   Can the length of

<l>   one's fingers suggest

<l>   sexual orientation?

<p>   Breedlove found support for the neurohormonal theory by photocopying
   hands at gay street fairs.

<p>   In heterosexual women, the index and ring fingers are usually about
   the same length. In heterosexual men, the index finger is shorter, on
   average, than the ring finger. It's one of several differences between
   the sexes that seem to be set before birth, based on testosterone
   exposure.

<p>   Breedlove found lesbians' finger lengths were, on average, more like
   men's. The same holds true for other traits, like eye-blink patterns
   and inner-ear function.

<p>   "Every time you find a body marker that gives an indication of
   prenatal testosterone exposure, lesbians on average are more masculine
   than straight women," Breedlove said. "This can't be a fluke."

<p>   Patterns aren't as clear in gay men, with some hints they may be
   exposed to either less or more testosterone before birth.

<p>   All of the neurohormonal studies also leave a major puzzle unanswered:
   If hormones shape the brain and the brain directs behavior, what is
   controlling the hormone levels in the first place?

<h>   Slam-dunk proof?

<p>   Twin studies provide evidence that homosexuality runs in the family

<p>   When Vince Healy finally came out as gay, his disapproving Catholic
   family was familiar with the story. His older brother had been living
   with a man for several years. It didn't make things any easier, the
   45-year-old Ballard man recalled.

<p>   "I was very unhappy at the prospect of being gay," he said. "I kept
   thinking: I must be a late bloomer."

<p>   As the youngest of three brothers, one of whom is straight, Healy
   illustrates the two most robust findings in the science of
   homosexuality: It runs in families, and the number of older brothers a
   man has can increase his chances of being gay.

<p>   About 3 percent of American men and 1.5 percent of women describe
   themselves as gay or bisexual, according to the National Institutes of
   Health. Those percentages are three to five times higher among people
   who have a gay brother or sister.

<p>   Of course, family dynamics might be the reason, not biology.

<p>   What scientists call slam-dunk proof that genes are part of the
   equation comes from twin studies.

<p>   Genetically influenced traits are more likely to be shared among the
   closest relatives, and that pattern holds for homosexuality.

<p>   For fraternal male twins, the gay-gay concordance rate is about 22
   percent. For identical twins, it's 52 percent.

<p>   Based on those results, scientists conservatively estimate
   homosexuality is about 40 percent due to genes, said Alan Sanders,
   director of behavior genetics at Northwestern Healthcare Research
   Institute in Illinois.

<p>   But genes clearly are not the only factor, or identical twins would
   always share the same sexual orientation.

<p>   "That means there's a significant environmental contribution," said
   Sanders, who is leading a five-year, $2.5 million project for the
   National Institutes of Health to try to identify the genes involved.

<p>   Earlier research has pointed to several possible gene regions, but
   those studies were small and not definitive. With DNA from 1,000 pairs
   of gay brothers, Sanders' project will be much more powerful.

<p>   It's very unlikely to uncover a single "gay" gene, he said. As in most
   complex traits, multiple genes and environmental factors probably work
   together.

<p>   So far, scientists can only speculate how genes linked with sexual
   orientation might work. Perhaps they dictate the size of brain
   structures, which in turn regulate hormones before birth. Perhaps
   genes directly adjust prenatal hormone levels, or merely predispose
   people to a gay orientation.

<p>   Environmental factors could be exclusively biological, like chemical
   exposure or infection. One theory, backed by some evidence in rats, is
   that the chemical and hormonal milieu of the developing fetus can be
   disrupted when pregnant mothers are stressed.

<p>   Social factors may ultimately prove to play a role as well, Sanders
   said.

<p>   None of the psychosocial theories for homosexuality have panned out so
   far, including Freud's distant-father/domineering-mother dynamic.

<p>   "There have been psychological and social explanations for
   homosexuality for 100 years, and they haven't come up with anything
   concrete," said Ray Blanchard, head of Clinical Sexology Services at
   the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto.

<p>   A few studies suggest a higher rate of childhood sexual abuse in gays
   and lesbians, though there's no evidence such experiences trigger
   homosexuality, said Mustanski, the University of Illinois geneticist.

<h>   Fraternal birth order

<l>   The number of older

<l>   brothers may affect your

<l>   chances of being gay

<p>   Blanchard's work on gay brothers offers an alternative explanation so
   odd he originally dismissed it as "obviously bogus."

<p>   But when he looked into scattered reports that many gay men have older
   brothers, he was astounded. The findings now have been confirmed by
   more than a dozen studies, including several of his own: Every older
   brother a man has increases his chances of being gay. A man with four
   older brothers is three times more likely to be gay than a man with
   none. Blanchard estimates one out of every seven gay men owes his
   orientation to this "fraternal birth order" effect.

<p>   It's possible to argue for social explanations -- bullying by big
   brothers, indulgent mothers. But Blanchard believes it's biology. Gay
   males with older brothers weigh less at birth than heterosexual males
   with older brothers, hinting that something different is happening to
   them in the womb.

<p>   A possible explanation lies in the mother's immune system, which can
   be activated by cells from a male fetus.

<p>   For first sons, the effect would be slight. But subsequent boys could
   cause the immune response to ramp up until it somehow affects a baby's
   sexual orientation.

<p>   The idea is feasible, Blanchard cautioned, but still unproven.

<p>   Not all gay men have older brothers. Not all lesbians have short ring
   fingers. For some people, genes may be the dominant factor in sexual
   orientation. For others, it could be hormones. Just as sexual
   orientation spans a spectrum, scientists suspect there may be a range
   of mechanisms to explain it.

<p>   Over the next few years, scientists will begin to fit the divergent
   lines of evidence into a comprehensive picture of the way sexual
   orientation arises in both gays and heterosexuals, Mustanski predicts.

<p>   "We have these converging lines of evidence that are pointing to the
   importance of biology. Now we have to connect the dots."
