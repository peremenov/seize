<h> MAGNETOSPHERE

<h> From Observatories: Tromso, Norway

<p> The plots that are produced by Tromso offer information in a slightly
   different format. These plots are a little more complicated than the
   Kiruna plot because these scientists elected not to subtract the
   average Earth field from the data before plotting it. Like the Kiruna
   Observatory data, the Tromso Geophysical Observatory shows three
   curves in each plot - but these curves represent different quantities
   that define the magnetic field.

<p> The Blue curve is for the horizontal intensity (H). It includes the
   north-south and east-west values. The Green is for the vertical
   intensity (Z). The vertical axis on the left shows values for the
   horizontal magnetic field (blue numbers) and for the vertical magnetic
   field (green numbers). The horizontal green and blue lines indicate
   the normal or undisturbed strength of the magnetic fields.

<h> TEACHER'S NOTE

<p> A magnetic field is a vector + it has direction and magnitude (or
   size). The magnetic field around Earth is separated into a horizontal
   (H) vector and a vertical vector (Z). The horizontal vector can be
   further separated into X and Y components. The X is the north-south
   vector and the Y is the east-west part. Notice that X, Y and Z
   components of the magnetic field are vectors. They give the direction
   (X is north-south, Y is east-west, and Z is vertical) and the size of
   the magnetic field. In these graphs H is the size of the vector sum of
   the X and Y components of the magnetic field found by the Pythagorean
   Theorem - H^2 = X^2 + Y^2.

<p> The Red curve gives the value of the angle between the north
   geographic and north magnetic pole (D). The horizontal red line
   indicates the normal or undisturbed angle between north geographic and
   north magnetic pole at this location. The vertical axis on the right
   is the angle in degrees (red numbers)

<h> TEACHER'S NOTE

<p> This can be a difficult graph for students. There are two different
   scales on the left (blue and green). It is as if the green graph was
   stacked on top of the blue graph. Then the scale on the right is for
   the red line.

<p> It is easy to see just how 'stormy' things are by looking at the curve
   compared to its horizontal line (i.e. the green curve compared to the
   green line) . When there is a big difference between the current and
   average measurements, a magnetic storm is in progress in Tromso. It is
   also interesting to look at how complicated these magnetic storms can
   be with all the jumps and wiggles that happen! The sample graph above
   for the magnetic storm of May 30, 2003 shows that the strength of the
   horizontal (H) part of the magnetic field changed, the strength of the
   vertical (Z) part of the field changed and the direction of the
   horizontal part changed.

<p> When you click on the "Live Data" link for Tromso, you will see four
   plots like the above from different magnetometers operated by the
   University of Tromso. These plots are updated every 4 minutes.

<h> TEACHER'S NOTE

<p> Your students may wish to get archive data from the Tromso site. This
   data can be accessed by clicking "Back" at the bottom of the Tromso
   page and selecting "Plot Archive Data". The archive site is difficult
   to use; you should visit this site and experiment with it so you can
   assist students.
