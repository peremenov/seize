<h>                                Second Day
<h>                            Dinka-Nuer West Bank
<h>                     Peace & Reconciliation Conference 

<h>           Introduction of Dignitaries & Guests, cont. (morning)
                      and Dinka Narratives (afternoon)
                         the 28th of February, 1999

<p> Session begins with reciprocal singing, a Jieng woman leading off on
   the left side of the meeting hall. When she finished a Nuer woman took
   up another chant, all joining in. In time a male Nuer cantor (Peter
   Garkuoth) took over leadership, moving between the Nuer with a fly
   whisk.
   
<h> Telar Deng:
<p> asks for silence, calls Rv. MM to pray. 

<h> Matthew Mathiang:
<p> Let up pray. Prays in Arabic language. People in the Nuer section are
   discussing issue of distribution of pens loudly; after prayer a
   spokesman requests silence). 

<h> TD:
<p> Today we will start with the formal introduction of some participants
   and observers. It was not an oversight yesterday, but within the
   programme, to introduce the Commissioners on both sides as well as
   special guests, foreign and local. After the introduction I will give
   two opportunities, one to the Commissioner of Leer, and one to the
   Commissioner Tonj County. What will happen in the order of their
   addresses. As Tonj is hosting the meeting, Tonj will come first, and
   that of Leer will follow, as a representative of guests. I start by
   introducing to you the Commissioners of Bahr el Ghazel to you. I begin
   with Andrew Kuac, that is followed by Paul Mayom Akec of Rumbek
   County. Followed by Acuil Tito of Gogrial County.

<p> On this side I call on Joseph Juac Kuol, Commissioner of Leer County.
   We also have our observers who have come from Khartoum and I would
   like to introduce them to you. First is Gabriel Yoal. We have Samuel
   Aru Bol Man, Member of Parliament. We have Faruk Gatkuath. We have
   Stephen With Munuar. We have also been honoured to have among us
   commanders from UDSF forces. One is John Kulang Puot. We have
   commander Peter Riir . We have Gabriel Both Yol. I apologise, they
   should have come in order of seniority. Peter Parjang. We have
   alternate Commander Michael Thot Jang. I will reserve the other
   introductions of photographers, etc., for Bill Lowrey to come read
   their names to us.
   
<h> Bill Lowrey:
<p> Would those who are journalists with us please come to the front here.
   What I am going to do, is to introduce three people who have been with
   us during the chiefs' exchange, until now. Then I'll let others
   introduce themselves. Over the period of about six weeks, including
   the chiefs' exchange visit, and the lead-up to this conference we have
   had reporters from Life Magazine and the Washington Post. (Mario Maluk
   is invited forward). From Life Magazine is the writer, Janet Rightman.
   And the photographer who is working with her is Malcolm Lenton, not
   presently in the building, but you have seen him around. And from the
   Washington Post we have the photographer, Michel duCille. The other
   journalists we have with us have just arrived and will be leaving on
   the third. They will not be with us the full time, but it is very
   important that we support them as they seek to take our story to the
   whole world. I'm going to ask that each of the three of them, step
   forward and introduce themselves and their organisation:

<l> My name is Stephen Kroshaw and I'm a writer with the Independent
     Newspaper in London.

<l> My name is Thomas Sorenson. I work with the Danish Radio in
     Copenhagen.

<l> My name is Tom Pilston, a photographer with the Independent in
     London.

<p> We are grateful for these journalists who have come. They want to see
   what we are doing here and understand so that they can take your story
   to people around the world, to grasp the importance of what you are
   doing.

<p> In addition to journalists we have partners from organisations which
   are providing support for you to make this Conference possible. So I'd
   like each of the partners to come forward, introduce themselves and
   give a word of greeting from their organisations. (Jieng women begin
   singing, "give us power to triumph over evil; give us power")

<l> Thank you for that wonderful greeting from the women. My name is
     Jane Conally, Sudan representative from the Christian Aid. What's
     important is that we go forward with this. I believe CA is
     concerned to continue to support this series of meeting as well as
     the process of peace making.

<l> My name is Sarah Stuart. I work with Jane at CA, as the head of the
     Press Office, concerned with telling the concerns of our partners
     to people overseas. This is my first trip to Sudan so this is a
     very exciting time for me. I'm also writing some articles for BBC
     radio.

<l> My name is Gunter Augustini. I come from the Protestant
     Organisation for Development. I'm happy to be here with you and
     witness this important conference. I was asked to convey greetings
     from the Conference of German churches. Coming from a country that
     has brought so much suffering to many people, we are very aware
     that if you cannot solve your problems amidst peace you cannot
     solve them amidst war. We support your negotiations toward peace. I
     affirm the saying in Swahili, which says, "When the cattle join
     together the lion goes to sleep hungry." As well there is a staying
     in Ethiopia that speaks of climbing a tree to see afar. We would
     like to climb the tree with you to look into the future in the
     search for genuine peace in Sudan. We will do all we can to support
     this peace process. I can only say peace be with you and peace be
     with you all.

<l> My name is Johann Svenson and I come from the Life and Peace
     Institute. Our concern is to strengthen the initiatives of local
     people in their efforts to bring peace.

<l> My name is Justin Makuac Maniel, Peace Co-ordinator from the
     Diocese of Rumbek, working together with the NSCC. We were
     privileged to be at the beginning of this peace process, meeting at
     Loki last June. I'm pleased to announce that our Diocesan School in
     Kitale (Blessed Baghitta Formation Centre) has offered to receive
     Nuer students to study with them. This is an important advance.

<l> My name is Benaiah Odemba. I'm here to represent Catholic Relief
     Services. We consider the NSCC as one of our strongest partners in
     Sudan. We are deeply involved in this peace initiative and actually
     believe in building the local capacity for bringing about peace. As
     was said yesterday, peace can only come from the people themselves.
     We believe in peace by and for the people. We look forward to
     working with you in this important service.

<l> My name is Louie Riemen from Church of the Brethren and we have
     been partners with NCC since it first began. We are now pastors in
     the US, and our church sends very warm greetings. They ask us to
     remind you that they pray for you and they pray for peace.

<l> (Phil Riemen) It is a special joy to be back for nine weeks to help
     with this ongoing peace process.

<l> My name is Marc Nikkel. I bring greetings from the CMS as well as
     the Episcopal Church in the USA, both of which are supporters of
     this gathering. I greet you on behalf of thousands of Christians in
     America and Britain who are praying for you each day we meet.

<l> I'm Jamera Rhone. I represent Human Rights Watch which is an
     independent human rights organisation. We report on the abuses of
     all parties of all conflicts in the world, with the hope that they
     will be shamed into changing their policies and actions for the
     good of the people. I am very glad to be here with you during this
     very important gathering.

<l> My name is Malcolm Linton. I'm a photographer working for Life
     Magazine working with Janet. We're doing a story about the
     Conference and we hope it goes very well.

<h> BL:
<p> I also bring you greetings from many organisations in the US who have
   contributed funds toward this meeting. As well, there are hundreds and
   thousands of people who are in prayer with us each day of our
   meetings. 

<h> TD:
<p> Okay, we will not proceed with our programme, but I would like to make
   two remarks.

<p> First, Rumbek Diocese, and Torit Diocese and others that we have are
   not partners of this Conference. They are actually members of the
   NSCC.

<p> Secondly, we would like to recognise other organisations, such as CEAS
   and World Vision who have provided considerable support in preparation
   for this conference. As well, there are a host of other organisations
   who stand with us and support us.

<p> Now I call upon Commissioner of Tonj Country, Andrew Kuac Mayol, to
   speak to us. (Exchange of song begins, Jieng, Nuer, reciprocally)
   
<h> Andrew Kuac Mayol:
<p> Brothers and sisters in the Conference I greet you in the name of the
   Chairman of the Movement, Dr. John Garang de Mabior. I also greet you
   in the name of the people of Tonj County. It was really a concern of
   our people yesterday that our people did not see me welcoming our
   guests to this meeting house. People were saying that, as a
   commissioner of this place, I would say a word of welcome to the
   delegates in general. Let me proceed, because it would have been good
   for me to welcome yesterday so that the Commander and the Governor
   were also to hear what the Commissioner of TC was saying. But since
   that could not happen, let me proceed with a brief speech, even though
   that is not equal to the speech I had prepared yesterday.

<p> When we come to the purpose for which we have gathered, we were
   informed last September that there would be a Nuer Dinka meeting in
   Tonj County. Preparations were made then, but somewhere in the middle
   we began to doubt that the meeting might not be a success. Why were we
   doubting? We were doubting because, in the course of preparations,
   there were things that were supposed to be done. But we found that
   little or nothing had been done as far as some services had proceeded.
   Communication was not prompt from Nairobi to our end. We were
   receiving communication at some points, but at others we were lost in
   the line. There were times when we had difficulty knowing who was to
   do what, who was to prepare what. But in time we found that Mr. Mario
   Muor Muor and Tular Deng had been given certain responsibilities. I
   came to this place to speak with the chiefs asking that they get on
   with the work of construction as quickly as possible. Building got
   underway, as did the digging of a well. However, it is unfortunate
   that we have only one well, which results in the congestion which we
   have experienced. So later on when we saw Mr. Mario running back and
   forth, we were struck by words like those of Shakespeare, which said:
   ?? We knew that we would have to redouble our efforts. Buildings would
   have to be built quickly. Like these buildings were build quickly in a
   way that is inadequate to the modern way of preparation. This is why
   we have many of us sitting on the ground. So much for that, let us
   proceed.

<p> Here, let us come to the very matter for which we have gathered. It is
   good to say that we are here to record a very important event in Tonj
   county in particular. This is a rare opportunity, hardly to be
   equalled in our history. The Nuer and the Dinka are one people given
   their social and cultural backgrounds. But in the course of time we
   have been divided by the enemies of the people to fight ourselves.
   However, it is okay because all of us are aware that sons quarrel with
   their father, and daughters with their mothers, but there comes a time
   when a family sits together to resolve their differences. Yesterday,
   who could not see the white bull outside here? The bull that was very
   fierce, that was almost on the neck of everyone who passed? That bull
   was not brought by accident, but it was brought by design, and that
   was a design for peace. So, with the words of the spearmasters over
   this bull yesterday, I thought that the entire effort was finished,
   and that we had come here simply for formalities. If we did understand
   the words of the spearmasters talking outside over the bull, and even
   inside here, I don't think we have much more to say. It has been done.
   We have only to reflect on the wise resolutions which we can make to
   bring the words spoken to their fulfilment.

<p> Something small that I would have said before, I will have to say now.
   Our meeting for peace has brought people from far away. Dr. Peter Nyot
   is here from Germany, and Michael Wal has come from the US, both have
   come from afar to join with us. This shows us that this is a serious
   matter since those from far away are joining with us here. As well,
   our foreign press people show that this is a world-wide concern, since
   organisations from far away have sent their representatives. We have
   even asked ourselves concerning some people, how they have come, if
   they were invited by the churches or other people. I'm seeing brother
   Samuel Aru with a very serious delegation from Khartoum, so I have
   asked myself if Omer Bashir is interested in peace. Anyway,
   translation of this kind, makes a very short speech, to be far too
   long.

<p> Therefore I'll conclude by speaking to the Dinka Chiefs and the Nuer
   Chiefs. Mine is a word of caution to you. You spoke well yesterday as
   spearmasters, as elders, and as leaders. I would want that to be
   repeated today. because we have come here to look for peace and
   reconciliation and unity. I am not saying that you should not air out
   your views, but that you should air out your views in a constructive
   manner. Don't quarrel here. Don't quarrel here. Don't quarrel here.
   You are to say your viewpoints here cool headed, rationally, and
   without raising your emotions. All of us, the intellectual guest, are
   here to help you come to helpful resolutions. You must say the right
   thing. It may happen that at some point one of you will call for us to
   close the discussion because we are all saying the same things. Avoid
   unhelpful arguments, matters that are not necessary in our discussion
   of peace and reconciliation. Let us avoid matters that look like we
   are in the courtroom. This is not a court we are creating here.

<p> So, before I go, I would like my counterpart, the Commissioner, to
   come here, so that we extend to each other, the greetings of peace.
   (The Nuer Commissioner comes forward, and the two grasp hands, holding
   their hands aloft before the community; the people on both sides
   respond with songs, chants, affirming the meeting. Nuer move into a
   full chant with extended responses).

<h>TD:
<p> I don't have much to do, since the Commissioner has already invited the Commissioner from Leer.
   
<h> Commissioner of Ler, Joseph Juac Kon:
<p> I'm greeting you in the name of God, in the name of our land, you, the
   Dinka and Nuer, our guests, and you who have organised this
   conference. As well, I'm speaking of the peace that was signed on the
   21st April, 1997. So I'm greeting in the name of the Peace Agreement.
   I am the person responsible in the government of Dr. Riak Machar for
   the Co-ordinating Council. I also greet you in the name of this
   Council. When the government was formed, the former commanders who
   were in the bush, these were chosen to become the governors. . . .
   Maker Macek. When I was appointed and came to Leer as its
   Commissioner, I was told that there was a grassroots peace initiative.
   Some of my leaders were taken to Loki for the meetings, and soon a
   number of abductees taken from our people were returned to us. I was
   there to receive them as they came home.

<p> I came here with fourteen chiefs from my area and others from other
   areas, such regions as Akoba and Nasir on the East Bank. And those far
   north of Bantiu. We all came together with firm hope and enthusiasm
   for this peace. We came hoping that the Nuer and Dinka will be able to
   live in peace. We, the Nuer from the Western Upper Nile, all came,
   except those from Menkin in the Bul area. You all know the conflict
   that continues there, and we ask you to hope with us that the fighting
   in that region will be brought to an end. I came here with the first
   Brigade Commander, and Acting Zonal Commander, Peter Pajiek, we came
   together so that he can talk to his forces, to preserve the
   resolutions of this important, historical occasion. We also came with
   Commander Gabriel Both Yol who is in charge of security in the Leer
   State. As well, because of the support of this peace by Dr. Riak
   Macar, the General Secretary of the USDF has also come so that he can
   report back the resolutions that are made here. Gabriel Yuol Dok, as
   Secretary of the Party is with us. The Khartoum Agreement was signed
   by Samuel Aru. He did not come here because he is a son of this area
   but because he is with Riak in the Government, and he has come to
   witness this important event. The Southern Defence Forces/Movement are
   represented by Commander Peter Riir Puk, (PRP comes forward and says
   that all the senior officers of the SPLA know me). The speech of the
   Governor of Bahr el Ghazel, Nhial Deng Nhial, made me very happy, when
   he said that the matter is not simply for the organisations to come
   together, but that we share common objectives. Having heard this we
   all slept very soundly, with the hope of these words. Also, as we are
   witnessing people as they speak, we are further convinced by the
   actions of Commander Selva. We are glad to see his firm, practical
   commitment to facilitating this effort toward peace between our
   peoples.

<p> I want to correct the statement made by our elder William, yesterday,
   when he said that he was a thief. He did not mean that he himself was
   a thief. We are all children of one father. Those who are raiding
   cattle are William's children, and thus he identifies with them. It
   seems this was misunderstood. Historically, we Nuer, have so many
   Dinka with us, and so many of our chiefs were originally Dinka. When
   Dinka came to settle in our land, we usually gave him the first place,
   choosing him as leader. We have no difficulty with a man from afar
   being a leader among our people.

<p> I conclude my speech offering that history. I greet you all in the
   name of Jesus Christ our Lord.
   
<h> TD:
<p> (What commander Selva said as he opened his remarks yesterday was
   simply a joke. There was no reference to the elder, William himself.
   It was simply a humorous comment). Our next speakers will be women,
   one from Bahr el Ghazel, and one from Upper Nile. The first is Awut
   from Bahr el Ghazel, to be followed by Deborah Nyandien from Upper
   Nile 

<h> Awut Deng Acuil:
<p> I am called Awut, a woman of Rek and Agar Dinka. I haven't nothing
   great to say today. In terms of age I am younger than most of you. I
   am only a child. The joy of the In such occasions, whether you are
   young or old, it will not prohibit from the young from speaking. I
   greet you all, and consider you all as my children. Women gives birth
   to a man, who becomes a white haired elder. What I want to say is that
   this gives us great joy that Nuer and Dinka should come together for
   all of us have suffered, with many women and children killed during
   the fighting between our peoples. I express my appreciation to NSCC
   and all affiliated churches that have brought us together. I express
   my thanks to both for SPLA as well as the USDF, for if they had not
   agreed, it would not have been possible for us to meet in this way. I
   thank all the chiefs and elders, Nuer and Dinka, who have come here
   knowing that fighting will get us nowhere, and that we must discuss
   our differences in this important gathering. I thank the foreigners
   who have come all the way to Wunlit to sit down with us and observe
   our negotiations. I will not speak long.

<p> This is not a court, but a process of reconciliation. The women of
   Bahr el Ghazel, concerning their children, those they have given birth
   to, that they don't want their offspring to be killed any more.
   Yesterday someone said that the women had stopped bearing children.
   Not only have they ceased to bear, but they wish that those who are in
   the army, as combatants could return to their wombs again. It is both
   the women of Nuer and Dinka who have borne children, but it is not our
   desire that our young should die without good reason.

<p> What I beseech you, the chiefs and elders of Nuer and Dinka, that you
   will settle these differences, that you come to final resolutions to
   stop the killing of our children. I'll do as the Commissioner of Tonj
   has just done, I call on Debora to come forward that we as women can
   greet one another (Debora comes forward; Awut begins to sing, "Dooray,
   dooray, we have come for peace"). We hope you have heard our voices.
   I've come to express my joy in this peace effort. I have nothing more
   to say, and give place to Deborah.
   
<h> Deborah Nyandien:
<p> I will speak, and I will use my Nuer language. The reason I speak in
   Nuer I'll tell you now. I am called Deborah Yaar Jieng. Those from
   Yirol and Rumbek will know me. My father and mother were Nuer who left
   their home for Dinkaland long ago. When they travelled, they went to
   settle near Yirol where my uncle, Nyibol, my uncles are here now. When
   I married, by accident, Mathiang Gok knew that their daughter was
   taken back to Nuerland. I will stop here concerning my own history,
   going to the centre of what I have to say.

<p> I greet you in the name of all women who have been created by God to
   bear children. People of God, you the NSCC, and all related churches,
   I greet you with appreciation for your efforts to bring our peoples,
   Nuer and Dinka, will have peace. I also greet all our guests who are
   here. Specifically, I greet Bill Lowrey, with thanks a hundred times
   over for his efforts throughout this long process until we meet at
   this stage. The two communities who first went to Bilpham to train to
   fight this war against the Arabs. I greet our elder Samuel Aru Bol who
   has come to witness this meeting. I am a women's leader among women. I
   have come with 11 women from Bentiu to attend this meeting. Six women
   have come from Khartoum, all Dinka women have come to observe.

<p> The Nuer women have sent a message to the Dinka women, which I now
   declare. This is similar to that given by Awut our sister. Since the
   1960s, beginning of the war of Anyanya I, we want to know from the
   men, why our children should be dying like this all these years! My
   word is like that of Awut. You the Nuer and Dinka women, and even
   those from outside, I want to ask the men this question. What I ask is
   how it is that, since the creation of the earth, whether in all of
   history any man has died with a child in his womb? I'm not asking for
   an answer, but I want you to think about it. Be quiet, and consider
   this question. I'll add this as well: Has any man ever felt the great
   pains of labour in giving birth? Women, we alone know the pain of
   giving birth, and our words and our thoughts must be taken seriously.
   Don't discard the importance of our words! You Dinka and Nuer don't
   often consider the thoughts of women, but today hear us clearly,
   concerning all the children have died among us. I'm saying this
   because , while your are in discussion, , know that we will watch you
   carefully. If you don't ultimately take our words seriously, then you
   must understand we will make a revolution, and we will stop giving
   birth. I know you men are laughing because you say you are married
   through payment of bride price over which women have no control, and
   also that women have no power to make a revolution against you.
   However, we are speaking today, not as the women of the past. I exhort
   you also, not to discuss, without taking a break from your
   deliberations. Take an occasional break. I thank you and conclude
   here.
   
<h> TD:
<p> Dr. Haruun Ruun invites the two Commissioners who have spoken as well
   as the two women who have just spoken to come forward. 

<h> HR:
<p> I am emotionally moved and cannot express my feelings strongly enough.
   I would like to summarise it in this way. I want the two Commissioners
   and the two ladies, and myself to join our hands, and declare that we
   will commit ourselves to do all we are able to bring this peace to
   fulfilment. We will urge our friends here in Sudan, in Africa, and
   outside Africa to stand by us, and to pray for us. Let me repeat the
   joke that was said earlier. The ladies said, we will go on strike. It
   is powerful, that women should refuse their husbands. We are no longer
   traditional ladies, we are women of the modern world and we know what
   we are able to do. Let us join hands. Now, you ladies, also, know that
   some of our boys are dying because you are saying, if you ;have no
   money and you have no cattle how are you going to marry me? You cannot
   win a child unless you have a cow with milk. We are all responsible
   for what happens among us. And we must all together accept the
   responsibility and work toward a solution. (The 2 women and 3 men join
   hands together in the centre of the house of meeting and photographs
   are taken. They lift their hands up together. The Dinka begin to sing,
   "We have come for peace . . ."). Thank you, all of you. Thank you. 

<h> TD:
<p> Let me read for you the programme. following. It is now 12:50. We will
   return at 2:50 p.m. The order of business will be as follows. What we
   will do is this. Any aspect of clarification can be made later. The
   Dinka will begin to speak of their experiences during recent years.
   The leaders of the Dinka will speak first. The Commissioners of Yirol,
   Tonj, Rumbek are full participants and can share in the content of the
   conference. I declare that we are free to go for lunch. 

<h>                         Afternoon Session, 3:15 p.m.

<h> TD:
<p> We have guests who have come who need chairs. I'm asking you Dinka to
   assist with this. Let us start our evening session. Before we move to
   the Dinka side we would like to make a few introductions. When we were
   in Nairobi we formed a team of Rapportuers, individuals who we believe
   are devoted to the peace process. These people are here with us,
   though two were unable to join us from Europe. Before us are:

<l> Mulana
<l> Dhol Acuil. 

<l> Mulana
<l> John Luk.

<l> Timothy Tut Chol, was responsible for contacts between NSCC and the
     SPLA

<l> On the side of USDF we have Bill Mar.

<l> We have Faruk Gatkuoth, also of USDF.

<l> The two who could not attend from Europe are Ruth Danier, and Majok
     Guando. I now invite Rev. Bill Lowrey to tell us something of the
     preparations.

<h> BL:
<p> Ever since the Loki Accord was signed on 10th June, 1998 we have had a
   team working on this Conference to take place in BeG. When we met in
   Loki the chiefs and churchleaders from the West side of the Nile put
   together their plans for this conference. One of the things they said
   was that this would be a conference of the people, in which local
   people would take the lead, and it would not include poliltical
   leaders. They may be present as observers but not as participants.
   They said that all of the people must be mobilised to participate in
   this conference, that NSCC should prepare the Conference, and that
   observers from around the world must be invited to attend. So for
   these many months there have been numerous people involved. Gradually
   the group has changed, with women and chiefs always part of the
   process, and always there has been the desire to have Dinka and Nuer
   from outside as full partners in the process. So I now want to
   introduce you to some of those people who are here now. Some are not
   present, but have worked hard over the months, but I'll introduce you
   to those who are now with us. The Chairman of our Team is Dr. Haruun
   Ruun.

<p> We have two people who have worked to mobilise the people in BeG and
   in Western upper Nile. One is Rev. Matthew Mathiang Deng. The second
   is Judge Telar Deng. We have had two women who have been involved with
   us, Awut Deng whom you heard speak this morning. The second is
   Nyawaraga Joshua who is not able to be with us today. We have asked
   intellectuals from the Diaspora to come and be part of this team. One
   of those is Dr. Peter Nyot Kok from Germany, and the other is Dr.
   Michael Lual Duany from the USA. Always, as it was possible, we have
   asked that Chiefs meet with us so that they could observe if we were
   keeping on the path that was set for us at Loki. And I, Dr. Bill
   Lowrey, have served as a facilitator for this Team. The two chiefs who
   have been most involved with us throughout this process are, first,
   Chief Dut Malual, who I understand is sick in Nairobi, and we are
   missing him. The second of them is Chief Isaac Magok from Leer
   (stands, waving his fly whisk).

<p> Now I would like to tell you a short story from the Bible, that sets
   the stage for the Dinka to tell their story before the Nuer, and for
   the Nuer to tell their story before the Dinka. This is a story that I
   told in Loki for the chiefs and leaders in Loki, and that was the
   beginning of three days in which they told their stories, each group
   to the other. As you know, today is Sunday, which is the first day of
   the week. It was on a Sunday, after Jesus had died on the cross and
   been raised from the dead, that this story took place. Most of the
   disciples were together in a special room, but one was missing. His
   name was Thomas. And suddenly Jesus appeared in the room, and his
   message was, "Peace be with you." The disciples were excited to see
   him, but when they told Thomas, he would not believe it. He said,
   unless I see him, and put my fingers in his side where the spear went
   in, I will not believe it. One week later, again on a Sunday, Jesus
   appeared in the room and Thomas was present. Jesus said to Thomas,
   "Reach out your fingers and feel the wound where the spear went in."

<p> This is a conference about reconciliation. Thomas could not be
   reconciled until he could see the wounds that he had helped to cause,
   and touch the places where Jesus had been wounded. For seven and a
   half years now, Nuer have caused wounds and injuries to the Dinka, and
   for seven and a half years now, Dinka have caused wounds and injuries
   to the Nuer. If you want to be reconciled you must tell each other the
   wounds you have suffered, you must look at each other, and reach out
   and touch one another in the places where you have been wounded. It
   will be important that you speak the truth, that you not hide anything
   from another, so that the reconciliation goes deep, and it is a
   genuine healing of the wounds you have inflicted. When you speak the
   truth, when you say the hard things to each other, when you identify
   the issues that must be solved, then you can reconcile relationships,
   and you can walk out of here, saying now we are brothers and sisters
   once again. In just a few minutes, you as the Dinka, will begin to
   tell the Nuer your stories. Do not hold back. Tell the true stories,
   no matter how painful it may be. In just a few minutes, when the Dinka
   tell their stories, you Nuer, you must listen carefully. Do not debate
   with them, do not argue with them. Relationships begin with listening.
   And when they have finished you will tell your stories to them. The
   time of beautiful speeches is over. It is now time for the hard work
   of peace. You must make a peace that will last. When I sit down, this
   will be your work. You, Nuer and Dinka, must make this peace and
   determine how deep the peace will go. May God give you the strength
   you need.
   
<h> TD:
<p> Okay, I introduce to you Dr. Peter Nyot Kok, who will take the chair
   as the Dinka present their narratives. The first speaker will be Chief
   Dut Yol. 

<h> Dr. Peter Nyot Kok:
<p> I greet you warmly, you Nuer and Dinka, you chiefs and elders, women
   and youth, you soldiers, may you all be blessed here. The talk today
   and onwards is for you the chiefs to talk, not me. However, after you
   have concluded your statements, I will speak. Peace and reconciliation
   began yesterday when a white bull was sacrificed, and libations were
   poured. We had already raised the house of peace, but what remains is
   the plastering of the walls and floor and roofing of the building of
   peace. However, this is not easy work that is before us. If we plaster
   the house wrongly it is likely that insects will still bight us. If we
   don't put up good poles it is likely that the house will leak. I will
   start with what Bill Lowrey has said, that we must draw from the
   experience of our ancestors. We do each stage of the work so that it
   is successful, and it is a solid house. During our meeting we will
   begin with the chiefs who attended the meeting in Loki, and we will
   move ahead so that a representative from each county has opportunity
   to speak. I am appealing to the translators who are speaking in Dinka,
   Nuer or English that you work to translate accurately, because this is
   a difficult aspect of our work. Now I will call Chief Kulong Marial
   and, secondly, Chief Juol Macok. Together they will have one hour to
   speak. 

<h> Chief Kulong Marial:
<p> I will not speak at length. I have been a chief for a long time, in
   the area of Mapeer in Rumbek. By ethnic group I am Agar from BeG
   Region. Some months ago I attended the meeting in Loki for the purpose
   of reconciliation between Dinka and Nuer. When I returned from Loki I
   disseminated the content of the Accord among Dinka and Nuer. Recently,
   I also participated in the exchange visits of the Chiefs, stopping at
   Leer, and here. Yesterday we began our reconciliation by offering a
   white bull, and we said all that needed to be said, and the bull is
   now in its eternal existence above. It has always been our traditional
   practice that, when we have conflicts, as we often do, we make
   sacrifice and we are able to reconcile and return to our normal life.
   Usually we conclude by confirming an accord between ourselves and Nuer
   with an accord that states we will no longer raid one another so there
   is no more loss of property or life. At the end of every conference we
   come out with declarations which are sent to Leer, Mapeer, Tonj, and
   elsewhere, confirming that we should no longer fight each other. And
   the present reconciliation, being assisted by the churches, means that
   we address the issues that divide us and bring conflict and we put an
   end to them. Sometimes back we had a conference in Gainlel, and we
   sacrificed bulls and that concluded our conflicts between Dinka and
   Nuer. As well, we had a conference at Wuniloor, and that meeting ended
   our problems until the conflicts of Anyanya I brought out new
   conflicts between Dinka and Nuer. The border conflicts intensified
   again with the tension between SPLA and Nuer, giving thieves concerned
   with their own well-being opportunity to exploit our differences. As
   well, our differences have been exploited by our enemies. D&N are
   brothers, who share common borders. With our sacrifice yesterday our
   hostility was brought to an end. There are people who are against this
   peace agreement, who have benefited from our hostility. There will be
   some who will come trying to persuade our peoples on each side to
   believe that the other will not be faithful to our agreement, but we
   must not listen to these deceptive words. We have always been fighting
   each other, D&N, but has never before happened that we deserted lands
   such as Mapeer. Today it is other people who have come in to
   exacerbate these conflicts. An example is that our ancestral home of
   Rumbek was in the hand in the enemy. Now that we have captured it from
   the enemy we have made alterations and we are able to occupy our own
   lands comfortably. As I said, in respect to Rumbek, I can now return
   to my ancestral home of Mapeer and we can settle there once again.
   Normally, in the relationship between us and Nuer, what keeps
   conflicts from being concluded, is when various pretexts are brought
   up, saying we must locate the thief, and find the details of the case.
   All of these are delaying tactics, which should not deter us from
   peaceful coexistence. Yesterday we sealed our covenant. It is not in
   Dinka tradition that we should begin accusing one another, or
   quarrelling with one another, after sacrifice is offered. We should
   not be doing this here. Our gathering here is heard all over the
   world, in Khartoum and Juba, and many other places. Thus, in my view,
   there is no use in talking about past grievances. What we need to
   focus on is concrete actions to be taken to bring peaceful
   co-existence between our peoples. From this day forward we must stop
   the killing of women and children, and destruction of our properties.
   We reconcile ourselves from Yirol, Rumbek and Bentiu. I will not
   proceed further with my address. This is the message I'm telling the
   people of Gogrial and Tuic, that our reconciliation was concluded
   yesterday with the offering of our white bull. This is my word. 

<h> PNK:
<p> We have heard Chief Kulong Marial. Our second speaker is Chief Jol
   Macok. 

<h> Chief Jul Macok Lieny:
<p> I am Agar from Rumbek. I am grateful to all who have organised this
   conference. I'm grateful to Bill Lowrey and greet him. I warmly greet
   my brothers from Bentiu, as well as those from BeG. Also, I greet
   those from Nairobi. We are here for peace and reconciliation, which we
   have accepted. This conference we declare that we have fully accepted
   this reconciliation. If we were in a court I would have asked
   questions from the people of Bentiu. When people first began going to
   Bongo, the training camp, it was because of the problem of the South
   that took them. When those who went to Bongo split apart, it was
   unfortunate that we accepted that separation. I never thought there
   was a government in Leer, until I saw the Commissioner of Leer. I have
   no bad commissioner from Leer. When we said earlier that we should
   save lives, I also accept fully what you said, because I have a border
   with Chief Malual Wun. In my community I have a few people from
   Bentiu, like those staying here at Wunlit. Our relationship with the
   people of Adoor, that is those of Yirol and Rumbek, is that we are
   children of one family. We had no part in the division that had
   happened. When I said I wanted to ask question of the people of
   Bentiu, I actually wanted to ask questions of those of Adoor. As a
   good gesture, and to declare that we accept peace, I want to say that
   those who raided cattle on the 18th have now been apprehended, and the
   cattle are to be returned. The civil administration in Rumbek ordered
   all chiefs to apprehend the raiders and return the cattle. This has
   now been done. (TD: I believe Chief Chul was speaking of two raids.
   One was on the 19th of February, and the other on the 8th. I believe
   that the those who were responsible for the first have been
   apprehended.) Before all who are in attendance here I want to affirm
   that we have agreed to accept the peace between us. At present we have
   people who have gone from Yirol to Adoor and they have been welcomed
   by the residents. I will conclude here by saying that we have
   reconciled with the people of Malual Wun as of today. 

<h> PNK:
<p> We have one half of an hour remaining from the time given to Rumbek,
   and we invite any other speakers from Rumbek, if they have anything to
   contribute. From Rumbek we have previously four people. We have Marial
   Malwal Arop and Col Madul Rilpiou. I now give opportunity to Chief
   Marial Malual Arop, to speak toward a peace that cannot be broken,
   cannot be demeaned by crooks. 

<h> Chief Marial Malual Arop:
<p> What I have to say is brief. Our father, Malual Wun, I greet them with
   those who came with him. I also greet all the chiefs from BeG. I want
   to greet our father Malual Wun is because he was active working
   together with my father. When Chief Kulong returned from Loki I asked
   if Chief Malual was still alive. Malual is now the only one remaining
   chief with sons of the chiefs who once were his counterparts. We are
   all children, of this one father who remains, Malual Wun. If there is
   a complicated problem, and your father is still alive, he would be the
   one who restrains the children from self destruction. The wisdom of
   CMW and our wisdom is not the same. He began working since the time of
   the British with our fathers. Most of us began working during the time
   of independence with the Arabs. We have always thought that CMW of the
   saying in Dinka. A lion said to a father to give him his children so
   he could eat them. Today all our fathers are gone except CMW. The lion
   ate all the elderly people, but one old person was hidden by his
   children. The lion that ate the elderly people happened to swallow a
   snake with water. The snake would come from his stomach, peaking out
   from his mouth. On person suggested that he bring and old man to take
   the snake from the stomach of the lion, wouldn't the lion eat the old
   man? The lion accepted the old man to be brought. He came and asked
   the lion to lay down, and tied a rat to the leg of the lion. Then the
   snake crawled out to eat the snake.

<p> To you, our father Malual, you are the only father of all our peoples
   among D&N. Now we want to draw out the snake now. If you have accepted
   that the snake in your stomach should be brought out by the rat we
   have accepted to bring out the snake, and that is why we have killed
   the white bull yesterday. Let your lion not come again to attack the
   children and the women. How could we refuse to accept peace? The toc
   which we have been sharing. Is your area Ganlil now empty of people?
   We have accepted reconciliation. When we bypass what our brother said
   before, and we sit to discuss the past grievances, we are quenching
   the fire with water and not quenching the fire with more fire. If
   there is any disagreement between the sides then we will not reach our
   conclusion. Let us close the old chapter since Anyanya I and begin a
   new chapter. This is not a court. If it were a court we would
   enumerate our grievances. If we are committed to reconciliation, let
   us not account for the past. Let us simply enter the reconciliation
   and act as brothers. Let peace multiply as each person accepts peace
   and returns home to plant this seed among his own people. We people of
   Rumbek, we have a commissioner. We are following the policy that has
   been put in our mind since the conflict began. We are continuing with
   it. To conclude my talk, it is that we used quarrelled in the past,
   but today our conflict is different. I believe we are one, we can
   follow each other's footsteps. We have now accepted reconciliation and
   peace. If people sit in such a house as this, this is a house of God.
   And if somebody comes against this you, our brother. Whatever the
   quarrel in the past, let it conclude. My word stops here.
   
<h> PNK:
<p> I thank you for your word, you people of Rumbek. Those of Rumbek are
   left with 5 minutes. Chief Col Madol Arilpiou will speak in this time.
   
<h> Chief Col Madol Arilpiou:
<p> The first person I will greet is God. As we are here in this house of
   God, we have been taught by the Christians. God hates Jealousy and
   hatred. God has tied the leg of hatred down now. This jealousy is
   called You, our brothers, Nuer, and Jieng, we have been made to
   collide. The two pieces of wood that have been put together to cause
   the fire. God has divided things long ago. He gave Nuer the young cow.
   He gave Dinka the old cow. This brought conflict, that we must now
   bring to an end. We Dinka we are willing to accept reconciliation with
   all our hearts, but we have some doubt about our brothers Nuer. You,
   Nuer, when we have something good, you change it into something bad
   the following day. The reason I say this, is that we went to Bongo
   because we have a problem. The Arab claims this land. When we went to
   Bongo it was because of that problem with the Arabs, but then we began
   to quarrel among ourselves. We have killed ourselves in greater
   numbers than our original enemy ever killed us. The conflict between
   D&N, has led to the point that the women are now the ones who die in
   large numbers. In the old days the men died and were eaten by birds,
   but today the women die. This has come from you Nuer. You are the
   cause of the death of women. You Malual, you stop that attitude, and
   stop killing women and children for no reason. 

<h> PNK:
<p> The addresses of Rumbek County are finished, and I thank you three
   chiefs. We have heard your words in full. As well I thank our brothers
   Nuer for listening carefully to what has been said. This is not the
   end of those who will speak. We will continue in the days ahead. Now
   we turn to the list of Chiefs of Tonj County which I have just
   received. There are three people: Chief Dut Yol, Chief Gum Mading
   Akucbeny, and our mother Sadia Manok. Just now I invite Dut Yol to
   come speak. You, people of Tonj County, you have but one hour to
   speak. 

<h> Chief Dut Yol:
<p> My name is Dut Yol Manyok, a man of Tonj County, and the section of .
   I will not speak at length. What I will say first is that I am pleased
   that all our people have gathered here. First I will speak about those
   things that have gone bad between us. I don't know what has killed me.
   First of all, we have simply been staying with the Nuer. When we went
   to the bush they took our children. What made them to quarrel in Bongo
   we still don't understand. Those who stayed with us as our brothers,
   they began to kill us. Some were staying with us and our people tried
   to kill them, but we refused. Those who wanted to return to their
   homes, we accompanied them. Some are still staying with us today. We
   have the chief called Mading Manyel who was killed together with his
   entire family and 18 cattle camps. Also 150 people were killed, and 5
   of our young women were taken who are with them until the present day.
   When they came they also attacked the section of Det Madheu. They took
   almost 20,000 head of cattle. 90 people were killed at once. Also,
   during the rainy season, they came and attacked the place of Makuac.
   When they came back to attack for the second time they took
   everything, leaving not even a dog or a chicken. they raided the
   entire cattle camp. All the homesteads were burned, all of Makuac was
   burned to the ground. After 11 days Aboc was raided, Cattle camp of ,
   Wunicuei,

<p> Mabior, Aboc, Makuac, Waiyaar CC, Wunicuei, Bikliir. They took all the
   chickens, the women children. Only a few of us remained who ran away.
   Now that you have come I am not angry, but happy. If even one person
   remains, and we have peace, that person can multiply. What I'm not
   happy about is our brother Nuer were the ones to start to explain why
   they have been killing me. This would have been far better. We have
   been reconciled by a man called Telar Ring in a place called Maal. Why
   they kill us, we would have preferred if they had spoken first so that
   they can explain precisely why they have killed us as revenge. Since
   they are with us now, and they all know me. some of them have their
   children staying with us here. Those children who I have accompanied
   back home, they are home now. I now want our brothers to speak out the
   grievances they have against me so I can understand. But the source of
   our quarrel is this, the Nuer and we are one. I don't look at them as
   enemies. We share one toc and one border between us. We regard them as
   our elders to ourselves because their father is elder. When their
   father was born he could not her but was deaf. When my father was born
   he was blind. He came in a secret way, my deaf uncle to raid my cattle
   because my father could not see. My father went to God and said that
   this brother comes and steals my cattle. And God said, okay, it is
   something good. God gave a girl to our Dinka father who was blind.
   Once he married, he never produced another blind man among his
   children. And the deaf father of Nuer never produced a deaf man. All
   their children have been healthy. I don't know what has happened.
   After we have produced good children we still carry on this old
   tradition because they have not liberated themselves from the way of
   their father.

<p> Today God went to bring a foreigners and told them, if these two
   peoples quarrel, stand between them, and see why they are quarrelling.
   Today, especially it is the Church leaders who have come here. It is
   the right time for them to ask us what our problem is so that it can
   be resolved between us. What I know in my heart this year, after they
   have killed our children, and killed our children, and taken all our
   cattle, and all the goats, after all of this, what remains is only
   their brother who is blind is their brother. They can take their blind
   brother and kill him. This is not the first reconciliation talks. We
   began them in Gainlel, and again we came to Mal. Today, in Wunlit,
   this is the third peace reconciliation. Those of you who have
   organised this conference, I ask you to invite our brother Nuer to
   speak out precisely what is in them, why they have destroyed us. You
   who organised this conference, I will not bother to talk about the
   loss of the cattle, or other property, or dead people. What we want
   from you, our brothers, are those young girls. Sincerely speaking, I
   ask you to send our girls back, we will console ourselves with them.
   Please release them to us.

<p> The second point to finalise my talk: if we want to be reconciled.
   Yesterday the white bull was killed. I will go back to my home and sit
   in my house, and try to buy simple goat. My talk is ended, but this
   point I will stress.
   
<p> (Goes across the room to put his house on the head f the old chief. he
   did this to show that his heart is open, he has nothing remaining, but
   his heart is open to reconciliation.)

<h> PNK:
<p> I am grateful for the word from Chief Dut Yol and for the gift he
   has given chief Kuol Muon. At the end of his talk, and as a sign of
   his reconciliation he has offered his had to the Nuer chief. Now we
   invite Chief Gum Mading Akucbeny. While we relay our story telling
   about past events, we also want to point to action we need to take to
   make peace in the future. We have between Gum Mading and Chief ... one
   half an hour.
   
<h> Chief Gum Mading Akucbeny:
<p> From the beginning I want to tell you this (begins to sing his own
   song, to which people respond; begins by saying, "I am Gum Mading . .
   ."). My name is Chief Gum Mading Akucbeny. I thank God and the NSCC
   for choosing Wunlit as a location for this conference. To my mind a
   genuine reconciliation will not include only D&N, but it must include
   all Southern Sudanese. This conference has also provided us with
   opportunity to meet with our children who have been cut off from us in
   Khartoum whom we've not met for a very long time. This conference has
   also provided an opportunity for our kinfolk in Europe and America to
   come so that we can meet one another. It is very good that our
   children whom we've taken to school to learn English and Arabic have
   also come to Wunlit, and that all people will now be able to hear that
   we have met at Wunlit to bring peace to the land. Yesterday during the
   opening the military authorities of the SPLA were here and we have
   seen them. We did not, however, know that there were military and
   civil administration from Bentiu who were likewise with us. We are
   glad to hear that there is a military commander coming directly from
   where Riak is staying to be in our deliberations, and that he will
   return to tell Riak of our progress.

<p> The first thing I would like to say, concerns we chiefs, who have
   remained with our people in S. Sudan and sent our children to schools
   or to Bilpham for training. The problems that occurred at Bilpham did
   not begin there, but they originated right here prior to their
   departure. In 1984 a group of young men from Gogrial and Tonj began
   departing for Bilpham. As they went they naturally had to pass through
   Nuerland. As they reached Abuong they were intercepted. Many were
   killed and others were drowned while some returned. This had nothing
   to do with the leadership. In the spirit of reconciliation we must
   begin with the genesis of the problem. It is not with the leadership.
   We would like to know the chief who was responsible for the killing of
   our young men as they were en route to Bilpham. It is important to
   begin with the genesis of the problem. That is why I asked for the
   senior military commander. That route through Abuong became unsafe for
   our the passage of our people and we were forced to move any parties
   through Bor area as our only alternative route. I challenge you,
   asking someone to come and tell me that this is not the real state of
   affairs, as I have described it. The route through Bor was a far
   longer route for our people. When we decide to reconcile and become
   one, I must tell you that, currently, we now have two of our people
   with you in Nuer. They have now devastated Gograil, . . . and Tuic
   areas. When you prepared to come, did you first really speak with them
   to ask what they intend to do. If we are sincere about reconciliation
   I address myself to those from Nuer area. You have with us Carbino
   Kwanyiny Bol and Matip. Does it really make sense for us to reconcile
   if they are not with us, because these two people are with you now. If
   we reconcile without their participation I believe our efforts will be
   incomplete. s we are all Southerners, we have lost our women and
   children, cattle and properties. I am glad to here that the
   Commissioner from Bentiu is here with us. As you saw yesterday, we
   have responsible people with us here from our side. I would hope we
   can also speak with Riak Machar to tell him that we as Southerners
   have lost everything we possess through our conflicts. First let us be
   practical, you the chiefs from N and from D. As you have seen
   yesterday, we don't have an army. Yesterday Governor Nhial Deng Nhial
   and Commander Selva Kiir were here to guard any agreement we come to
   in this place. What about you? Who will ensure that our agreement
   stands firm in your areas? When Chief Majok came here . . . Tell me,
   if we go to your area will we find that our Dinka are still alive
   there? As I said before, the Nuer are here with their property, they
   are here with their cattle and their children. If you want to take
   them with you are welcome to take them. But I would only ask that you
   reciprocate, allowing our Dinka people to return to us also. I
   conclude with greetings, and emphasise before the organisers, that
   this peace and reconciliation will be monitored, so that the Dinka can
   go to Nuerland and claim their properties and likewise the Nuer can
   come to Dinkaland to receive what belongs from them.
   
<h> PNK:
<p> I thank the two chiefs who have spoken now for their penetrating
   insights. I thank the Nuer for listening patiently to the presentation
   of the Dinka chiefs. Among the speakers from Tonj Country is Sadia . .
   . and in the spirit of this conference we would also like to hear the
   voice of our women. We will begin tomorrow at 9:00 again hearing the
   narratives of the Dinka. We will give three hours for the remainder of
   the presentations from the Dinka. Although the time allotted to the
   representatives from Tong is finished, will give a brief opportunity
   to Sadia to speak. I thank you all for your participation today.
