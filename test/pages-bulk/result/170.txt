<h> Tour de force

<p> The Lions have only ever won one series in New Zealand in more than
   100 years. At the start of their latest tour, Nick Greenslade meets
   key players on both sides, from past and present, to discover why the
   All Blacks offer the defining test in world rugby

<p> If the British and Irish Lions were ever to create an official team
   slogan, and in an age when you regularly hear talk of the Lions
   'brand' that may not be too far off, then it could be, 'How to win
   friends and influence people'. Take the great squad who travelled to
   New Zealand in 1971. They are lauded not just because they were the
   first and only squad from these islands to win a series in a country
   where rugby is the national obsession, but also because of the
   influence they exerted on the domestic audience.

<p> Before that tour, any team with the temerity to believe they were the
   equal of the All Blacks were quickly put in their place. But these
   Lions were different: with flair, determination and panache they at
   first stunned and then seduced the home crowd. 'It would be hard to
   overestimate their impact on New Zealand rugby,' says Sean
   Fitzpatrick, a World Cup winner in 1987 and All Blacks captain for
   much of the Nineties. 'Let me give you two examples, one tactical and
   one personal. Prior to that tour, everyone had tried to kick like [New
   Zealand full-back] Don Clarke, who was a legend as far as we were
   concerned. You ran up to the ball and hoofed it as hard as you could,
   as he did. Then along came Barry John, the Lions fly-half.'
   Fitzpatrick recalls the Wales player's unique 'round the corner'
   kicking style, as he puts it. 'It wasn't just that it was different.
   It was that it worked so well. After that, it was farewell to Don. I
   was a huge fan of Gareth Edwards, too. I even bought myself a red
   jersey so that when my brother and I played in the garden, he would be
   the All Blacks and I would be the Lions or Wales.'

<p> The Lions' victory was a wake-up call to New Zealanders, a reminder
   that obsession did not necessarily equate to dominance and that the
   same mistake could not be allowed to recur. No one felt this more
   acutely than Fitzpatrick himself, as captain in 1993. After going one
   up in a three-match series against the Lions, the All Blacks
   surrendered the second Test 20-7, leaving themselves just a week to
   recover and avoid the fate of the losing 1971 side. 'I said to the
   Lions captain, Gavin Hastings, almost immediately after the final
   whistle, "Just you watch how the country turns on the All Blacks". And
   it did. The week leading up to the series decider was comfortably the
   worst week of my life. That we won the final Test was entirely down to
   the fact that we each knew we wouldn't be able to face the country if
   we lost.'

<p> In 1974, the Lions travelled to apartheid South Africa. If New Zealand
   was the heart of rugby, then South Africa was its muscles and bones, a
   place where superiority had to be asserted through physical
   ascendancy. It was 'unmanly' to play any other way. 'I don't think the
   South Africans had any idea how much British forward play had
   improved,' recalls Wales's Mervyn Davies, a key member of a pack that
   absorbed then repelled a series of ferocious Springbok assaults.
   Grudgingly - and having watched their team lose the four-match Test
   series 3-0 they had little choice - the native volk conceded their
   side's inferiority. Far readier to accord respect to the Lions were
   the black townships, who supported the Lions because they identified
   them as their 'enemy's enemy'. The bond between the two groups was
   sealed when a township side became one of the few South African teams
   to cross the tourists' try line during the tour.

<p> In the early seventies, a Lions tour offered the opportunity to play
   in a country that few of the team had even visited. For those in the
   southern hemisphere, it afforded a rare glimpse of the best players
   from the north. Today, the international rugby calendar is cluttered
   with teams from these islands heading south to play South Africa,
   Australia and New Zealand. But these are not tours, at least not in
   the traditional sense. The back-to-back Tests, crammed into an already
   tight schedule to satisfy the demand of television networks, are over
   too quickly. The players spend most of their time in hotels and
   airports.

<p> A Lions tour should be and is different. The sportswriter John Hopkins
   oncedescribed it as 'a cross between a medieval crusade and a prep
   school outing'. Hopkins was no doubt thinking about the very first
   tour, to New Zealand in 1888 - a tour that, boat transportation
   included, lasted eight months. But he could have been writing about
   the 1971 tour: 26 matches not just in New Zealand but also in
   Australia (then considered a gentle warm-up), occupying nearly three
   months. This was when players, locals and journalists would mingle
   freely. Frank Keating, of the Guardian, has written of how the press
   of the day would allow the impoverished amateur players use of their
   hotel phones to call home. Professionalism has changed all that. The
   players in New Zealand with the Lions have everything they want. They
   are comfortable and well paid. Many of them have newspaper columns and
   sponsorship deals. And yet the point about touring is that it is not
   meant to be easy. As the 1997 Lions assistant coach, Jim Telfer,
   warned his men: 'It's a bit like when the British and Irish go abroad.
   The first thing they look for is a pint of Guinness. The second is a
   plate of fish and chips. The next thing they do is look for another
   British or Irish person. That won't do for me and it won't do for
   you.'

<p> Four years later, in Australia, this counsel appeared to have been
   ignored. If the official tour video can be believed, the closest that
   the 2001 Lions party came to immersing themselves in the wider culture
   was a few rounds of golf and a trip to the set of Neighbours. There
   are many reasons why that particular tour broke up in bitter
   recrimination, but one of them must be the management's unwillingness
   to allow the players time off, to encourage them to explore the local
   history and society. Compare that with Steve Waugh's Aussie cricketers
   who, at the same time, were making their way to England for the Ashes
   series but stopped off at Gallipoli to pay their respects to their
   fallen countrymen. Clive Woodward, coach of this year's Lions, seems
   eager to atone. At the press conference to announce his squad in
   April, he declared: 'We will be working with the New Zealand
   authorities to set up a full social programme. We want this set of
   Lions to be remembered as much for how they conducted themselves off
   the field as on it.'

<p> Woodward may well be pushing at an open door. 'There was outcry when
   Clive said that his team would be based in Auckland and fly out for
   any matches further afield,' says Sean Fitzpatrick, who will be
   commentating on the series for Sky. 'That's why I was delighted when
   he flew back last Christmas and said that the squad would be
   travelling around the districts. We want these guys in our community.
   We want the kids to be able to say they touched them. Lions tours only
   come to our country every 12 years so it's important that the next
   generation of rugby players gets a glimpse of them. Just as I was
   inspired by Gareth Edwards in 1971, there will be kids who will get a
   huge lift from seeing Jonny Wilkinson or Brian O'Driscoll play or
   train.'

<p> In truth, it will not be the Lions' external profile that most
   occupies Woodward in the forthcoming weeks - that's where Alastair
   Campbell, his controversial appointment as communications chief, will
   be required - but the more difficult task of maintaining internal
   harmony.

<p> A few months ago, I was talking to former Ireland captain Keith Wood,
   a leading figure on the tours of 1997 and 2001. When I made a casual
   reference to the British Lions, he immediately interrupted. 'I think
   you mean the British and Irish Lions,' he said. His intervention was a
   reminder that bringing together players from four different countries
   into a cohesive unit in less than two months, which is difficult
   enough, can be complicated further by politics and national rivalries.

<p> It is easy to forget how acute tensions were between the home unions
   at the turn of the 1990s as the Welsh struggled to come to terms with
   their own decline and as Scotland and England competed for supremacy.
   'You'd have the English in one corner, the Welsh in another, and the
   Scots and the Irish laughing about how much they were going to drink
   on tour,' says Scott Hastings, the Scotland centre who was part of the
   1989 and 1993 campaigns.

<p> It is believed that the decision to award the captaincy of the 1993
   tour to Gavin Hastings, instead of Will Carling, was made on the basis
   that few of the Celts in the party felt comfortable about playing
   under an English captain. Eight years later, in Australia, it was the
   turn of the Welsh to assert their tribalism. There is a story that
   when an English player sat down for breakfast with his team-mates from
   the Principality, they began to speak in Welsh. Perhaps more difficult
   for Woodward will be the task of making all 45 members of his party
   feel integrated and involved when only half can be selected in the
   Test squad. The Lions coach has said that he does not yet know the
   identity of the 22 players who will be chosen for the first Test
   squad. We should take him at his word. But there will come a point -
   no later than a fortnight hence - when the likely make-up of that
   starting squad will emerge. It is then that his powers of conciliation
   will be most tested.

<p> It is not clear when the term 'dirt-tracker' first surfaced, but it
   was popularised on the last Lions tour to New Zealand in 1993, when a
   rump of between 10 and 12 players were left feeling redundant and
   disillusioned. 'I think one of the saddest sights I've ever seen in
   rugby,' former England and Lions hooker Brian Moore says, 'was that of
   the midweek team being led off for a swim by one of the management
   while the Test team went through a private training session.' The
   performances of the midweek side in the games that preceded the second
   and third Tests were among the poorest in the Lions' proud history.
   Stuart Barnes, captain of the 'dirt-trackers', could not hide his
   disgust: 'I could never contemplate giving up like some of them did. I
   feel humiliated. It just didn't mean enough for some of our team to
   play for the Lions.'

<p> And yet the dirt trackers can help bolster morale. Never was this more
   apparent than in Australia in 1989. 'It was that midweek team that
   kept the tour on track,' says Ieuan Evans, the former Wales wing and a
   veteran of three tours. 'We had taken a hammering in the first Test
   and the way they went out and performed straight afterwards lifted
   everyone. They were called Donal's Donuts [after captain Donal
   Lenihan], but there was nothing soft about them.' From there, the
   Lions won the second and third Tests to become the only side to win a
   series after losing the opening match.

<p> Among the various battles that make the forthcoming series so exciting
   is that between the rival coaches: Clive Woodward, the World
   Cup-winner eager to enjoy one final honour in rugby before turning to
   football, against Graham Henry, the New Zealander who was in charge of
   Wales then picked to coach the Lions on that difficult and fractious
   2001 tour of Australia. Henry was the first 'foreigner' to coach the
   Lions and there was the inevitable backlash, even from within his own
   camp.

<p> 'That was one of the toughest periods of my life, no doubt about it,'
   Henry told me in Auckland in March. 'I had barely given a moment's
   thought to the Lions job in the 2000-01 season because I didn't think
   they would pick an overseas coach. When my appointment was confirmed,
   there were quite a few former Lions queuing up to say what a bad move
   it was. That was understandable. I didn't mind. I just felt humbled
   and privileged to have the job.'

<p> None of this would have mattered had he returned home victorious from
   Australia. He did not. After a wonderful win in the first Test in
   Melbourne, the Lions were soundly defeated by the Wallabies in the
   following game and narrowly lost the deciding match. 'Maybe because I
   was an outsider, it made me an easy target when we lost the series.'
   Yet even if Henry had won the series, there are grounds for believing
   that he would still have been a target. It is well documented that a
   cluster of squad members disliked him and his methods. Both in and
   outside the camp, there was a widespread feeling that the coach had
   already decided on his Test team even before the squad had departed
   for Australia. As in New Zealand in 1993, those who believed that they
   were surplus to requirements soon dissolved into truculent discontent.

<p> The very public spokesmen of this fifth column were Matt Dawson and
   Austin Healey. Both Englishmen could start a fight in an empty house
   so the New Zealander could have shrugged off their criticisms. More
   problematic for Henry were the reservations of England and Lions
   captain Martin Johnson, who would later write in his autobiography:
   'If the management had decided to send Matt [Dawson] home, I would
   have been on the plane next to him and so would a lot of the other
   guys.' It was hardly an endorsement of Henry's leadership.

<p> The contrast between Henry and Woodward could not be more marked. The
   former England coach is the business entrepreneur, ever willing to
   look beyond rugby for new ideas and to experiment with technology,
   management consultants and the military to achieve a competitive edge.
   Henry is a former headmaster and the absence of a corporate background
   in his CV is thought to have cost him his first chance of coaching the
   All Blacks when, in 1995, the game turned professional. He distrusts
   journalists and can often appear guarded and surly. It is impossible
   to imagine him employing Alastair Campbell, for example, as Woodward
   has done.

<p> Yet he seems more relaxed now, possibly because he is back among his
   own and because he finally has the job that he always coveted and few
   dispute his right to hold. If there is a general indictment of Henry's
   regime with the Lions, however, it is that he overworked his players.
   Jason Robinson and Keith Wood both told me that the relentless
   training sessions imposed by the management exhausted a squad already
   weakened with injury. An opposing view is voiced by current acting
   England captain, Martin Corry. 'I wouldn't necessarily agree that we
   were overworked,' he says. 'You have to remember that you've got
   players from four different nations, all used to playing in different
   attacking and defensive systems. The only way you can mould them
   together in one uniform style in such a short space of time is to put
   in the hours on the training pitch. If I had to summarise the problem
   with that tour, it was that the players didn't see it through the
   management's eyes and vice-versa.'

<p> Corry is a useful point of reference because, despite only making it
   on to the tour as an injury replacement and being marked down as a
   dirt-tracker, he worked his way into the Test team. 'I only arrived
   out in Australia at the end of the first week of the tour but I soon
   sensed the tension in the squad,' he recalls. 'The problem was that
   the coaches placed so much emphasis on winning the Tests. We could
   have lost all the provincial games and won the Test series 2-1 and
   that would have been a good tour as far as they were concerned. When
   you make such a stark distinction, then the guys who aren't in the
   Test side will inevitably start to feel like secondary citizens.
   Unfortunately, it only takes one player to complain for the whole
   negative vibe to start to spread. I think you'll find that a lot of
   the guys who felt unhappy were those who had been on the 1997 tour in
   South Africa, which was successful. I had nothing to compare it with
   so I was just happy to be there.'

<p> Henry is at least prepared to acknowledge Corry's point, albeit
   obliquely: 'I concentrated on winning rather than individuals. That
   tour was the biggest learning curve of my career.' Yet the sour note
   on which that experience ended has been replaced by a renewed relish.
   'This is the biggest rugby, no, sporting event we have had in this
   country since the 1987 World Cup,' he says now. 'It should be the
   ambition of every southern-hemisphere player to face the Lions. None
   of our guys has ever faced them before and with the Lions not coming
   to New Zealand again for another 12 years, they probably won't get a
   second chance. So you would hope that everyone would be busting a gut
   to make this team and to do the same once they're in.' It is an
   intimidating prospect. Yet you know that Clive Woodward would not want
   it to be any other way.

   dry. The travelling army should, however, be able to sate its thirst
   at a five-day wine festival laid on for its benefit in Marlborough in
   the South Island, as well as other receptions held around the tour
   itinerary. Would that the All Blacks show the same hospitality on the
   pitch.
