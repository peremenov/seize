<h> UEFA Cup

<h> Race row casts a dark shadow over clubs' successes

<h> GERRY BRITTON

<p> THERE is no denying that the last few days have been exciting times
   for Scottish football. Rangers' win in the Old firm derby re-ignited
   their own challenge for the SPL title, while magnificent results for
   our European representatives in midweek meant that, for once, we have
   a realistic chance of watching more than one of our club sides
   competing in the latter stages of the UEFA Cup.

<p> While the back pages of our national press should have filled with
   morale-boosting tales of these exhilarating triumphs, the spectre of
   sectarianism and racism has raised its ugly head again, instantly
   dislacing the feel-good factor that all involved with the Scottish
   game should be currently experiencing.

<p> Unfortunately, the sickening examples of intolerable prejudice that
   have been highlighted in our country recently have been replicated in
   other European countries. There was the despicable abuse meted out to
   England's black players in Spain, and down south a Blackburn fan was
   in court over his racist abuse of Birmingham striker Dwight Yorke. The
   fact that Yorke had previously been an outstanding goalscorer for the
   Ewood Park side, and most probably a revered favourite of his abuser,
   makes the incident all the more ridiculous and incomprehensible.

<p> Scotland in the 21st century is an ever-increasingly multi- cultural
   assemblage of people who profess to varying creeds and possess
   differing tones of skin pigmentation. Scottish football mimics this
   growing diversity with a growing number of players and fans with
   ethnic origins and religious beliefs which are different from the
   white men who have traditionally made up the British footballing
   community.

<p> Yet no matter where they come from or what colour they are, every
   football fan can still identify a sub-standard player from the
   terraces, and, as a cash-splashing stakeholder in our beautiful game,
   is well within their rights to loudly vent their opinions on a
   player's inadequate display. But it is when a sectarian or racist
   expletive is added to their harangue that the line has been crossed
   and acceptable criticism from the stand degenerates into a vile
   personal onslaught.

<p> A thick skin is a necessary prerequisite for all wannabe professional
   footballers - we all know that there will be regular assassination of
   our on-field qualities from both supporters and coaching staff. In
   fact, many players channel the criticism, and find that the passionate
   pelters help them achieve a greater level of performance than they
   could ever have otherwise managed.

<p> Enjoying an after-match refreshment with my former Dundee team-mate
   Noel Blake, I made a mental note to maximise the effort in my
   performance in the upcoming Dundee derby when an idiotic United fan
   relentlessly chided myself and Noel over our supposed shortcomings.
   Noel regarded the situation with his customary grin until the
   brainless fan then drew attention to the fact that Noel's complexion
   was darker than the ruddy exterior of his harasser. Idiotic to bring
   race into an argument and idiotic to do so with a man who could easily
   have been mistaken for Marvin Hagler's twin brother.

<p> The incident which saw Dundee ban one of its season ticket holders
   from Dens for life for verbally abusing two black Celtic players
   showed that there are means to curtail the despicable actions of a
   mindless minority. The hard line taken by Dundee in that instance
   served as an example to any other fans who feel that it is acceptable
   to have a go at an opposition player on account of the colour of his
   skin. And the fact that it was an appalled 14-year-old Dundee fan who
   brought the moronic outburst to the attention of the authorities
   proves that there are ways that decent supporters can play their part.

<p> At Partick, we have three black players on our books: Jean-Yves Anis
   and Armand One from the Ivory Coast and the magnificently-named
   Emmanuel Panther, brought up in not so exotic Maryhill and boasting an
   accent that would not be out of place on River City. In conversation
   with them on the subject recently, they assured me that there have
   been few occasions in their careers when they have been subjected to
   racial abuse. Unfortunately my ex-Livingston team-mate Brian McPhee
   has not been so lucky. He has the regrettable distinction of seeing
   fans of visiting sides end up in court two weeks in succession for
   spouting race-based vitriol in his direction.

<p> During my tenure as a Dunfermline player, the reputation of the Pars
   was tarnished when our black central defender Dave Barnett asked to be
   released from his contract on the grounds that he could no longer work
   within our allegedly racist environment. The front pages of the
   tabloid press were covered with Barnett's racist claims, much to the
   bemusement of the staff at East End Park, and particularly our general
   manager Paul D'Mello, who also happens to be black.

<p> It was to everyone's surprise, then, that when pre-season training
   commenced the following campaign, Dave was seated back in our
   apparently racist dressing-room having been granted permission by the
   Pars bosses to engage in our fitness conditioning.

<p> Race was never a problem during my time with the Pars, as I am sure
   even Dave would now acknowledge. As I recall, the only burning crosses
   I encountered at East End then were the ones that skelped off my
   forehead having been fired from the scintillating left foot of our
   rotund wing wizard Stewart Petrie.
