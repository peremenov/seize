<h> Matsushita's "Sound Window"

<h> By Barry Willis

<p> April 14, 2002 -- As normally conceived, loudspeakers
        use electrodynamic forces to control the movements of their
     diaphragms, which in turn move air. Matsushita Electric Industrial
   Co., Ltd. has come up with an interesting twist on this principle, one
   in which air pressure itself ("aerodynamic-drive technology") is used
    to control the diaphragm. The result is a transparent panel speaker
   called the "Sound Window," announced by the Japanese industrial giant
                                 March 27.

<p> The invention is intended to mate acoustic radiating surfaces with
    video displays, enabling the launch of sound and image from the same
      surface--or at least, from two closely-spaced surfaces--thereby
        eliminating the need for the deep cavities required to house
   traditional moving-coil drivers. The goal is maximum performance with
   minimal energy expenditure from an integrated audio/video source with
    shallow depth--in other words, a television-like device that can be
                  hung on the wall like a framed picture.

<p> Sound Windows employ a lightweight transparent panel suspended a
   fraction of an inch from another surface, such as a video screen. The
     sound pressure from a small conventional cone driver acoustically
         vibrates the transparent panel, which can be 10 times--or
    more--greater in diaphragm area. The aerodynamic-drive technology is
       said to ensure sound-pressure transmission to the entire panel
   surface. Matsushita claims this "acoustic leverage technology" enables
        the Sound Window to operate on as little as 1/25 the power a
     conventional driver would require. Panel shape isn't critical, the
                            manufacturer states.

<p> With varying degrees of success, other manufacturers have experimented
    with flat-panel speakers. Matsushita claims that the Sound Window is
    the industry's first speaker "that reproduces sound by pneumatically
   vibrating a transparent panel using aerodynamic-drive technology." The
         device appears to offer the most promise for use in small
       communications products, such as cell phones, personal digital
     assistants, and laptop computers. The Sound Window's extremely low
   power consumption would appear to make it ideal for such applications.
        Matshushita plans to ship the first Sound Window products to
                   industrial customers later this year.

<p> Matsushita doesn't specify the frequency response, distortion level,
    or output capability of the Sound Window. Presumably, none of these
    specifications is audiophile grade, but the ingenious device proves
    that new designs for sound generation are possible for inventors who
       think outside the box. A complete press release, including an
                    operation diagram, can be seen here.
