<h> Sifting and Sorting Through the 4-Blocks Literacy Model

<h> The Media Center as the Hub of Four Blocks

<p> An inquiry came recently from Sylvia Hix, a Library Media Specialist
   at Lakeview Elementary in Nashville, Tennessee. Sylvia and a teacher
   in her school were busy writing a grant to support some training in
   Four Blocks, and she wanted me to share with her how---and if---I felt
   that a media specialist could be helpful and involved in the school's
   implementation of the Four blocks framework. Sylvia and I both thought
   that our discussion might be useful to others.

<p> Yes, media specialists can be critical to the success of 4-Blocks in a
   school. Of course, teachers can be successful in spite of that lack of
   support from the librarian/media specialist, but those teachers really
   have to be super-motivated and super-informed. When the partnership is
   strong between teachers and the media specialist, implementation can
   be so much easier and so much more successful.

<p> Below are some ways that media specialists can help:

<l> 1. Media specialists can keep teachers updated on good read-aloud
       printed material for their SSR Block. Using a few minutes during
       each faculty meeting would be a great way to model read-aloud
       techniques and to give advice about titles that would be of
       interest to kids at different grade levels.
	   
<l> 2. On some days, librarians can actually do the read-aloud portion of
       the block for classes that are using the library for SSR Block on
       a rotating basis. The kids then select books from throughout the
       library with the help of the teacher and the librarian. Learning
       to pick appropriate books is an important skill for students and
       is usually acquired with help from one of these knowledgeable
       adults.
	   
<l> 3. Librarians can be instrumental in helping teachers make decisions
       about books that would be popular and appropriate to include in
       the students' book baskets during SSR Block. In some schools that
       don't have generous classroom libraries, the librarians actually
       help teachers stock the individual book baskets. Stocking the
       baskets is a difficult task as we look for a variety of ranges:
       readability levels, topics, genres, and authors.
	   
<l> 4. Librarians can help with selections that can be used for the
       grade-level and easier materials during Guided Reading. Multiple
       copies of texts are almost always used for Guided Reading Block.
       Librarians can make recommendations about appropriate texts and in
       some cases might even store multiple copies from which teachers
       can make their selections. It's of little use for an individual
       teacher to have a huge collection of multiple texts when these can
       be stored in the library and made available to more teachers. The
       below grade level texts are sometimes difficult for teachers to
       access.
	   
<l> 5. Librarians can furnish appropriate texts for Words Block where
       teachers are always on the lookout for rhyming texts or those
       books that allow them to explore the word level of reading.
	   
<l> 6. Librarians can encourage teachers to use certain books for their
       modeling during Writing Block where authors use techniques, styles
       or offer exemplars of good Standard English that would help
       students grow in their own writing.
	   
<l> 7. The librarian can set aside space for student publications from
       various classrooms that are publishing during their Writing Block.
       Some librarians may want to actually put a bar code on the student
       publications and find prime display space for them. This would
       really motivate students to improve their writing! Students
       writing is exponentially better when they know that they have a
       real audience---and especially when that audience is their peers!
	   
<l> 8. The librarian may want to host a monthly (or whatever time period
       seems reasonable given all the tasks they do!) Authors' Tea for
       students who have published at certain grade levels or for
       representatives from each classroom. This again would keep those
       kids writing! Tables might even be set up for autographing.
	   
<l> 9. The librarian could be the person who helps the adults in the
       school establish a reading habit for themselves. Often, as we
       encourage students to acquire good reading habits we don't see
       that we are their best models for lifetime reading. We may use the
       time in school to help establish students' reading habits, but we
       hope and expect that there will be transfer outside of the school.
       We may never be able to convince kids of this if we don't see
       ourselves as readers. The librarian might be the person who
       includes adult books (not the X-rated ones---these are books for
       adults!) in the faculty newsletter. Or, perhaps the librarian
       starts a book club for faculty members who want to gather once a
       week or once a month to discuss a book they all agree to read. We
       could simulate Oprah's book clubs where we chat about the book and
       have snacks or dinner together. What fun! And, the students would
       know about it, too! They would know that we ARE readers---we
       practice what we preach!
	   
<l> 10. The librarian can serve as the hub for 4-Blocks growth in the
       school not only by furnishing books as stated above, but also by
       keeping the momentum going---displaying posters of students' work,
       displaying teachers' work, posting ideas for teachers to try in
       their 4-Blocks delivery, inviting teachers and students to review
       books and write advertisements for them, displaying a Word Wall,
       etc.

<p> Yes! The librarian can be instrumental in keeping 4-Blocks alive and
   well in a school. There are many additional ways that you could use
   your time to support tremendous changes in teaching and learning in
   your school. I hope that these few ideas will spark your creativity as
   you support Four Blocks implementation!
            ____________________________________________________

<h> ANNOUNCEMENT:
<p> My newest book, Modifying Four-Blocks at the Upper
   Grades (2001, Carson-Dellosa) is now out! I'm glad to have the writing
   of this one behind me, and I hope it'll be helpful to teachers at
   grades 4-8 and, perhaps, those at 3rd grade who have more advanced
   students. Let me know what you think after you've had a chance to read
   it. There are some great reproducibles in the back on the book!
            ____________________________________________________

<p> Notice For Grant Writers: If you're writing grants and need assistance
   with implementation in your schools and districts, I'm willing to
   write letters of intent/commitment to support your training and
   implementation. I've furnished quite a few of these lately. I
   certainly want you to get good training and I'll be sure that you do!
   Just email or call if you need a letter. I know that most of your
   grants are due soon.

<h> Personal Journal:

<p> Sad news to share with those of you who have written to me since
   Leadership Conference about my critically ill mother-in-law: Freida
   died on March 17th. She was a wonderful, wonderful woman whom we'll
   miss terribly. Thanks for your kind thoughts and prayers that have
   sustained us throughout this difficult time.

<p> Sylvia, Eve, and I had another day with the good folks in New Jersey.
   (We couldn't wait to get in that Sunday night to eat at Mastori's
   again!) Thanks again to Suzanne Phillips for taking care of travel
   details and for hosting my day!

<p> I loved my quick visit to Albuquerque and Phoenix. What a beautiful
   part of the country! Thanks to "mailring buddy" Susan Nixon for
   whisking me to the airport just in time for my flight all the way back
   across the country that evening! Don't know what I'd do without a
   little help from my friends!

<p> I had a great group of folks in Houston this week who were patient
   with me while I delivered my message with one of the worst colds I've
   ever had! They were very kind. Many thanks! It's hard to be on the
   road when you're sick. I took my cold on to another group in San
   Antonio today. Hope I didn't leave any cold germs behind as mementos!
   It was great to find that 4-Blocks is spreading in San Antonio. I've
   done a good bit of work there over the past two to three years through
   Region 20. The data coming out of that area sounds phenomenal! They
   shared very kind words about the new upper grades book that excited
   me!

<p> Hope everyone's enjoying Spring Break or that you're now returning to
   your schools renewed and re-energized!
