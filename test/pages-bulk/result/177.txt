<h> Former Defense Secretary Cohen's Remarks at the 2001 Summit

<h> The Honorable William S. Cohen
<h> Chairman and CEO
<h> The Cohen Group
<h> (Former U.S. Secretary of Defense)

<h> March 6, 2001

<p> "That's the first introduction I've had with music accompaniment, but
   thank you, Jim, very much for the introduction. And I thank you for
   your exaggerations in terms of my career but I relish every
   description you gave.

<p> "I believe that you are about to depart here in about 15 minutes and
   go to Capitol Hill where you will be entertained and spoken to by
   among others Senator Warner. Senator Warner is my senior by one day in
   the United States Senate, and you might ask him how that occurred as a
   matter of conversation.

<p> "But he is the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. He
   also is the sponsor and the creator of a new subcommittee on the
   Senate Armed Services Committee called Emerging Threats and
   Capabilities. He also sponsored a scholarship program to encourage
   more students to become information security specialists. So he has
   played a critically important role in a field in which you are deeply
   engaged.

<p> "I will be brief because the buses I am told will not leave before I
   finish but I want them to leave reasonably on time.

<p> "You were addressed I believe earlier this morning, or afternoon, you
   heard from Congressman Dave McCurdy, Senator Bob Bennett and Mike
   Vatis about global infrastructure of security. I'd like to take a
   little bit different tack here today, this afternoon, and talk about a
   different aspect of national security.

<p> "It seems to me that virtually every cover story that I see about IT
   in recent magazines has been about security. The good news is it's
   helping to raise public awareness and corporate awareness about the
   issue of protecting secure information. The bad news, I think, is that
   you're basically seeing what I would call off Broadway productions
   when the real show was taking place in Times Square itself.

<p> "The media attention is focused upon teenagers who are defacing
   websites, launching denial of service attacks or juvenile
   extortionists who steal and threaten to post credit card numbers.
   These are serious problems with very large amounts of money attached
   to them, but the threat to privacy and proprietary information is
   about to explode in a world that many of you are designing and
   building and one in which the capabilities are embedded into devices
   all around us and soon even within us. These devices are
   interconnected to a network that spans the globe. If John Chambers
   were here, he would describe this as the virtual global ecosystem.

<p> "Now, hackers and crackers, they are mere nuisances compared to
   another growing threat that I've tried to focus on and one I want to
   discuss with you today, and that is the convergence of the world's
   second oldest profession with the latest technology and its
   implications for the business community. Corporate espionage has
   always been, or at least it should have been, a concern for the
   business community, because while the average cost of a hacking attack
   or denial of service is said to be roughly $150,000 in terms of the
   costs to a company, according to the FBI the average loss of a
   corporate espionage incident is much larger.

<p> "There is a survey that was conducted in 1999 by ASIS, the American
   Society for Industrial Security, and over half of the manufacturers
   who were surveyed reported being a victim that year with an average
   loss of $50 million per incident. Nearly half of the companies
   surveyed were, they described themselves as high tech firms and they
   reported these incidents, and while they lost only a half a million
   dollars per incident where the loss could be valued, they were
   successfully targeted more than 60 times during the course of the
   year. So you can see this can add up to many tens of millions of
   dollars.

<p> "Despite the fact that the heavy focus is on Internet hacking as such,
   the incident for corporate spying is roughly the same. You have
   roughly the same amount of attacks on the penetration attempts for
   corporate proprietary information as you do for denial of service
   attacks. And so others have now indicated that over a third of U.S.
   companies are now the target of industrial espionage with the numbers
   that are quadrupling since the beginning of the last decade every
   year, and there is no end in sight.

<p> "I mention this because in spite of the legislation that's been
   passed, I helped to author an act called the 1996 Economic Espionage
   Act along with Senator Specter, making it a crime to engage in such
   activity. But a significant portion of those corporate espionage
   activities are actually sponsored by foreign governments.

<p> "I think it is somewhat of a paradox that state-sponsored espionage
   has become even greater at the end of the cold war than it was during.
   In fact, a number of these espionage apparatuses, apparati I guess it
   would be called now, were redirected to spy on behalf of the
   businesses in their country.

<p> "I am not talking to you now as a former Secretary of Defense but
   calling upon my experience of a total of 24 years on Capitol Hill and
   draw upon the statements that I made at that time. It was nearly a
   decade ago when Boris Yeltsin gave a very historic speech on the floor
   of the United States House of Representatives to a joint session of
   Congress, and you may recall this. He said, 'No more lies.' I think
   because of the thunderous applause that he received people thought he
   said, 'No more spies.' And yet we know from recent events and recent
   revelations, that clearly is not the case.

<p> "The point is that we should have known this all along. If anyone got
   the impression at the end of the cold war that that meant that there
   is no one left to come in from the cold, then they didn't get that
   impression from Moscow because after the collapse of the Berlin Wall,
   the head of the KGB Vladimir Karyoshkov[?], he publicly announced that
   his agents would be busier than ever with an enhanced focus on
   industrial espionage.

<p> "The KGB is far from being alone in this regard. Not long after the
   Director of the KGB made his announcement Pierre Marion[?], the former
   director of French intelligence directorate, publicly admitted that he
   directed the intelligence forces of France to secretly collect and
   pass on to French companies information they were able to secure from
   their competitors in the United States and elsewhere.

<p> "And our friends in the French intelligence service provide a full
   range of services. Among those that are most widely publicized are
   cases in which they stole proprietary technical data from a U.S.
   computer manufacturer and then provided it to a French competitor.

<p> "Another case in which we had a French national working for a U.S.
   fiber optics company sold trade secrets to the French intelligence,
   which then in turn passed it on to the French competitor. And in the
   case that Monsieur Marion was particularly proud of, the French
   intelligence acquired the pricing proposal from a U.S. aircraft
   manufacturer, which enabled its French rival to underbid it in a
   billion dollar contract.

<p> "In short, the espionage threat is no longer solely focused on state
   secrets. It's primarily targeted against trade secrets. And the threat
   comes not from just our adversaries, but ironically enough from our
   allies. And while the threat to the technology is real, they don't
   have to steal the technology itself. In fact, it may be more difficult
   for them to work with technology that's stolen. What they really want
   is the information on which you price your product, and they want to
   be able to underbid you and then offer it to their competing firms.

<p> "Now, some of you might be aware that the European Union, or the
   European Parliament I should say, is currently conducting an inquiry
   as to whether the U.S. intelligence agency is providing information to
   American businesses. Let me say that the allegation is false. It is
   unfounded. U.S. intelligence agencies do not, they cannot and they
   will not steal information from foreign companies to benefit U.S.
   companies, and there are many practical reasons why this is the case.
   We cannot do so, but more importantly U.S. officials across a number
   of administrations have made it clear as a matter of principle that we
   would never do so.

<p> "Corporate espionage and even corporate espionage conducted by foreign
   governments, their intelligence services is nothing new. The point I
   want to make today is it is intensifying at ever growing rates, and
   what is making it even more difficult for us is that we are becoming
   increasingly more vulnerable because most of the companies that you
   represent you are adopting information based systems to manage
   research, design, production, finances, customer relations and as
   companies have adopted new business models and new technology, they
   have also created new vulnerabilities. Let me give you just a few
   examples.

<p> "What is a code word that constantly is invoked if you're trying to
   streamline, get more efficient, downsize? You outsource. We did a good
   deal of this in the Pentagon itself, but there has been an increasing
   accelerative move on the part of businesses to outsource anything
   that's not regarded as a core competency in activities that were done
   in-house from the back office functions to logistics to production,
   and a company will often give its supplier privileged access to
   facilities and increasingly to its network so they can become an
   effective member of the team. But the suppliers are also
   electronically networked in ways that you have never even thought of.
   They themselves face pressures of outsourcing some of their non-core
   competencies. And so you have a series of a chain of trust being
   delegated to relationships upon relationships until you finally have
   complete strangers who are interconnected to your innermost working
   databases.

<p> "Outsourcing of software production I think it's very clear is growing
   every year that software production is being outsourced overseas. And
   we think of the three I's. India, Ireland and Israel are the most
   obvious examples. But the phenomenon is global. You can hire online a
   programmer in Pakistan with a Master's degree, three years of program
   experience for roughly $1,200 a month, and one that has 12 years of
   experience for about twice that much.

<p> "This creation of the global labor force is a great boon to our
   industries, and it's also helping develop economic situations around
   the world. But it also creates unprecedented vulnerabilities.

<p> "Another thing is taking place, consolidation. How many of you in the
   audience are under pressure to increasingly consolidate, to merge with
   various companies? Those who survive this consolidation are not really
   focused on the networking systems of emerging partners. They are not
   worrying enough about the in-laws that they are marrying up with. And
   whether you merge or acquire a company, you take on board those
   external relationships with outsourcing suppliers and agreements that
   cover that relationship no matter how inadequate.

<p> "As you all know computing capability is being embedded in devices all
   around us. In copiers, coffee pots, cars, clothing, even in our
   bodies. These embedded devices are now being interconnected with our
   offices. They operate our factories. They tie our suppliers and
   industrial partners, and they reach around the globe.

<p> "I want to say this afternoon that promiscuity in the cyber realm is
   equally dangerous to your health and presents the same risks as
   promiscuity in the physical realm. Every one of your partners has his
   own set of partners who in turn have their own partners, and you are
   effectively sleeping with every single one of them. The result can be
   a contagion of what I would call STD, sensitive technology
   distribution, for which there may be no cure. Drug companies can rest
   assured that there is no patent to be infringed upon here.

<p> "A decade ago, I'll give you some examples, a decade ago there was a
   good deal of attention focused on a Dallas computer maker that he
   learned that his pricing information somehow had gotten into the hands
   of a South Korean rival. That rival had used that information to
   tailor its own bids and take away the competition.

<p> "So the Dallas company hired a private detective agency. They
   discovered a coat closet at corporate headquarters had a small box
   inside that room containing a radio transmitter that was wired to a
   cable that led to one of the company's fax machines. The bug had been
   planted by a new employee who had been a mole for the South Korean
   company. So in order for that Dallas computer company to be penetrated
   a decade ago, the Korean mole had to gain access to the fax machine,
   splice in a tap, hide the radio transmitter in the closet.

<p> "Today, it's much easier, and I want to cite just one example. Today
   most printers and faxes and other peripherals that have infrared ports
   for data exchange and so does your Palm Pilot, or I have up here a
   little demonstrative evidence, a Visor. As I walk into your conference
   room for a meeting, my Visor can communicate with your printer, which
   may be connected to your network. If I can beam into your printer, I
   can own your network. Oftentimes companies have printers, fax machines
   and other desktops right in line of sight as people enter the
   premises.

<p> "So you want to think about this the next time a bicycle courier drops
   into your office. And I want to give you another practical insight as
   to what can take place.

<p> "When I was in the Senate, there was a common scam being run by
   unscrupulous bicycle couriers who visited virtually every office and
   they would ask to use the phone to call the dispatcher after they had
   dropped off their package to your office. Of course, they had set up a
   1-900 number which they were collecting either a dollar or two on
   every call that was being made and placed.

<p> "Now, if they can be creative enough to put a system like that
   together where they can make quite a few dollars, imagine if they
   carry and come in with a little infrared device that can download
   information off one of your printers or fax machines. So you have to
   be careful what is available to them.

<p> "As this chain of connectivity grows exponentially, the number of weak
   links is going to grow even faster, and no one -- I will say no one --
   is properly prepared to protect themselves in this emerging embedded,
   networked environment. And so there are quite a few people who are
   working very hard to exploit your vulnerability.

<p> "As I was looking over the material for today's conference, I also
   came across something in Newsweek last week. It was in the Cyberscope,
   and it had two new items that it called the reader's attention to. One
   is called Beamie Baby, and it talks about taking your Palm Pilot or
   your Visor, walking through an airport and they would have a cereal
   size box which you could download your e-mail or get information off
   the Internet. Well, if you are beaming up from your Palm Pilot or your
   Visor or other PDA that you might have information you pull of the
   Internet, you can also have a situation where they're pulling
   information out of your Palm Pilot. So if you have any kind of
   proprietary data which has been downloaded so you can travel
   conveniently, you'd better take care that that information is fully
   protected.

<p> "Microsoft, also it says 'Microsoft's latest trick, a phone with a PC
   built in,' and it has a nice photograph of the PDA and a phone, which
   is very convenient to have it all in one. One of the problems, of
   course, is that your phone can be put on remotely. Assuming your phone
   is turned off and you're in a conference room, you should take care to
   take the battery out of your phone because your phone can be activated
   and serve as a receiver and the entire conversation can be picked up
   remotely. And so this PDA combination phone that's great and is
   convenient, it also can be a device depending on what you have in it
   that can be extracted remotely in a matter of nanoseconds.

<p> "Now, there are some business opportunities associated with this kind
   of espionage. You have lawyers who are more than willing to bring a
   lawsuit on behalf of shareholders or your partners or the company that
   you might be merging or acquiring for your breach of fiduciary duty to
   protect proprietary information. So you must take care. You are
   charged as a fiduciary with protecting proprietary information and you
   must personally undertake to make sure that you have all the proper
   barriers and the kind of protective techniques to protect that
   information. Otherwise you may find yourself subject to a lawsuit.

<p> "Secondly, there are insurance companies in their personal and
   commercial and industrial policies that are very careful to exclude
   any coverage for loss of IT information. They are more than happy to
   sell you additional policies to cover this sort of information,
   however. So there is another business opportunity there, but that's
   not the kind I think that you would like to promote.

<p> "So the question is these are the problems as we become more and more
   connected and wired together we become increasingly vulnerable to
   people who are pulling that information from our very midst. There is
   a two-edged sword of technology. You can have firewalls. You must
   erect firewalls to protect your information, but be careful. The
   people who may be marketing the firewalls may also have a trap door in
   the firewall so that they can pull all of the information out either
   for their companies or for their countries who may be sponsoring the
   companies who are selling the firewalls.

<p> "There is available exportable encryption public key infrastructure
   and so forth, but this technology really can't overcome faulty human
   beings who create these vulnerabilities so we need other things. We
   need to have effective information security policies, training and
   regular re-training because the technology is changing so rapidly
   we've got to constantly update our awareness of what is possible and
   what is potential.

<p> "We have to have effective early warning systems. The U.S. government
   does not do offensive warning as such. It will warn companies if they
   know they are being targeted. So if you are a U.S. company and you are
   being targeted by another intelligence service to gain information for
   proprietary information for your competition, they will alert you to
   this. They do not provide you with any information. So we have to have
   effective early warning systems, and the private sector should be
   willing to work more closely with the U.S. government. There is great
   reluctance on the part of the private sector to establish too much of
   a close relationship with the U.S. government. I think that's a
   mistake. But there is a lack of trust there that you're number one
   afraid to report that some of your systems either have been
   compromised, that you have been the subject of external attempts to
   penetrate your systems, that this information might somehow be
   disseminated in ways that would injure your company. But I believe
   that if you're going to have protection in the future, then we have to
   find ways of sharing information and setting up a trust relationship
   with various agencies within various departments in the U.S.
   government that can help you protect your proprietary information.

<p> "Because you bear liability, because you are held responsible, it is
   important that you not leave it simply to the hired help. It is
   important that your probe the security of your partners and your
   suppliers and people who you hire on a temporary basis. How many of
   you here have found the situation, I certainly have found it, that
   suddenly one of your key secretaries is out and you have a temporary
   that comes in. Who checks the background of the temporary? How much
   access does he or she have to your networking systems? You have got to
   adopt a very aggressive, affirmative duty to check all of this out.
   Otherwise, you open yourself up to the liability.

<p> "So outsourcing prudence, subject your contract and your temporary
   employees to the same personnel checks you would your permanent
   workforce, and be very, very careful and deliberate in deciding what
   access they have.

<p> "Finally, the public wake-up that needs to take place. I mentioned
   ASIS before. They surveyed companies who see foreign competitors,
   especially foreign intelligence services, as a low threat. The FBI
   reports nearly a quarter of economic espionage involved foreign
   nations and the threat is emanating from some 23 countries today.

<p> "So this is something. It is serious. It is growing. You should be
   aware of it. You should focus on it. The goal, of course, is to
   protect the mission. No system is foolproof. No human is faultless.
   Perfection is not the objective, but the objective is to protect the
   corporation's mission. And remember that includes protecting your
   partners and your customers.

<p> "There is a wonderful quote from T.S. Eliot. He asked the question
   where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge and where is the
   knowledge we have lost in information. And I would add to that where
   is the business we have lost in the information that's being stolen.
   
<p> "Thank you very much."
