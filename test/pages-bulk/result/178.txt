<p> " Everyone is unique. Thus, in a safe environment, I try to understand
   your particular dilemma and see the world through your eyes. My desire
   is to empower you to manifest your soul's fullest expression and
   achieve your goals in work, relationships and health. I treat marital
   or career problems, anxiety, depression, trauma, grief, chronic pain
   and illness. I work with those affected by abuse and addiction, and am
   familiar with 12-step Programs. Formerly a lawyer, I understand work
   pressures, and aid clients with career stress, goals, and transitions.
   I mediated divorces and resolved custody disputes in Conciliation
   Court.
   
<p> I try to adapt each session to your special needs. Utilizing dynamic
   dialogue and cognitive behavioral therapy, clients gain
   self-acceptance and understanding, catalysts for change. Sometimes I
   also use dream interpretation, visualization, gestalt, meditation and
   hypnosis. With chronic pain, I teach breath, touch and sound
   techniques to alleviate pain.
   
<p> In addition to my extensive training, I have years of experience
   related to spirituality and healing, and have helped many clients
   through trauma, spiritual and relationship crises, loss and illness. "
