<h> A Detailed Plan For Iraq?

<p> Throughout the campaign, the media have demanded that John Kerry
   detail a strategy for dealing with Iraq. Never mind that the situation
   has changed dramatically, month-by-month, throughout the campaign.
   Never mind that even if it were possible to propose a "perfect
   solution" for today's situation, that solution would be hopelessly
   out-of-date by January. Never mind that, no matter what the plan, the
   Bush Campaign would ridicule any element that it could not coopt.
   (That led to the recent pecularity, following Kerry's first clear
   speech on an Iraq plan, in which the unreflective Bush Campaign
   declared through parallel statements to the media, "His ideas are the
   same as ours" and "He's advocating 'defeat and retreat'".) Never mind
   that no similar demand has been made of the Bush Campaign.
   
<p> I'll give David Ignatius this much - at least he's breaking with the
   nonsensical pattern of demanding the challenger to outline precisely
   what he would do in Iraq while failing to make any similar demand of
   the Bush Campaign. But any person who can assert,

<p> The coming offensive in Fallujah could be the bloodiest combat that
     U.S. forces have faced yet in Iraq. Worse, it could push interim
     Prime Minister Ayad Allawi's fragile interim government toward the
     breaking point. One early warning sign was this week's comment by
     interim President Ghazi Yawar, a Sunni Muslim, criticizing recent
     U.S. airstrikes on Fallujah as "collective punishment." It was
     Yawar's threat to quit the interim government last April that
     helped halt the previous U.S. offensive in Fallujah.

<p> has to also know that a strategy for the present situation in Iraq,
   let alone an exit strategy, could be dramatically changed by the
   success or failure of such a venture - and that even a military
   success could result in a profound setback if it inspires the collapse
   of the Allawi government, broadens the "resistance", or prevents
   elections.
   
<p> Ignatius continues,

<p> If you try to put yourself in the boots of a U.S. soldier in Iraq,
     what you want to know from the candidates is: Can we win this
     thing, and if not, how can we get out? Unfortunately, the debate
     didn't really illuminate those essential questions. The most
     difficult days in Iraq may well lie ahead, but neither candidate
     has leveled with the country about how severe that test will be, or
     what fallback plans he has if his assumptions prove overly
     optimistic.

<p> The questions are not entirely unfair, but Ignatius again ignores the
   fact that what might work today might not work tomorrow, let alone
   next month. The answer to "can we win this thing" seemed a bit
   different when Bush was strutting beneath his "Mission Accomplished"
   banner than it does today - and the colossal mistakes made since that
   time make it much less likely that we will achieve the results we most
   desire. Then, "winning" was defined as creating a stable nation with a
   secular, democratic government. Today, "winning" seems to be defined
   as achieving stability, preventing civil war, and creating a
   government that is not hostile to western interests. Would Ignatius
   call a plan to achieve that end a plan for victory?
   
<p> Bush, the person in the best position to provide the type of answers
   Ignatius demands, won't provide them. His answers would be an
   admission of the failure of his central promises in the "liberation"
   of Iraq, and would also reveal that he has no "exit strategy". And his
   campaign can't simultaneously accuse Kerry of "defeat and retreat"
   while simultaneously proposing Bush's plan for doing precisely what he
   ridicules.
   
<p> Bush would love for Kerry to paint a strategic picture on Iraq that
   addresses the present realities. "See how negative and pessimistic he
   is. Defeat and retreat. He's setting back our interests in the
   region." Columnists like Ignatius need to place the onus on the Bush
   Administration to announce its plan - to which the Kerry camp could
   then be called upon to respond with what it would do differently. And
   Bush knows that had he clearly enunciated his plan for Iraq and "exit
   strategy", he would have had to update the plan so frequently as to be
   (in his parlance) the quintessential flip-flopper, or would have had
   to repeatedly admit failure. Or both.
   
<p> Perhaps, before being allowed to write columns like this, columnists
   like Ignatius should be required to propose their own plans to achieve
   victory in Iraq, and their ideas of a viable exit strategy. Perhaps
   such a demand would be the only thing that would wake them up to the
   realities of the situation, and why their demands are rather silly.

<h> Leading Them By The Nose....

<p> When I hear criticisms of Kerry as the Democratic candidate, I am
   often left wondering what it is that inspires those criticisms. That
   is, the speakers will declare something silly like, "Kerry doesn't
   excite me", or "He was picked because he was considered the most
   electable", as if... as if either statement has any significance, or
   as if parties should pick unelectable candidates. Or "Bush reminds me
   of a guy I'd drink a beer with", or "I like his swagger and confidence
   - he's like me" (which is pretty much what a blue collar attendee at a
   Nascar event said a few months back - as if Bush is anything like
   him). When you hear something more substantive, such as "Kerry
   flip-flops", and press for details, you're lucky if you get any. In my
   experience, pressing for details reveals these comments to be inspired
   not by the candidate, but by news coverage of supposed voter
   ambivalence and of the other side's attack ads.
   
<p> I am often left to wonder what these people want in a candidate. Whose
   idea is it that you should want a candidate you would drink a beer
   with, or that you shouldn't want a candidate who instead drinks wine
   and likes fancy food? Or that you should have an (unelectable)
   candidate who excites you, rather than a staid, intelligent, and
   competent candidate who seems, well, staid, intelligent, and competent
   instead of "exciting". The media, I suppose, started to buy into the
   packaging and selling of a candidate, over the substance and
   competence of a candidate, after the Nixon-Kennedy debates. So
   "Dukakis looks silly in that helmet"-type nonsense often becomes the
   media's central focus, as opposed to the candidates' positions on the
   issues. (The media's distractability was very well highlighted by
   their response to the "Swift Boat Liars" nonsense - and the effort of
   even the New York Times to blame a candidate for its poor work. Sure,
   Dukakis didn't have to put on the helmet and get into the tank, but
   was that really a story?)
   
<p> If you were "surprised" by John Kerry's performance at the first
   Presidential debate - which he is widely regarded as having "won" -
   here's some news for you: If you had been paying attention to the
   candidate as opposed to the spin, you wouldn't have been surprised.
   
<p> You want a candidate who thinks in simple terms and speaks in
   pre-packaged sound bites, instead of one who understands the world's
   complexities and whose comments reflect thought and abstraction?
   Perhaps, then, you should do us a favor and limit yourself to voting
   for the county dog catcher. If you want more from a candidate, stop
   regurgitating the media's latest spin, and start listening to what the
   candidates are actually saying.

<h> Party Affiliation & Polling

<p> Here's a real shock - USA Today presents a table demonstrating that
   when polls include disproportionate numbers of people from one party
   or the other, the results of the poll skew toward the overrepresented
   party. With all due respect to Gallup's rationalizations for releasing
   polls which overrepresent self-identified Republicans, I think critics
   do understand the science (or lack thereof) behind this type of
   polling.

<h> "Bad Baby" Cases

<p> That sounds a bit strange, right? Maybe it has something to do with a
   small child who won't behave? Actually, it's lingo that some lawyers
   use to describe malpractice cases involving birth injuries. Realizing
   that most professions at times use expressions that are a bit
   unseemly, I can't get used to that particular example.
   
<p> There are cases of obstetric malpractice which are truly appalling.
   But, as everybody knows, not all birth injuries are the fault of the
   doctor. And there is validity to complaints about lawsuits being filed
   over alleged birth injuries when causation can't be made more certain
   than a coin toss. Very few lawyers engage in this type of litigation -
   on the one hand, fortunately, there aren't that many cases to be
   litigated in any given state; on the other hand, it is far too costly
   a gamble for those who can't afford to specialize in this type of
   litigation. Very few attorneys can risk $100,000.00 or more in
   up-front costs on a coin toss. And, although doctors may argue
   otherwise, very few attorneys would want to engage in this type of
   practice.
   
<p> The way it works is this: there's a birth case, where the baby has a
   serious injury that might be a birth injury, or it might be a
   congenital disorder for which the doctor has no fault. The medical
   evidence is equivocal - so the defense hires "experts" who testify
   that it was congenital or was an unavoidable consequence of birth, and
   the plaintiff hires "experts" who argue that the injury was caused by
   medical malpractice. The same experts often make a very handsome
   living from their testimony alone, be it for the malpractice insurance
   carrier or the plaintiff. The jury is then asked to pick a side by a
   "preponderance of the evidence" - which is why I referenced the coin
   toss. Whether one side persuades the jury that the plaintiff only
   proved a 49% likelihood of malpractice or a 51% likelihood of
   malpractice may turn more on external factors - such as whether the
   defendant doctor seemed arrogant when he testified, or whether the
   plaintiff came across as a greedy opportunist - than on the evidence.
   
<p> If the lawyer wins one case out of two, the strategy is a big-time
   moneymaker.
   
<p> There's another side to this type of litigation. It is this paradigm
   which is used as the rationale for sweeping "tort reform" measures
   which are designed not to make the jury's fact-finding more accurate,
   or to prevent the filing of "frivolous suits", but which are aimed
   directly at the most seriously injured victims of malpractice. The cry
   is that "obstetricians and neurologists pay too much for malpractice
   insurance", with the illogic that this necessarily means that all
   doctors should thus receive broad protections from liability for their
   mistakes - no matter how egregious the physician's conduct, and no
   matter how severe the patient's injury.
   
<p> I'm all for hearing proposals from physicians on how to make the birth
   injury situation more fair. (Or, for that matter, the somewhat similar
   situation for neurosurgeons, who may end up being sued as the result
   of a horrific maloccurrence - a fancy word for a 'bad outcome' - from
   a high risk surgery, even in the absence of malpractice.) But when it
   comes to making the system better, doctors and their lobbyists are
   almost universally silent. They instead want to arbitrarily limit the
   damages received by the most seriously injured victims of malpractice,
   in the most meritorious of cases. That's at least as immoral as going
   to court on a coin toss over a "bad baby" case.

<h> Bad Coverage of Bad Polls

<p> As poor as U.S. news coverage can be of the important issues of the
   day, it perhaps isn't surprising that CNN's coverage is particularly
   bad when it turns its spotlight on itself. CJR Campaign Desk observes
   CNN's coverage of MoveOn's criticism of the methodology of recent
   CNN/Gallup polls:

<p> Anchor Judy Woodruff began by briefly outlining MoveOn's complaint:
     "[R]ecent polls have shown George W. Bush leading John Kerry and
     MoveOn.org claims Gallup's polling techniques exaggerate Republican
     support." Woodruff then gave Gallup editor-in-chief Frank Newport
     almost three minutes to respond, uninterrupted, to the charges.
     Naturally, Newport defended Gallup's methodology, but essentially
     asked viewers to take it on faith that he knows what he's doing.

<h> Afraid of Hardball Questions

<p> The Bush campaign can reasonably anticipate the type of softball
   questioning of past debates - but they apparently fear that hard
   questions might be posed by the guy at the other lectern, so....

<p> Still, officials of the debate commission said they were agreeing
     primarily to those things Mr. Bush's aides had emphasized as
     especially important to them: a strict time limit on candidate
     responses, an electronic warning when candidates exceed their
     speaking time that can be seen and heard by viewers at home, and a
     prohibition against the candidates' directly posing questions to
     each other.

<p> Gotta keep the ugly truths from being aired....

<h> Tax Returns as Public Information?

<p> In London's Guardian, a columnist notes that the rich are getting away
   with paying far less than their fair share of taxes, but that the
   country's politicians seem to have little interest in closing
   loopholes and creating a fairer system. (Sound familiar?)

<p> So, if the super-rich won't pay because no one's interested in
     making them pay, what on earth can be done? How can the public's
     interest in fair taxation be revived? How could the government find
     the courage to stop the tax cheats?

<p> I have a cruel and unusual proposal: everyone's tax returns should
     be published. If the teachers and dustmen of this country could see
     that certain multi-millionaires are paying less tax than they are,
     they'd be so angry that the government would surely be obliged to
     act.

<p> (I think the teachers and dustmen would first check the tax returns of
   their neighbors and supervisors, but the media would certainly go
   after controvercial public figures and politicians.... But most people
   would probably be very uncomfortable with the disclosure of their
   personal financial information.)

<h> Common Sense, Ohio Style?

<p> The Dayton for Kerry website has reproduced an article (PDF format)
   describing how Ohio's Secretary of State, J. Kenneth Blackwell, has
   declared that counties must ignore voter registration cards submitted
   on paper stock of less than 80# weight.

<p> The requirement is because the forms are designed to be mailed like
     post-cards and must be thick enough to survive mechanical sorters
     at the U.S. Post Office, according to Blackwell's spokesman Carlo
     LoParo.
	 
<p> "Our directive stands and it is specifically in place to protect
     new registrants to make sure the forms are not destroyed," LoParo
     said.

<p> Yes, you heard that right. In order to protect registrants from having
   their registration forms destroyed in the mail, those which arrive
   intact but aren't on sufficiently thick paper stock are to be
   discarded.
   
<p> To make sure that this new ruling is fair and consistent in its
   application, Blackwell has exempted Cuyahoga County from the rule, and
   has additionally declared that registration forms downloaded from the
   federal Elections Assistance Agency must be accepted regardless of the
   paper they are printed on.

<h> Suicide

<p> It can be difficult to mark the moment when self-confidence turns into
   gradiosity, or when a suspicious nature turns into paranoia,
   particularly in someone you see regularly. But when you speak with
   somebody only a few times a year, the progression is more marked.
   
<p> When we lived in the same community, I knew somebody who would at
   times share theories of conspiracies which were, for the most part,
   plausible but unlikely. He was an intelligent professional, and he
   spun a lot of fact into his stories.
   
<p> At some point, his theories became far more involved and personal. He
   became deeply wedded to the notion of a conspiracy reaching to the
   highest levels of government, in which he was the target of a range of
   efforts to discredit him or to have him killed, because the nation's
   most powerful people were afraid of what would happen if the world
   found out what he knew.
   
<p> I wonder if there was more that could be done to help, but at the same
   time recognize that every effort to provide assistance was greeted
   with suspicion, and that the more aggressive efforts at intervention
   inspired new conspiracy theories, with those attempting to help
   transformed into villains trying to destroy him. There was no chance
   of getting court intervention, as he gave no evidence of being a
   danger to himself or others, and was quite rational when addressing
   issues other than his paranoid fantasies.
   
<p> The most aggressive effort at intervention, which pressured him to
   seek voluntary, intensive psychiatric care or possibly lose his
   professional license, backfired. He put himself beyond the reach of
   everybody who wanted to help him, and was largely isolated for the
   past year. He contacted me every few months, and we even discussed on
   a few occasions how I might be able to help him, but unfortunately he
   didn't follow through. A couple of times I must have pressed too hard,
   as I received emails indicating that I was forgiven (for whatever it
   was that I had been perceived to have done), but that he knew that I
   was nonetheless "one of the good guys".)
   
<p> I hadn't heard from him for quite a few months, then learned of is
   death through the proverbial grapevine. I can't say that I am
   surprised at this outcome, but I am saddened.
