<h> Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Testing Requirementsfor Entry into
Foreign Countries

<h> March 2006

<p> An increasing number of countries require that foreigners be tested
   for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) prior to entry.  It is usually
   required as part of a medical exam for long-term visitors, i.e.
   students and workers.  The following list of country requirements is
   based on information available as of March 2006 and is subject to
   change.  Before traveling abroad, check with the embassy of the
   country to be visited to learn about entry requirements and
   specifically whether AIDS testing is a requirement.  If the list
   indicates U.S. test results are acceptable and the word "Yes" appears
   with an asterisk beside it  (Yes*) in a particular country,
   prospective travelers should inquire at the embassy of that country
   for details (e.g. which laboratories in the United States may perform
   tests and where to have results certified and authenticated) before
   departing the United States.
