<h> Term "Wife Beater" Gains Acceptance

<p> I have never liked calling white t-shirts "wife beaters" for obvious
   reasons. I've heard too many teenaged boys use the term, and think
   that it's cool. Unfortunately, Ms. Musings reports that the word has
   been accepted into the Oxford English Dictionary. Here is what Alison
   Ward of the Star Telegraph has to say about it:

<p> For at least three decades, the controversial term has been used to
   describe the ribbed tank top made famous by violent movie stereotypes
   and the Fox show Cops. Men who beat their wives, the thinking goes,
   like to spend their spare time drinking beer in thin white
   undershirts.

<p> The shirt has traveled far beyond its blue-collar roots; celebs have
   made it sexy. Paris Hilton wears hers with itty-bitty skirts. It's
   hard to spot Eminem or Kevin Federline (Britney Spears' husband)
   without one. "Most nights I end up wearing a wife-beater T-shirt and
   boxers," Jessica Alba told the leering men's mag Maxim.

<p> Newspapers have been claiming since 2003 that "wife-beater's"
   inclusion in the OED is imminent. But in its February issue, GQ -- a
   magazine that oughta know its men's fashion terms -- swears the word
   will be added next month in the OED's quarterly online update.

<p> Jesse Sheidlower, the OED's North American editor at large, confirms
   this. Well, sort of.

<p> "It's very likely that this is going to appear," he says.

<p> Sheidlower says the dictionary accepts about 250 new words per
   quarter. The third printed edition of the mammoth OED won't be
   published for several more years, but the online version -- available
   by subscription -- serves as an official, ever-expanding substitute in
   the meantime.

<p> So what makes "wife-beater" a contender? "If something is really
   common and relatively widespread, it's likely to go in," Sheidlower
   says.

<p> Is this were Rove got his idea -- keep saying the lies until people
   believe them?

<p> I've never used that term myself.

<p> I used to know a guy who used to call handlebar mustaches "wife beater
   mustaches". And it was odd because after I heard him say that, I
   actually saw 2 tv shows about men who abused their spouses - and both
   had handlebar mustaches. (One show was "Walker Texas Ranger", of
   course. haha. This was years ago, mind you.)

<p> What I want to know, is yeah - why would someone proudly want to wear
   something called "wife beater"? Seems to me people who like those
   t-shirts (or those mustaches for that matter) should vehemently object
   to the term.

<p> Well maybe this is a GOOD thing.

<p> It will encourage the men in the target group to look twice at their
   own behavior and maybe embarrass them enough to change it.

<p> I first heard the word "wife-beater" used in reference to white
   undershirts/tank tops when I was working at a gap outlet store and
   some guy came in asking if we had "wife-beaters."

<p> I gave him a confused look and politely asked him to repeat the
   question because I was sure I had misheard him. Once he said it again
   and I knew I heard correctly I just gaped at him...and pretended to
   misunderstand what he was asking for when he pointed to his own white
   undershirt.

<p> It wasn't until his girlfriend stepped in and specifically said "white
   tank tops" that I politely said "no, we don't carry any mens tank tops
   in the winter."

<p> Trish: Sorry about the multiple ping on the trackback. Would
   appreciate your comments at my post on the commercial angle of this
   guy who sells these tee shirts with the logos Wife beater on them. If
   your regular readers are offended by this guy (and I suspect they will
   be), comments can be addressed to:
   bruised@wife-beaters.com

<p> WTF. Unbelievable

<p> Thanks for the email link to the wifebeaters site. I've seen that site
   before, and it's nauseating. And it's okay that you pinged me a few
   times. Typepad burped on me a little while ago, and I think that's
   probably why your trackbacks came up more than once.

<p> I was talking about this with a friend... And the people we've known
   who've used the term have used it with disdainful irony. In that they
   would never wear an UNDER shirt in a public setting.

<p> Of course I think that's how they got the term, because on those cop
   shows, they show up at the people's private residences when there's a
   domestic violence incident.

<p> Though I still don't know why someone would wear a white undershirt to
   the mall to go shopping at The Gap. LOL.
   Why not just go there in your boxers already? How 'bout in just a bra.
   ick.
