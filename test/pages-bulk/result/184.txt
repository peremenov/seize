<h> SCREEN by Edward Floren

<p> For a rookie outing, Screen really isn't too bad. That is, of course,
   if it's really a rookie outing. In the comp you can never really be
   sure that anything is what it appears to be, and for all I know
   "Edward Floren" is a pseudonym for somebody who's released a
   half-dozen games. But I don't think so. There are a number of errors
   that experienced Inform coders are less likely to make, such as "You
   have so far scored 0 out of a possible 0, in 36 turns" in response to
   SCORE. The more familiar you are with Inform, the more likely you have
   encountered Andrew Plotkin's web page of tips and tricks that gives
   the solution to eliminating this untidy message, or for that matter
   figured out how to eliminate it yourself. For another thing, there's
   the fact that although there are plenty of scenery objects (and I know
   this because typing GET ALL listed them out -- another rookie
   mistake), many of them aren't implemented at all. It doesn't take very
   many "You see nothing special about the <whatever>" messages for
   immersion to fall by the wayside. On the other hand, some other
   aspects of the game are coded rather nicely, such as the custom
   cant_go messages and the room descriptions that change depending on
   whether you're seeing the room for the first time or not.

<p> The prose quality is a similarly mixed bag. Much of the writing
   successfully evokes a sweet nostalgia as it depicts Jordan the PC's
   return to the scene of his childhood games. Riffs on Baby Boomer pop
   culture are handled lovingly, with a light enough touch to let them
   feel touching without being cloying. On the down side, this game would
   definitely have benefited from another round of proofreading. Consider
   the flashback to Jordan's first kiss, where he stares at the girl he
   likes and the narrator tells us, "She looked so sweat." This is one of
   the worst sorts of English errors to have in the public release of
   your game -- not only does it miss its intended meaning, but in fact
   it squarely hits another meaning entirely, and a rather comical one at
   that. Certainly it's an understandable error -- it's only one letter
   off the correct spelling, and could even be a typo, and for that
   matter "neat" and "beat" have the intended phoneme. Then again, the
   word "sweating" is used only three sentences later, which makes the
   error a little less understandable. In any case, it's a bad, bad
   mistake that entirely punctures the otherwise poignant scene. And lest
   it seem that I'm pouncing on the whole game for one little mistake, I
   hasten to add that little errors like this (though none worse than
   that) are present throughout the game, and should have been eliminated
   before its release.

<p> The prose errors didn't stop me from enjoying the game overall,
   though. For the most part, it's a short and sweet little romp through
   childhood memories and favorite TV shows. The puzzles, too, are mostly
   straightforward, though I was unfortunate enough to trip repeatedly on
   a rather tightly timed puzzle towards the game's end. The problem
   there was that although I had figured out the elements of the puzzle,
   the solution required an extra step that, as near as I can tell, was
   completely unclued. Dear me, every time I start to praise this game I
   end up criticizing it. Overall, Screen is a nicely sketched vignette.
   Even if it feels rather aimless and disjointed at times (man, there I
   go again!), I didn't want my 45 minutes back after I finished it. It's
   a nice start at the IF craft, and I look forward to the author's next
   work.

<h> A PARTY TO MURDER by David Good

<p> I will say this for it: A Party To Murder is the best ADRIFT game I've
   ever played. Unfortunately, that's not saying much. Even if it were
   written in a first-tier IF language, APTM would have some problems to
   overcome, but as it is, it's hopelessly lumbered by the terrible,
   terrible ADRIFT parser. We're talking about a mystery game here,
   reminiscent of Suspect -- you play a guest at a party where a murder
   is discovered, and you must extricate yourself from suspicion. A
   mystery game, okay? You might think that, in a mystery game, you'd be
   able to SEARCH things. Not this one -- it doesn't recognize SEARCH,
   LOOK IN, or LOOK THROUGH. Worse, with the latter two it parses them as
   LOOK rather than just admitting that it doesn't recognize them. Same
   with LOOK UNDER and LOOK BEHIND. Hint: ignoring prepositions doesn't
   make them go away, it just makes your response more likely to be
   wrong. Perhaps, in a mystery game, you might want to SHOW things to
   NPCs. You can't here. Even if you hold a completely damning piece of
   evidence and want to show it to the person whom it damns, all you get
   from the ADRIFT parser is "I don't understand what you want me to do
   with the letter." Maybe, in a mystery game, you might even want to
   TELL someone about something. In this game, you can't. All these very
   basic verbs, absolutely standard with any first-tier system, are
   unavailable in ADRIFT, and their absence absolutely slaughters this
   game. In fact, from a very early stage, whenever I encountered one of
   the game's many containers, I got in the habit of trying to GET ALL
   FROM it, because that was the only reliable way I could get the game
   to tell me whether there was anything inside. Needless to say, I
   wasn't exactly feeling immersed in the story while doing so.

<p> As I said above, even if all these problems were resolved, APTM still
   wouldn't be a great game. Part of the reason for this is the fact that
   the game seems to operate on its own inscrutable logic rather than any
   sort of recognizable sense of cause-and-effect. For instance, there's
   a portion of the game where access to a useful item is being
   controlled by one of the NPCs. The only way to persuade this NPC to
   let you have the object is to perform a long series of apparently
   arbitrary tasks, and the NPC doesn't really indicate that it wants
   these tasks performed. The only way I found out was via the
   walkthrough, and I'd be surprised if anybody figured it out any other
   way. Of course, by that time I was going straight from the walkthrough
   anyway, because in my initial playthrough of the game, I never found
   that NPC at all -- it seems she only appears after a particular item
   has been discovered, even though that item is more or less unrelated
   to her absence. Oh, and that item is only accessible by using an
   object whose primary logical use is unimplemented in the game. For the
   sake of spoilers, I won't name what that object is, but just for
   example, if you found a knife, and the game didn't understand the word
   CUT, you might think that knife was a red herring (and that the game
   was lazily implemented). Wouldn't you be surprised to find out from
   the walkthrough that even though CUT isn't implemented, you still need
   the knife to, oh I don't know, scrape the mud off a stone tablet or
   something? Something analogous occurs in this game. See what I mean
   about inscrutable logic? In addition to logic problems, there are
   certain implementation errors as well. For example, most of the game
   consists of a flashback, but typing X ME while still in the frame
   story depicts the PC as if the flashback was already happening.

<p> So after all this, what makes APTM the best ADRIFT game I've ever
   played? Well, for one thing, despite the occasional glitch, it does
   have a decent depth of implementation. Most first-level nouns are
   described, and the setting is rather richly detailed. I spent an
   inordinate number of hours with Suspect when I was younger, and at
   times this game brought back pleasant memories of that experience. The
   writing gets its job done with a minimum of errors, and the NPCs are
   coded to handle a reasonable number of inquiries. In fact, a couple of
   times during the game I asked an NPC about a somewhat extraneous
   topic, and was happily surprised to discover that the response had
   been implemented. Another point in favor of the NPCs is that they will
   sometimes react sensibly to strange actions on the player's part; for
   instance, walking into the teenage daughter's bedroom while she's
   making out with the neighbor elicits angry responses from both of
   them, escalating in intensity the longer the PC hangs around. Snooping
   around the objects in the house, though it's necessary, also provokes
   suspicion from some of the NPCs. Then again, nobody gives you a second
   glance when you walk through the house carrying an 8-foot ladder, so
   this realistic implementation is really rather patchy. Overall, APTM
   would be a seaworthy craft, but between the logic holes in its hull
   and the tsunamis of ADRIFT inadequacy, it sinks dismally fast.

<h> RAMON AND JONATHAN by Daniele A. Gewurz

<p> Since classical times, stories have opened "in medias res." This
   phrase, Latin for "in the middle of things", refers to a narrative
   that begins during some crucial piece of action, filling in the
   background and the preceding events sometime later. Ramon and Jonathan
   fulfills the former part of this bargain, but never the latter. The
   game drops us into some sort of science-fictional scenario where some
   (maybe) criminals are being exonerated, or extradited, or something,
   and suggests that we're not happy with the situation. Then there's an
   unintuitive door-opening puzzle, a bit of quick noun-guessing with an
   NPC, and then it's over. We never learn the backstory behind who did
   what to whom and why, who lives on what planet and how they got there,
   or who any of these characters even are. Because the first (and really
   only) puzzle didn't make any sense to me, I turned to the walkthrough
   in record time, but even after I had walked through the game, I still
   didn't really get it. As I always say in these situations, that may be
   because I'm dense, but egomaniac that I am, I'm more inclined to
   believe that the game did an insufficient job of explaining itself.

<p> Not helping matters was the fact that the prose is written in
   not-quite-fluent English. It's not terrible, mind you -- many of the
   sentences pass muster without a problem, but those that don't are
   really jarring. For instance:
   >x people
   The audience has been waiting for years this moment, and is mostly
   greatly disappointed for the two "hangmen" to have been virtually
   cleared. Everybody rumble and yell.

<p> The first sentence is almost up to snuff, if only "years" and "for"
   exchanged places -- it would still sound awkward and clunky after
   that, but would at least be grammatically correct. The second sentence
   sounds stereotypically, almost laughably wrong, as if it were written
   for a Bronson Pinchot character. You know, I've said this before: I
   don't care whether English is your first language or not, but I do
   care about fluency and readability. If you can't write fluent English,
   either don't write a text adventure in English or make sure to have
   your text adventure thoroughly proofed and corrected before inflicting
   it on the world. I don't mean to sound harsh, but if you want to
   produce something good, you simply must make sure the writing works.

<p> It's also a good idea to fully implement everything you put in your
   game. Ramon And Jonathan, short though it is, is poorly equipped to
   handle any deviation from its plotline. Anything outside the bounds of
   the walkthrough is handled in one of two ways. The first method is
   simply to end the game. This happened to me on my first half-dozen
   playthroughs -- either because I walked in a disallowed direction or
   because I failed to solve the timed puzzle, the game abruptly kicked
   me to the curb and told me to restore or restart. Restarting wasn't
   terrible, because I'd invariably just played a few moves anyway, but
   the frequency of the situation made it clear that there wasn't much
   room to wander. The other, much worse method that the game uses to
   handle players that leave the path is to simply do nothing. At one
   point, I wandered into a room with no less than five NPCs, all of whom
   may as well have been statues for all that they responded to me.
   Eventually I figured out I must be doing something wrong because my
   current situation was so amazingly dull. This does not make for a fun
   game -- utter boredom shouldn't be the tool that forces players to
   comply with the plot. So finally, I restarted, hit the walkthrough,
   made the required twenty moves, and the game ended. Or rather, if an
   ending implies that everything has been tied up and some sort of
   dramatic conclusion has been reached, it's probably more accurate to
   say the game stopped.

<h> ERIC'S GIFT by Joao Mendes

<p> In the "about" text for Eric's Gift, the author mentions that much of
   the inspiration for the story came from a dream. Somehow, this seems
   appropriate, because the experience of playing the game was quite
   reminiscent of a recurring dream of mine: the one where I find myself
   in a play, but I don't know my character or any of my lines. The other
   actors look at me expectantly, waiting for me to say the words that
   will advance the plot, and all I can do is madly improvise in a futile
   attempt to hit on the right topic. Eric's Gift is one of those games
   that runs on triggers -- examining a particular thing, or asking about
   a particular subject, or performing some other action triggers a
   non-interactive cutscene, which changes the PC's location and moves
   the plot along. When games like this work, they give the feeling of a
   story advancing smoothly, right in sync with the player's actions.
   When one breaks down, though, it's hell -- players flounder about
   looking for the right action as the plot's momentum evaporates, along
   with the fun of the game. Rather than guess-the-verb or
   guess-the-noun, the whole thing becomes a game of guess-the-trigger,
   which is worse than either one, since it encompasses both verbs and
   nouns, but you can never be sure which you're trying to guess at any
   given moment. That's just what happened to me in Eric's Gift. I was in
   a conversation scene where, unbeknownst to me, I needed to examine a
   sub-object of an object (that is to say, a second-level noun) in order
   to trigger the next scene. Thinking I'd examined everything, and
   having tried to leave, or do various other more or less appropriate
   actions, I kept fishing for new things to ask about, feeling like one
   of those characters in Sartre's No Exit, doomed to spend all eternity
   trapped with the same annoying person.

<p> In a situation like this, it really helps a lot if the game is
   thoroughly implemented, and in part, Eric's Gift accomplishes this.
   All available scenery objects are described, and a few
   off-the-beaten-path conversation topics are implemented, too. However,
   as time wore on and I kept not guessing the trigger, the NPC began to
   feel more and more threadbare, always failing to respond to my
   increasingly desperate topic choices. Perhaps part of my problem was
   that I was a bit distracted by the game's insistent use of the same
   metaphor over and over and OVER again. Saying that a woman has a
   "light in her eyes" is already a bit of a clichÃ©, but quite tolerable
   if said once, maybe even twice. This game hits it so often that it
   becomes comical. My breaking point was when I encountered this
   description: "Her eyes shine with a light of their own, with an
   intensity that almost blinds you." Mind you, there had already been
   many repetitions of the "light in the eyes" theme, but this one was
   way, way over the top. How could the light in someone's eyes, which I
   take to mean an animated, vivacious expression, almost blind me? I
   couldn't help but picture the NPC with high-beam headlights for eyes,
   the PC shielding his face from the glare. The lesson here is that any
   given metaphor is best used sparingly -- the more often we see it, the
   less effective it becomes.

<p> My other issue with Eric's Gift is that it is pointlessly
   science-fictional. What I mean by that is that although the story is
   set in the future, it gains virtually nothing thereby. A few details
   are changed here and there -- people drink "synthcaf" instead of
   coffee, the TV is called a "tri-di", and so forth -- but otherwise the
   story might just as well be set in 2002. Not one significant point of
   plot or character derives from the futuristic setting, and
   consequently that setting is little more than a distraction. Adding a
   science-fictional sheen to an otherwise mundane story doesn't somehow
   make that story cooler. Quite the contrary, in fact -- it drains the
   story of mainstream appeal while gaining nothing in sf credibility.
   Oh, and one more thing: there are serious logical holes in the plot,
   especially in the defining element of the plot. Although its writing
   and coding was competent, the logical flaws, awkward emotion, and
   frustrating design make Eric's Gift one that I won't be keeping.

<h> JANE by Joseph Grzesiak

<h> Note: Because strong language and themes of domestic abuse appear in
   this game, they will also appear in this review.

<p> A couple of years ago, I released a game with some pretty intense
   themes, including rape, murder, and slavery. Aside from whatever other
   ways my game succeeded or failed, people's reactions to encountering
   this sort of thing in a work of IF varied a lot. Some people really
   appreciated it, others... not so much. One player rather memorably
   described it this way: "After playing, my head felt like someone had
   been hitting it very hard with a solid metal thing." After playing
   this game, I understand a little more where that guy was coming from.
   Jane takes on the topic of wife-beating, portraying it from the
   perspective of the victim, the abuser, and a few others besides. The
   experience of playing through a story in IF form, as opposed to
   reading it on the page, really intensifies my identification with the
   characters, and there were moments during my time with Jane that I
   started feeling physically ill, and dirty, involved in something I did
   not wish to be a part of. I don't mean to sound disapproving -- those
   moments were quite powerful and dramatic, and the game did give a
   clear warning about its subject matter before it began. Indeed, the
   times when I was feeling the most upset were when I was admiring Jane
   the most; its writing and its implementation occasionally managed to
   affect me quite strongly.

<p> On the other hand, that effect was only occasional, for several
   reasons. First of all, though I applaud it for its ambition in getting
   inside the heads of abuser, victim, and onlookers, the
   characterization frequently fell a bit flat for me. The dialogue and
   actions of the characters sometimes rang quite true, but other times
   felt fairly stock, as if pulled from one of those movies that always
   seem to be running on the Lifetime channel. Another, more severe issue
   is that presenting a story like this interactively is a major
   challenge, and the game wasn't always prepared to meet that challenge.
   At its worst moments, the clash between the intense action of the
   story and the standard Inform library responses evoked by my actions
   was outright comical, completely defeating the drama:
   
<l> "You'd have nothing!" he shouts, continuing his rant. "No one would
   ever want you. You're of no use to anyone. You'd be nothing."

<l> >get vase
   That's hardly portable.

<l> John's lost in his mind again. "You ARE nothing!" he shouts again. He
   steps forward quickly and shoves you back, causing you to stumble to
   keep your balance. "You're useless! You're so fucking useless!"

<l> >push john
   That would be less than courteous.

<p> Those library messages, quite suitable in the majority of IF
   situations, are laughably inappropriate here, and either the author or
   the testers should have caught them. The debugging verbs should also
   have been turned off -- the effect of these things together was that
   Jane had a fairly rushed feel. Even more damaging, by failing to
   account for fairly reasonable actions, the game makes itself too
   vulnerable to ridiculousness, which is poison to the kind of tragic
   storytelling it attempts.

<p> Even when it does properly account for the player's input, though,
   Jane usually feels quite straitjacketed. In fact, although the game
   borrows heavily from Photopia by using multiple perspectives (albeit a
   chronologically intact story) and a virtually identical approach to
   conversation, it reminded me less of Photopia than of Rameses.
   Unfortunately, it wasn't the brilliant subversion of IF and
   storytelling that Rameses was, both because that game arrived first
   and because in its very use of multiple viewpoints and linear
   chronology, Jane dilutes the best rationale for its linearity. I can
   see a viable argument that Jane (the NPC, not the game), and perhaps
   even her abusive husband, should present few real options to the
   player. They're locked into the cycle of abuse, and the player's
   frustration could mirror that of the characters as they try and fail
   to break out of their long-established patterns. However, that's far
   less true for other characters, who lack such a reason for being bound
   to any particular course of action. In addition, as the intensity of
   the rising action builds, the characters should have more freedom
   available, as desperate measures become more and more plausible. Since
   I experienced the story in accurate chronological order, I expected
   that at some point I'd be able to find my own way out of the ugly
   tangle of that relationship. Instead, what I found was that I had to
   follow the game's singular path through it, and that meant enduring
   just as much abuse as the game decided it ought to commit. In my own
   way, I felt a little battered by the time I finished. I did finish,
   though. I didn't quit. I guess I was asking for it.

<h> CONSTRAINTS by Martin Bays

<p> I'm far from the first person to make this claim, but I think every
   piece of art is, to some greater or lesser degree, about the art form
   itself. Every novel is at least a little bit about the novel, every
   film is at least a little bit about the cinema. And every text game is
   at least a little bit about IF itself. Then there are those that are
   very much about the form. Constraints is one of these. It disarmed me
   by admitting upfront, in fact brandishing, the fact that it was going
   to consist of constrained interactions. It then sets out to explore
   not only the idea of constraint, and the ways that interaction in a
   text game can be constrained, but how to make those constrained
   interactions effective, and even fun. Of course, it's not the first
   game to tread this ground -- Photopia and Rameses have famously drawn
   from the same well -- but it's the first one I've seen that devotes
   itself so purely to the concept, free of any particular narrative or
   character. However, because of the way it's structured, it's rather
   difficult to talk about without giving too much away. What I can say,
   though, is that although at one point it enumerates the types of
   constraints it claims to employ, there is one that it doesn't include
   in its list but which features prominently throughout the game.

<p> I'm referring to the fact that although you have the opportunity to
   play several characters in Constraints (all of whom are in some
   restricted situation, natch), they all share a common trait: the
   desire not to be constrained. In each scenario, I struggled for a bit
   against the circumstances, but then tried doing things that would
   indicate a certain peace with the situation. Each time, I was
   rebuffed, instructed that the character's desire outweighed whatever
   notions I might have about graceful acceptance. I'm not complaining
   about this. It's quite legitimate to instruct a player about how to
   behave in character when a character is specified, and in a game this
   skillfully done, I wouldn't be at all surprised if the additional
   level of constraint was quite intentional. The idea intrigues me,
   though. How much of what we call constraints in our lives are simply
   produced by our own desires, more or less independent of our
   circumstances? When we feel held down, held back, would the feeling
   disappear if we decided that we no longer wanted whatever lay on the
   other side of the barrier? For that matter, can a constraint even
   exist without a corresponding desire to define it as such? In this
   game, the question is moot -- there's no way of changing the
   characters' desires -- but I really like it that the experience of
   playing made me think about such a philosophical issue in my own life.

<p> It helps a lot that Constraints is quite exquisitely implemented. It's
   clear that this game has been tested thoroughly -- not only did I find
   no bugs, but several times throughout the game, I had the exciting
   experience of trying a fairly unusual action, and seeing that the game
   anticipated it and handled it expertly. The game uses the z-machine's
   color capabilities quite nicely (thereby giving me another reason to
   be thankful to David Kinder for the new WinFrotz 2002 interpreter),
   and in another section commits an impressive (though not quite
   unprecedented) z-machine abuse. For the most part, the writing hews to
   the same high standard, though there are several instances of rather
   strange word choices. I'm not sure whether these were simply typos, or
   whether they indicate that perhaps English isn't the author's first
   language. If the latter is true, then Constraints is to be commended
   all the more for the level of mastery it does attain. Despite all
   this, I can't quite bring myself to rate the game a 10. Even though it
   was thought-provoking and nicely crafted, in the end I didn't find it
   terribly enjoyable; I don't really like being constrained.
   Nevertheless, this is an excellent work of IF, and a fascinating
   metatreatise on "puzzleless" IF in general.
