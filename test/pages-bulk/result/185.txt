<h> FOYLE FRIEND SCHOOL SURVEY

<h> THE COMING OUT PROCESS

<p> Identifying oneself as lesbian or gay and disclosing this to other
   people is often referred to as 'Coming Out'.  There are three main
   issues associated with coming out which schools need to be aware of:

<l> 'Coming out' is a necessary and ultimately positive
   experience for most young people who grow up lesbian or gay.  It can
   take place in the years between starting and leaving secondary school.
   In this period, coming to terms with confusion about identity can
   affect a young person's social relationships, school work and
   self-esteem both negatively and positively. 

<l> Many young lesbian and gay people experience critical times
   when they have to decide who to tell about their sexuality.  In making
   this disclosure they are often fearful of negative reactions,
   rejection and causing upset and distress to the person they are
   telling.  Sometimes a young person may try 'coming out' to a
   supportive teacher or a school friend as a precursor to talking to
   parents in order to rehearse their own part and to judge reactions.
   Receiving a negative reaction can be very distressing. 

<l> Support and guarantees of safety are valuable to young people
   'coming out'.  The availability of secure and confidential groups or
   contacts can be instrumental in reducing anxiety which is only
   magnified by feelings of isolation.  The presence of role models in
   the shape of adults who 'come out' and those who offer non-judgmental
   support and help young people access these groups can be important.
   Positive treatment by, and contact with, role models can also
   encourage them to feel confident about their future. 

<p> There are several theories about the elements of the 'coming out'
   process.  Each has its own emphasis but all of them regard 'coming
   out' as a series of stages.  These stages do not necessarily last the
   same length of time and there is no one age when the whole process
   begins and ends.  These stages can be described as follows:

<h> Stage 1 - Sensitisation 

<p> G9 said  "I was probably always a loner anyway, afraid to let anyone
   `in', so I was a bit of an oddity among my contemporaries anyway."

<p> Andrew said "Only now do I realise the level of harassment, bullying
   and mental torture that I endured while at school.  I was never like
   all the other boys, always excluded from all the social activities
   that the majority enjoyed.  For years I pondered as to why this was.
   Why was I being treated differently and castigated by others to such a
   lonely life?"

<p> In this stage a person generally begins to feel 'different' to other
   people of the same sex.  Sometimes they recognise that they are not
   very interested in people of the opposite sex but more often they feel
   they are not really interested in things which are supposed to be
   appropriate for their sex.  Most people report just feeling unusual
   when they compare themselves to other people of their sex.  Commonly
   this happens before or in early adolescence when friendships and
   relationships between the sexes begin to change.

<p> Roughly half the LGB men and women surveyed felt 'different' by the
   age of 11.

<h> Stage 2 - Confusion about identity 

<p> G28 said  "I tried not to think about it as I felt disgusted and
   repulsed if I dared think of fellow class-mates in a sexual way.  I
   shuddered at the thought of them discovering how I felt and thought so
   I never really thought of being a gay person at school due to the fact
   that I pretended to be 'straight' .  Therefore, being gay at school is
   a life of pretence, lies and denial.  Living in fear of being
   discovered due to the ensuing consequences."

<p> There are usually four elements which contribute to confusion about
   identity:

<l> Feeling that perceptions of the self are altering; 

<l> Feeling and experiencing heterosexual and homosexual sexual
   arousal; 

<l> Sensing the stigma surrounding homosexuality; 

<l> Lacking knowledge about homosexuality.  

<p> Research indicates that most young gay men first decide they are
   probably gay between the ages of 12 and 17, and most young lesbian
   women first decide they are probably lesbian between the ages of 16
   and 20. At this time they have to deal with feeling that they have
   changed as have their relationships with other people around them.
   Some also have to combat the potentially powerful feelings of
   self-recrimination and disgust that come from describing themselves as
   homosexual.  There are various strategies for coping with this
   emotional upheaval.

<p> Some young people who think they are lesbian or gay will try to deny
   it to themselves and even seek help to eradicate their feelings.
   Others will try and avoid thoughts and feelings which remind them that
   they have homosexual inclinations.  In these situations young people
   can avoid getting any information about sexuality in order to avoid
   confirming their suspicions about their orientation.

<p> Some young people have great difficulty in managing their
   relationships with peers and family.  They may avoid situations in
   which they may encounter opportunities for heterosexual pairing so
   that they are not forced to deal with their lack of sexual interest in
   members of the opposite sex or have it exposed.  They may,
   alternatively, persevere with heterosexual relationships to try and
   'convert' themselves and/or conceal their homosexuality from others.
   In some extreme cases young people may try to avoid confronting their
   feelings by expressing strong homophobia or turning to drink and drugs
   in order to find temporary relief from them.

<p> Finally, some young people fall back on a strategy of redefining their
   feelings and behaviour in such a way as to convince themselves that it
   is not really homosexual.  For example, they may describe their
   experiences as a 'phase' or a 'one-off' or they may put them down to
   extreme emotional or physical circumstances such as the break-up of a
   relationship or drunkenness at a party. In this stage feelings are
   becoming more concrete.  Young people may well have partners of both
   sexes and may well find their moods and feelings shifting as they feel
   more or less certain about their identity.  This period often lasts
   throughout adolescence.

<p> It is important to note that 50% of gay and bisexual boys surveyed
   knew they were gay by 11Â¼ and of lesbian and bisexual girls by 12Â¼.
   By 13, 80% of lesbian and bisexual girls are aware that they are gay
   and by 15, 80% of gay and bisexual boys are aware that they are gay.  

<l> Most children who later self-identify as gay/bisexual are well aware
   that they are gay by NI school year 11 (14/15) 

<l> Many are aware they are gay in NI school year 8 (11/12)!

<l> By sixth form practically all gay people know they are gay

<h> Stage 3 - Assuming a lesbian or gay identity 

<p> L10 said "I never felt so bad about not finding men attractive in the
   true sense of the word and it helped me understand why I felt like I
   did for women so it was no longer un-natural."

<p> G26 said "I was happy to like other boys and sensed that the one boy I
   fancied was gay as I could feel that he was interested in me by way of
   glances and once standing up for me when I was picked on."

<p> Clearly, living with confusion about identity is emotionally
   exhausting and potentially destructive.  For some young people this
   period is followed quite quickly by a stage in which they come to
   accept their lesbian or gay identity and are able to express it in a
   positive way.  For both young men and women growing up mixing with
   other young gay people - in social settings or through support groups
   - can help them feel able accept to who they are.  For some young
   people, particularly in larger towns and cities, lesbian and gay youth
   support groups provide a safe environment for 'coming out'.  Elsewhere
   local and national lesbian and gay telephone helplines provide a safe
   space and listening ear for young people who want support.

<l> Most boys live with the 'secret' that they are gay for about three
   years in the middle of their school lives.

<l> 90% of girls and 93.4% boys had not told their parents they were gay
   by the time they were doing their GCSE or Junior Certs (16)

<h> Stage 4 - Commitment<

<p> G28 said  "It made me stronger to face future prejudice.  It made me
   more determined to stand up for myself and not let any mindless,
   ignorant superfluous caveman prevent me from being what and who I was
   destined to be.  For that, I can be a better person, proud of myself
   and my kind."

<p> The next stage in the process of 'coming out' involves becoming being
   lesbian or gay openly and recognising that it is a central aspect of,
   'who I am', and, 'how I want to live my life'. Young people begin to
   feel that homosexuality is a valid way of life and develop a sense of
   contentment with being lesbian or gay. They often have the experience
   of falling in love at this time and, perhaps as a result, feel more
   confident, fulfilled and able to combat the social stigma that they
   may suffer.

<p> At this time some young lesbian and gay people begin to feel proud of
   their sexuality. The expression of this pride in being lesbian or gay
   is a powerful force in challenging the stigma attached to
   homosexuality by people with prejudiced attitudes and provides
   positive role models to others less sure about 'coming out'.

<h> Stage 5 - Synthesis

<p> No respondents wrote anything that would illustrate synthesis,

<p> The person's sexuality becomes a natural part of their life and ceases
   to impinge on their consciousness.  Being gay is no longer an issue.
   They get on with their lives as any other well adjusted member of
   society does.
