<h> Are You A Representative of USC's Athletics Interest?

<p> You are a representative of USC's athletics interests (commonly known
   as a "booster") if you have made a donation to the USC Athletic
   Department, are or have been a member of a booster organization
   associated with USC Athletics, or you have been involved in any way
   with promoting USC's athletic programs.

<p> Once an individual is identified as an Athletics Representative, the
   person retains that identity forever!

<h> Who Is A Prospect?

<p> A prospect is a student in the ninth grade and above, including
   students in prep schools, junior colleges, and individuals who have
   officially withdrawn from four-year schools. In addition, a student
   who has not yet started ninth grade may become a prospect if USC or a
   booster provides the student, or the student's relatives or friends,
   with financial assistance or benefits not generally provided to other
   students.

<h> What Is Recruiting?

<p> Recruiting is any solicitation of a prospect or the prospect's
   parent/legal guardian by a University staff member for the purpose of
   securing the prospect's enrollment at USC and/or participation in
   USC's intercollegiate athletics program.

<p> Recruiting activities include correspondence, e-mail, faxes, telephone
   conversations and in-person contacts (both on and off campus).

<h> Who May Recruit?

<p> Only coaches and Athletic Department staff may be involved in the
   recruiting process. The NCAA rules specifically prohibit boosters from
   engaging in recruiting activities.

<p> You may not have any contact (i.e., in-person encounter, telephone
   call, correspondence) with a prospect or the prospect's family, on or
   off campus. If a prospect approaches you regarding USC, explain that
   NCAA rules prevent you from discussing USC with prospects. This
   prohibition also applies to prospects making official visits to USC.

<p> You may not contact a prospect's coach, principal or counselor for the
   purpose of evaluating a prospect's athletic ability or academic
   record.

<p> You may not talk to a student-athlete at another institution for the
   purpose of encouraging him or her to transfer to USC.

<h> What May Boosters Do?

<p> You may continue to have contact with an established family friend or
   neighbor who is a prospect. However, such contact may not be for
   recruiting purposes and may not be initiated by a USC coaching staff
   member.

<p> You may bring outstanding prospects to the attention of the USC
   coaching staff by sending them newspaper clippings or other
   information about prospects. However, you may not be involved in the
   actual evaluation of talent. All evaluations and contacts are the sole
   responsibility of the USC coaching staff.

<p> You may offer assistance to members of USC's coaching staff who are
   recruiting in your community.

<h> Common Questions

<h> Q: The son or daughter of an old friend is being actively recruited by
   a USC coach. Do I have to stop having any contact with the prospect
   and his or her parents?

<p> A: No, you may continue to enjoy the same relationship with the family
   that you had before. You may not, however, use your relationship to
   urge that the son or daughter chooses USC, and you may not allow a
   coach to enlist you in the recruitment process.

<h> Q: What should I do if I encounter a prospect while watching my son or
   daughter's high school athletic contest?

<p> A: The NCAA rules prohibit boosters from having in-person contacts
   with prospects. However, the rules recognize that a booster may
   inadvertently (without prearrangement) come into contact with a
   prospect. In this situation, the booster may exchange polite greetings
   with the prospect, but must then terminate the encounter. The
   exception does NOT apply if the contact occurs at the prospect's
   school, or at a site where the prospect is competing. In these
   circumstances, NO contact of any kind is permitted.

<h> Q: May I attend a public event - for example; a community picnic or a
   high school banquet or awards dinner - if prospects are also in
   attendance?

<p> A: Yes, you may. Be sure, though, that you do not have any contact
   with the prospects.What Is An Extra Benefit?

<p> An extra benefit is any special arrangement to provide a
   student-athlete or the student-athlete's relatives or friends with a
   benefit not authorized by the NCAA rules. The NCAA allows USC to
   provide student-athletes with scholarships to cover tuition, fees,
   room, board and books. We can also provide complimentary admissions to
   USC athletic events, practice or competition-related apparel,
   equipment and medical treatment. It is a violation of NCAA rules for a
   student-athlete to receive any other benefit UNLESS the same benefit
   is normally available to all USC students or their
   parents/guardians.Examples of Extra Benefits a Booster Cannot Provide:
<l> * Cash
<l> * Arranging, providing or co-signing a loan
<l> * Providing any kind of transportation or the use of a car
<l> * Tickets to collegiate, professional or any sporting event.
<l> * Gifts of food, clothing or equipment
<l> * Arranging or providing free or reduced cost telephone services,
       housing or professional services
<l> * Arranging or providing employment for a student-athlete's parents,
       guardians or friends

<h> What May A Booster Provide?

<p> You may provide an "occasional" meal at your home for a
   student-athlete or an entire team if you live within a 30-mile radius
   of USC's main campus. You may also provide transportation to your home
   for the meal. The term "occasional" has been interpreted to be no more
   than once per year.

<p> You may provide a job to prospects that have signed a letter of intent
   to attend USC. For addition you may employ an enrolled student-athlete
   under certain circumstances with prior approval from the USC Athletic
   Department. Student-athletes who are not freshmen may receive
   employment income in certain situations. Both the student-athlete and
   the employer must sign a written statement PRIOR to beginning any
   employment during the academic year. Student-athletes may be
   compensated only for work actually performed and at a rate
   commensurate with the going rate in the area for similar services. The
   general limit on employment earnings that do not count towards NCAA
   limits is $2,000 annually, not including official vacation periods.

<h> Common Questions

<h> Q: May I give a discount on clothing, food or car rentals to
   student-athletes as part of my business?

<p> A: No. A discount that is specifically designed for student-athletes
   is considered an extra benefit and against NCAA rules. However, if you
   provide a discount to all USC students or the general public, then
   student-athletes can also receive the discount.

<h> Q: May I loan my car to the parents of a student-athlete who are in
   town visiting their son or daughter?

<p> A: No. The NCAA's prohibition on extra benefits for student-athletes
   also applies to their relatives and friends.

<h> What Can You Do?

<p> If you know of a high school student-athlete who might want to attend
   the University of Southern California, the only permissible activity
   for a representative is to call the appropriate coach.
