<h> Biotech Products Rigorously Regulated, U.S. Official Says

<h> Stresses importance of public confidence in government regulation

<p> The three U.S. agencies responsible for regulating agricultural
   biotechnology are working to assure industry, consumers and other
   groups both in the United States and abroad that genetically
   engineered crops, animal vaccines and other products are "rigorously
   regulated for safety," says Chuck Lambert, deputy under secretary of
   agriculture for regulatory programs.

<p> The more the public understands the U.S. regulatory process regarding
   agricultural biotechnology, the more confidence people will have in
   the government's ability to protect the food supply and the
   environment, Lambert told the Senate Agriculture Committee June 14.

<p> U.S. biotechnology regulation is coordinated among the Animal Plant
   Health and Inspections Service (APHIS) of the U.S. Department of
   Agriculture (USDA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the
   Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

<p> Agricultural biotechnology "is a science that is rapidly evolving,"
   and it is "critical" that U.S. regulators keep pace with the new
   technology, Lambert said.

<p> In response to the rapid growth of biotechnology, APHIS has taken
   steps to strengthen its regulations further for field tests of
   genetically engineered crops to ensure the safety of agriculture and
   the environment and to improve compliance with and enforcement of
   those regulations, he said.

<p> USDA first began regulating biotechnology in 1986, he said.

<p> Biotechnology is "the single largest influence changing agriculture
   since the introduction of the cultivator," said Senator Saxby
   Chambliss, Georgia Republican and chairman of the committee. A
   cultivator is a tool used for loosening soil and destroying weeds
   around growing plants.

<p> Researchers are developing genetically engineered pharmaceutical and
   industrial compounds using rice, maize, barley, tobacco and safflower,
   Lambert said. The products being developed include chemicals,
   vaccines, antibodies for humans, and blood proteins, he said.

<p> APHIS regulates the interstate movement, importation and release of
   genetically engineered plants, insects and microorganisms.

<p> EPA regulates biotechnology-derived products used as pesticides. FDA's
   Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition oversees bioengineered
   plant-derived food and ingredients intended for human consumption. Its
   Center for Veterinary Medicine oversees genetically engineered
   plant-derived products used as animal feed or as ingredients in animal
   feed, and bioengineered products used to improve the health or
   productivity of animals.

<h> Senate Agriculture Committee

<h> Review Future Agriculture and Food Biotechnology Developments
<h> June 14, 2005

<h> Hon. Chuck Lambert
<h> Deputy Under Secretary
<h> USDA Marketing and Regulatory Programs

<p> Thank you for the opportunity to be here today. I am pleased to
   provide the Committee with an overview of the Department of
   Agriculture's (USDA) role in regulating agricultural biotechnology.

<p> This is a science that is rapidly evolving, and as Federal regulators
   it's critical that we keep pace with this new technology. Here at
   USDA, we're committed to meeting not only the challenges that we can
   see ahead on the horizon but also those that science has yet to
   discover. Since USDA first began regulating biotechnology in 1986, we
   have deregulated more than 60 genetically engineered (GE) agricultural
   products. In that time, we have also overseen more than 10,000 biotech
   field tests. It's the responsibility of USDA to thoroughly evaluate GE
   organisms to verify that they are just as safe for agriculture and the
   environment as traditionally bred crop varieties, which have been the
   cornerstone of American agriculture.

<p> This is a responsibility that we share with the Environmental
   Protection Agency (EPA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA),
   who are also here today. Under what is known as the Coordinated
   Framework, we work in concert to ensure that biotech crops are safe
   not only for agriculture and the environment, but also the food
   supply. This coordinated effort is critical for reassuring industry,
   consumers, and other groups--both here in the United States and,
   increasingly, abroad--that biotechnology-derived crops, animal
   vaccines, and other products are rigorously regulated for safety.

<h> Regulatory Overview

<p> For its part in this coordinated effort, USDA's Animal and Plant
   Health Inspection Service (APHIS), under the Plant Protection Act,
   regulates the interstate movement, importation and field release of GE
   plants, insects and microorganisms through permitting and notification
   procedures. In other areas, APHIS regulates biotechnology-derived
   veterinary biologics under the Virus-Serum toxin Act. The Agency is
   also evaluating its role in the regulation of GE animals, pathogens
   and pests under the authority of the Animal Health Protection Act,
   which was passed as part of the 2002 Farm Bill.

<p> The regulation of GE plants, however, is where APHIS has the most
   regulatory focus. The Agency has long recognized that plant-derived
   biotechnology research was increasing and becoming much more complex.
   In order to ensure that the Agency remained at the forefront in
   developing appropriate regulatory policies to address the latest
   advances in the technology, APHIS created Biotechnology Regulatory
   Services (BRS) in June of 2002. The program, which started with 25
   employees, has grown to a staff of more than 50. In the last 3 years,
   the program has made a number of changes to review and further
   strengthen USDA's existing biotechnology regulations. During this
   time, BRS has also made a concerted effort to reach out to
   stakeholders interested in biotechnology, including industry,
   non-governmental organizations, States and others to make sure that
   they fully understand the important regulatory changes that have taken
   place.

<p> In general, APHIS' field testing requirements for regulated plants are
   designed to prevent the unintentional environmental introduction,
   whether by pollen movement, seed or grain commingling, or other means,
   of a protein or trait produced in these plants that would present a
   risk or potential risk to agricultural crops or the environment.

<p> Companies, universities and other researchers that wish to field test
   such crops must submit permit applications, with information about the
   plant variety being tested, the purpose of the test, how it will be
   conducted, as well as the specific confinement conditions taken to
   prevent the escape of pollen, plants, or plant parts from the field
   test site. Applicants must also detail how the site will be destroyed
   once the field test is complete to prevent persistence in the
   environment. The planting conditions detailed in the application must
   meet or exceed the stringent requirements set forth by APHIS. These
   requirements are specific to each plant variety, and we continually
   evaluate them to ensure that the latest scientific evidence is taken
   into account.

<p> APHIS also has a streamlined permitting process, called notification,
   in place. Most of the field tests carried out in the United States are
   authorized under the notification process. The notification process
   expedites approvals for field testing for certain types of low-risk
   plants that APHIS has considerable experience in regulating. Under the
   notification procedure, the regulated article to be field tested must
   be a plant, and the genetic modifications to that plant must meet
   established criteria. During the permitting and notification process,
   APHIS also takes into account the requirements of NEPA.

<p> I want to emphasize that APHIS is committed to ensuring that State
   interests are fully considered and accommodated in the Agency's
   biotechnology field test permit and notification review processes.
   Before any field test can be undertaken in a given State, APHIS
   officials provide detailed information pertaining to the proposed
   field test to their counterparts in that State for review and
   concurrence. If a particular State has science-based concerns about
   the confinement measures described in the documentation, APHIS works
   with that State to address the outstanding concerns and add any
   additional conditions the State deems necessary to ensure that the
   field test can be conducted safely. The Agency has never approved a
   field test permit over the objections of State counterparts.

<h> Pharmaceuticals and Industrials

<p> Science is moving rapidly for crops producing pharmaceuticals and
   industrial, and APHIS has taken a proactive approach to safely
   regulating these types of field tests. APHIS' recent efforts to
   strengthen regulations have provided additional assurances to States
   that field trials are safe for agriculture and the environment. In
   2003, APHIS imposed new measures for all crops genetically engineered
   to produce pharmaceuticals and industrials.

<p> Developers are producing pharmaceutical and industrial compounds using
   rice, corn, barley, tobacco, and safflower. These crops are grown to
   produce research chemicals, vaccines, human antibodies, and human
   blood proteins. Although there has been much attention on these
   products, relatively few pharmaceutical and industrial field tests
   have actually taken place. About 90 permits to field test
   pharmaceutical and industrial crops have been issued since 1991 in
   about 15 States. In comparison, we've approved thousands of field
   tests for GE crops as a whole. This is an area of research, however,
   where we expect to see more growth and that's why we've made changes
   in our regulatory process to make clear that pharmaceutical and
   industrial crops are evaluated rigorously.

<p> APHIS issues permits for pharmaceuticals and industrials on a
   case-by-case basis. The Agency also conducts environmental
   assessments, which include public comment periods, whenever required
   under the National Environmental Policy Act and based on established
   safety criteria. APHIS further imposes stringent confinement measures
   requiring increased isolation distances and fallow zones, dedicated
   farm equipment, and restrictions on planting food or feed crops on
   land used to produce pharmaceutical and industrial crops. For example,
   the isolation distance for open-pollinated corn is 1 mile. This means
   that such a field test cannot be planted within 1 mile of other corn
   crops.

<p> To ensure that these permit conditions are being met, APHIS inspectors
   conduct at least 5 inspections during the growing season for all
   pharmaceutical and industrial crops. These inspections coincide with
   key times during the growing season: pre-planting, after planting,
   just prior to harvest, at harvest, and post harvest. After the field
   test is complete, Agency inspectors follow up with two additional
   inspections to ensure that the plot was completely destroyed and no
   left over plants remain. These volunteer plants, if detected, must be
   immediately destroyed.

<h> Compliance

<p> Compliance with APHIS' stringent permit conditions is high, and that
   is due in large part to the Agency's efforts to work with researchers
   to ensure that they understand our requirements and can implement them
   in the field. Given the growing scope and complexity of biotechnology,
   now more than ever, APHIS recognizes the need for scientifically
   sound, effective safeguards and greater transparency of the regulatory
   process to ensure that all those involved in the field testing of GE
   crops understand and adhere to the regulations set forth by BRS. This
   need is echoed by the biotech industry, stakeholders, and consumers.
   To that end, in 2003, APHIS' Biotechnology Regulatory Services
   established a new Compliance and Enforcement unit to further ensure
   adherence to permit conditions. In addition to ensuring that permit
   conditions and recordkeeping requirements are met by researchers,
   APHIS has also instituted new training programs for inspectors who
   inspect and audit field trials of GE crops. This ensures inspectors
   know what to look for in the field and that they handle each
   inspection with consistency and uniformity. The unit also encourages
   self-reporting by researchers should they identify a potential
   infraction. Under APHIS regulations, companies, universities and other
   researchers are immediately required to report, verbally and in
   writing, any potential problems, so that the issue can be resolved as
   quickly as possible in order to confine the transgenic organisms.

<h> Deregulation

<p> After successfully completing the field-testing and data collection
   stage of a new plant variety's development, a permit holder can
   petition APHIS to deregulate the biotechnology crop. In support of
   this petition, the permit holder must submit further information on
   the results of the field-testing, in addition to information
   documenting that the plant poses no risk to agricultural crops or the
   environment. In considering the petition, APHIS carefully reviews the
   data submitted by the permit holder, and also weighs other pertinent
   scientific studies and information. When APHIS deregulates a
   biotechnology-derived plant, it does so because the plant poses no
   pest risk to other crops or plants. After submission of a complete
   petition, deregulation process requires that APHIS publish a Federal
   Register notice thereby making the documents available to the public
   and providing the public with an opportunity to comment. Once APHIS
   deregulates a particular biotechnology product, the company must still
   comply with applicable FDA or EPA requirements prior to marketing. In
   addition, APHIS can bring a product back under regulation at any time
   if the Agency becomes aware of evidence indicating that the product
   may pose some sort of plant pest risk.

<h> Environmental Impact Statement

<p> Efforts to further strengthen our regulations and improve compliance
   and enforcement have improved our ability to protect agriculture and
   the environment while allowing for the safe field testing of GE crops.
   However, as I've mentioned throughout my testimony, we recognize that
   the science of biotechnology is going to continue to evolve and we
   must be prepared to keep pace with those changes. That is why in
   January of 2004, APHIS announced plans to review and strengthen APHIS'
   current biotechnology regulations. As a result of that announcement,
   APHIS is currently conducting a programmatic Environmental Impact
   Statement to evaluate our biotechnology regulations. The decision to
   undertake this EIS is the result of inter-agency discussions, which
   included our sister agencies, EPA and FDA.

<p> The EIS, which is currently being drafted, evaluates environmental
   issues associated with potential revisions to existing regulations.
   Under the Plant Protection Act of 2000, APHIS has broad authority to
   safeguard American agriculture and protect the environment. The EIS
   will look at expanding APHIS' regulatory scope beyond GE organisms
   that may pose a plant pest risk to include GE plants that may pose a
   noxious weed risk and GE organisms that could be used as biological
   control agents.

<p> As part of the EIS, APHIS is also evaluating the benefit of developing
   new criteria, based on risk, familiarity, and intended use for
   reviewing applications to conduct GE crop field tests. Under the
   proposed approach, APHIS would move away from our current system of
   permits and notifications in favor a multi-tiered permitting system.
   This new system would utilize the knowledge we've gained about
   biotechnology in the last 19 years to help streamline the permit
   process for familiar field tests, so we can focus our resources and
   attention on new requests with which we have less experience. Over
   time, this science-based approach would reduce the regulatory burden
   and allow APHIS to concentrate oversight on new GE products based on
   science and potential risk.

<p> The EIS will also consider the environmental effects of exempting,
   from regulation, the low-level and intermittent occurrence of certain
   GE organisms that have not completed all applicable review, provided
   they meet safety criteria and there has been adherence to regulatory
   requirements. This issue is known by many as adventitious presence.

<p> While I've briefly highlighted some of the main issues, the EIS is
   much more broad in scope. In fact, the current programmatic review of
   BRS' existing biotechnology regulations is USDA's largest effort of
   its kind since the Coordinated Framework for biotechnology regulations
   was first established in 1986. We've established an ambitious timeline
   for completing the comprehensive draft EIS and hope to publish the
   document in the Federal Register this fall. Throughout this initiative
   we will continue to coordinate with our interagency partners and
   communicate with the public to hear their views and ensure that they
   understand what it is that we're considering. As a result of the
   initial scoping process we've already received more than 2,000 public
   comments. APHIS also held several days of meetings to hear from
   interested stakeholders, including industry, non-governmental
   organizations and others. As a follow up to that process, BRS will
   again be reaching out to the public this summer by holding open forums
   once a month to hear from anyone interested in our regulatory review.
   These comments will all be considered as we continue to move forward
   in this process.

<p> Finally, I'd like to close by saying that our emphasis on
   communications is part of an on-going effort to be more transparent
   regarding the regulatory process. The easier it is for people to
   understand our regulations, the more confidence we believe they will
   have in APHIS' ability to protect agriculture and the environment.
   We're very excited about the regulatory changes that have already
   occurred as well as those that are on the horizon. In partnership with
   our sister Agencies FDA and EPA, we're confident that we're ready for
   the future of agricultural biotechnology.

<p> Thank you again for the opportunity to be here. I'm happy to answer
   any questions that you may have.
