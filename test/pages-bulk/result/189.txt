<h> Why Radical Islam -- And Why Now?
<h> by Victor Davis Hanson
<h> Tribune Media Services

<p> Read any newspaper or turn on any news broadcast and you're bound to
   encounter stories of Islamic radicals fighting, killing and
   threatening each other -- and just about everyone else.
   In Somalia, jihadists, with the support of al Qaeda, have clashed with
   troops loyal to the country's internationally recognized interim
   government and now threaten neighboring Ethiopia with all-out war.

<p> Here is the plot and the theme: God creates the universe, not because
   he needs to, since he is complete in himself, but as an act of
   gratuitous love.

<h> Whose Fiasco?
<h> by Victor Davis Hanson
<h> Policy Review

<h> A review of Fiasco: The American Adventure in Iraq by Thomas E. Ricks
   (Penguin Press, 2006, pp. 496)
   
<p> Thomas Ricks, the distinguished Pulitzer-prize-winning former Wall
   Street Journal and current Washington Post journalist, has published
   widely on defense issues, winning the respect of many, both inside the
   Pentagon and while on deployment abroad, for his disinterested
   narratives.

   ________________________________________________________

<h> Editor's Note: 

<p> Two-and-a-half years ago, in May 2004, VDH warned that all the
   squabbling over Iraq could be put to rest should the United States
   take the initiative and defeat the insurrectionists, the premise being
   that most have no ideology, but most certainly do not want to be
   associated with a losing enterprise. Then he was worried that the
   withdrawal from the first attack of Fallujah and the escape of Sadr
   sent a terrible message that the United States was not winning, and
   that such magnanimity would be unfortunately considered weakness,
   leading only to more violence.

<h> Our Reptilian Brains
<h> When "Just Win, Baby" sadly trumps everything else.
<h> by Victor Davis Hanson
<h> National Review Online

<p> After our victory in Afghanistan, the president's approval ratings
   soared, only to descend during the acrimony leading up to the March
   invasion of Iraq. But after the three-week war, somewhere between 60
   and 70 percent of these same Americans purportedly returned to their
   earlier support of the president's initiatives.

<h> Who Were We?
<h> by Victor Davis Hanson
<h> National Review Magazine

<p> A slightly shorter version of this review of Dangerous Nation by
   Robert Kagan and The American Way of Strategy by Michael Lind appeared
   in the October 22 issue of the National Review Magazine.
   President Bush and his neoconservative advisers, along with his
   compliant top brass, are pilloried as hegemonists and imperialists,
   spending vast amounts of blood and treasure in a vain effort to ram
   our brand of democracy down the collective throat of the Muslim Middle
   East.

<p> The wider English-reading public discovered the genius of Mark Steyn
   after September 11, and for two reasons other than the fact that his
   amazing prolificacy did not come at the expense of quality.

<h> The Autumn of Our Discontent

<h> The War at Home.
<p> The pundits and politicians on the East Coast have really lost it,
   declaring the war in Iraq now over and lost--even as 140,000 American
   soldiers are not only still in the field, but fighting in the belief
   that they can and will win, and that such a victory leading to a
   stable government in Iraq will enrich millions in the region and make
   us safer at home.

<h> Almost Everything Today

<h> Day of Infamy

<p> Sixty-five years ago today we were attacked at Pearl Harbor. I wrote
   today in my weekly Tribune Media Services column, why, unlike our
   forefathers, we haven't been able to finish the war within four years
   following that similar preemptory and surprise attack on American
   soil.

<h> War and More

<h> Too much about Iraq?

<p> Some readers will complain about reading here more on Iraq, and the
   need to defeat the Islamists in the more general war against terror.
   But the serial writing about the topic is like yelling "Fire" as
   flames engulf the house. Do we yell it only once, and then keep mum in
   fears of boring the scorched inhabitants?

<h> Wars, Then and Now...

<h> Selective Morality

<p> When George Bush Sr. addressed an audience in Abu Dhabi, he was jeered
   and blamed for globalization -- this from a country that can only
   exist with foreign expertise in a globalized world that finds,
   extracts, and sells its accidental petroleum fortune. What exactly
   have the subjects of the Gulf monarchies achieved without foreign
   expertise -- or the armed forces of the United States that alone
   guarantee free and safe world commerce in and out of the Persian Gulf?

<h> So Close, So Far

<h> No, no, no....

<p> The problems in Iraq, in the radical Middle East at large -- with
   democratization, with nuclearization, with Islamism -- are not, repeat
   not, a lack of dialogue with Syria and Iran.

<h> Politics and War, Then and Now

<h> Is it a Roar or a Meow?

<p> Governance is not the same as easy criticism. Already the Democrats
   are learning, as is eternally true of our wonderful political system,
   that loud opposition is not the same as being responsible for
   governance.

<h> They're Back?

<h> All too real

<p> I have been going through the recent report, "Iran: Time for a New
   Approach" co-chaired by Zbigniew Brzezinski (in charge at National
   Security during the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979) and Robert Gates
   (involved in Iran-Contra). It makes depressing reading in its call for
   new talks with the dictators in Iran, since we have done that for 20
   years, and should have learned that they lip-synch back only when they
   feel they have more to gain than lose. Churchill understood that when
   he put an end to Tory backchannel efforts to talk with ascendant Nazis
   after the fall of France. And surely we should learn something from
   the recent Hamas step back and apparent willingness to rethink talking
   to Israel -- given its loss of millions in Western handouts and tough
   Israel retaliation against Gaza.

<p> Here is the record of Donald Rumsfeld.

<p> (1) Tried to take a top-heavy Pentagon and prepare it for the wars of
   the postmodern world, in which on a minute's notice thousands of
   American soldiers, with air and sea support, would have to be sent to
   some god-awful place to fight some savagery -- and then be trashed
   live on CNN for doing it;

<h> Our New Pentheus

<p> Long before Sigmund Freud wrote about repression and the subconscious,
   Euripides the fifth-century B.C. Athenian playwright explored the

   Hippolytus' smug self-righteousness, or poor Pentheus of his
   masterpiece Bacchae.

<h> December 8, 2006

<h> Mr. Hanson, have you ever written anything positive about Muslims or
   Islam, or is it always going to be Israel and the U.S. right, Islam
   always wrong?

<p> Hanson: How odd to suggest that when the now demonized policy, which I
   supported, of staying on after the removal of Saddam Hussein to allow
   elections for the Iraqis was most certainly based on the utopian idea
   that Muslims themselves were quite capable of consensual government as
   we see in Turkey or Indonesia.

<p> So it is up to Arab Muslims to prove that ideal was also true of the
   Arab Middle East, and show that Palestine and Iraq can stabilize and
   conduct democracy under the rule of law.

<p> Another piece of advise to you, as a moderate Muslim in the West: the
   present U.S. policy was about as good as the Middle East was going to
   get, this engagement that saw billions spent in Afghanistan and Iraq
   for democracy, and real American pressure exerted on behalf on the
   people of Lebanon, Egypt, and the Gulf States to have a say in their
   governments.

<p> So we are at a great crossroads: when the world's only superpower puts
   its money and lives behind the idea of consensual government for Arab
   Muslims, will they tweak and fidget about the infidel's hubris, or use
   the opening for their own purposes of reform?

<p> And a word of warning as well: if Iraq should fail, and if there
   should be another 9/11 traced to a terrorist-sponsoring Arab nation,
   and celebrated once more by the proverbial Arab Street, then for the
   next half century the United States will write off all notion of
   reform and liberalization and just deal, as we see with the return of
   the realists, with the Middle East as it is. And that means tough,
   obliterating retaliatory strikes to each terrorist provocation,
   without much concern for illiberal conditions on the ground that so
   enhance the opportunistic terrorists. It is the Muslim world's call,
   not ours.
