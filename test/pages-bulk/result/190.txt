<p> This document outlines the basic principles underlying the proper
   useof the optical radiation safety calculator. It is designed for
   assessingsituations in which the eye is illuminated, either to provide
   a stimulusor to illuminate it for photography, videography or direct
   observation.The optical radiation safety calculator performs
   calculations for radiationat visible wavelengths (400-700 nm), and
   near infrared (700-1400 nm).

<h> 1. Radiometry basics

<p> The basic principles of radiometry can be found elsewhere (link to
   W&Sref), but will be presented here in brief. Measurements can be made
   eitherin terms of radiometric units, which correspond to raw energy or
   power,or photometric units, which are corrected for visibility. When
   dealingwith safety issues, we are primarily concerned with radiometric
   measures;the same principles apply to photometric measurements,
   however, so whenwe use a radiometric term, the corresponding
   photometric term will be listedin parentheses.

<p> The basic radiometric (photometric) measurements are irradiance
   (illuminance)and radiance (luminance). Irradiance describes the total
   power fallingon a surface (such as the surface of a detector, or a
   tissue surface inthe eye). The units of irradiance are expressed in
   power per unit area,typically Watts per centimeter squared (W/cmÂ²).

<p> When a surface is irradiated with a certain amount of power, the
   energycomes from a source. Most sources are distributed in space, that
   is, theyhave some finite size. (This size approaches zero for a
   perfectly collimatedbeam, such as might be emitted by a laser.) The
   radiance of a source issimply the irradiance it produces, divided by
   the size of the source, wherethe size is expressed as the solid angle
   (in steradians) subtended by thesource from the point at which the
   measurement is made. A little reflectionshould make it clear that the
   radiance of a source is independent of thedistance at which the
   measurement is made: if we double the distance fromthe source, the
   irradiance will decrease by a factor of 4 (inverse squarelaw); but the
   apparent size of the source will also decrease by a factorof 4, and
   the two factors cancel out.

<h> 2. Types of ocular exposure

<p> For considerations of eye safety, there are two principle areas of
   concern:the first is corneal irradiance. When optical radiation
   (particularly infrared)strikes the cornea, it can heat and dry it,
   causing damage to the tissue.(Infrared radiation can also cause damage
   to soft contact lenses at levelsthat are considered safe for eye
   exposure, but to my knowledge there isno published data on this!)

<p> The second area of concern is retinal irradiation. Damage to the
   retinacan cause areas of local blindness ("scotomas"). The calculation
   of retinalirradiance is fairly straightforward: the total amount of
   power enteringthe eye can be calculated as the product of the corneal
   irradiance timesthe effective pupil area. The illuminated area
   ofretina will be an image of the source, subtending the same angle
   from theposterior nodal point as the source does from the anterior
   nodal point.Therefore, the retinal area is simply the product of the
   solid angle subtendedby the source (in steradians) and the posterior
   nodal distance of the eye.

<p> To convert retinal irradiance to radiance, we need to divide by
   thesource solid angle; but at the retina, the apparent source is the
   exitpupil of the eye, so this is the relevant measure. It can be shown
   by alittle algebra that this is identically equal to the original
   source radiance!

<p> For the calculations we assume that the source is uniform. This
   assumptionmay be violated for real sources; for example, a lamp
   filament will have"hot spots" where the local radiance is higher than
   the average radiance.In these situations, it is best to use a diffuser
   to homogenize the sourceimage. Diffractive optical elements capable of
   diffusing a beam withina narrow angular range (such as those
   manufactured by Physical Optics Corporation)are ideal for this
   application.

<h> 3. Using the program

<h> Detector diameter.
<p> A circular detector area is assumed. For a circular detector,
   simplyenter the diameter in millimeters of the active surface. For a
   non-circulardetector, calculate the area (in mmÂ²), then divide by pi
   (3.14159), takethe square root of the result and multiply by 2 to
   obtain the equivalentdiameter.

<h> Wavelength
<p> A monochromatic or narrow band source is assumed. For a broadband
   infraredsource, the value here is not too critical, because the
   calculations arenot too wavelength dependent. To be conservative, use
   a value of xxx nm.Broadband visible sources are more problematic,
   because the "blue lighthazard" function has a sharp peak at 4xx nm.

<h> Source dimensions at pupil
<p> These parameters are most relevant for setups (such as Maxwellian
   viewoptical systems) where the source is imaged in the pupil by a
   system ofone or more lenses. In the case where the source image is
   smaller thanthe natural pupil (assumed to be 7 mm), the source area is
   used for theeffective pupil area. For cases where the entireeye/face
   is illuminated directly by a source, the values here do not
   reallymatter, as long as they are larger than 7mm.

<h> Apparent size and distance of the source
<p> For free viewing of a source, simply enter the actual size and
   distance(in millimeters). For Maxwellian view, where the final lens
   appears uniformlyfilled with light, use the diameter and distance of
   the lens.

<h> Detector power
<p> Enter the power measurement in microwatts.

<h> 4. Glossary

<p> Effective pupil area: The area of the pupilthrough which light passes.
   Under free viewing conditions, this is usuallyjust the area of the
   natural pupil. It can be smaller than the naturalpupil under special
   conditions, such as viewing through a small artificialpupil, or when
   using an instrument with a small exit pupil such as a Maxwellianview
   optical system.
