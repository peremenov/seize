<h> More on Women and Last Names:

<p> Many thanks to the many readers who responded to my query about why
   women who marry still change their last names. Note also that
   MetaFilter had a thread about this.

<p> Now the obvious follow-up: If you're a woman who married and didn't
   change your last name, why did you do that (not why you got married,
   but why you didn't change), and how well do you think that worked out?
   Please post comments only if you are a woman, and you did not change
   your name when you married.

<h> bengalgirl:
<p> I did not change my name when I married and I can't imagine how anyone
   could. To me, that would be like changing my face; it's such a central
   part of my identity. It was never even a possibility for me.
   
<p> Plus, I can never remember any of the last names of the few friends I
   have who have changed their last names. I've even met a few parents
   who forget what their own daughter's last name is after she changes
   it! It' actually a bit disturbing when someone changes their name, I'm
   very attached to permanence. I was also surprised to find how happy it
   made my father when he found out I was keeping my (and his) last name.
   
<p> Most men I know seem to think that keeping my last name is admirable.
   However, my husband's family does not approve. They are too
   intimidated to say anything to me about it though, and its a good
   thing, because they don't want to get into an argument with me about a
   tradition based on women as property!!
   
<p> Also, when we have a child, it will have my last name. Both parents
   are generally equal, but I'm the one that has to carry the dang kid in
   my body for 9 months, so the balance is shifted in my favor. My
   husband agrees with that logic.

<h> Jana:
<p> I didn't change my last name when I got married, instead my husband
   took my last name. He didn't feel all that attached to his last name
   since his family is scattered, and he knew that I did feel attached to
   my last name, so it just seemed like the natural choice for us. But
   that being said, had he not been receptive to taking my name I would
   have taken his, or we might have came up with a different new last
   name for both of us. We feel stongly that we have the same name that
   our kids do. It just seems easier that way, and I wouldn't want
   anybody to mistakenly think my child was from a broken home.

<h> Kelly:
<p> I view my name as part of my identity, and while I appreciate the
   "family unity" argument, I also wasn't comfortable with changing my
   name just because I got married.
   
<p> My mother (married in 1969 and a feminist) took Dad's name, and she
   said it was easier to change her name and it was a man's name anyways.
   For me, it's not about it being a man's name, it's about the name I
   was born with, got used to, practice under and associate myself with.
   And it also seems a little unfair that the default is that the woman
   changes her name. If both change to a new name, that seems much more
   equitable.
   
<p> Unlike some women who kept their names, I have no qualms about being
   called by my husband's last name, and I occasionally offer that name
   in social settings for convenience purposes. We get mail with all
   sorts of combinations of our last names. I do not care what other
   people call me, I am not bothered in the least to be called by his
   name -- I simply did not want to change my name professionally or with
   my friends and family.
   
<p> Children pose a problem. There is a family unity issue there (of
   course, I am no less my husband's wife if I do not share his name, so
   I am no less my child's mother if I do not share her name), but
   there's also a convenience issue - you'll have to take extra steps to
   prove that you're the spouse or mother if your name isn't the same.
   Therefore, if we have children, we'll review my decision, and perhaps
   even choose a new last name for all of us.
   
<p> FWIW, my name is English and my husband's name is hard to pronounce
   when read, hard to spell when heard, and is ethnic (and I am not that
   ethnicity). He uses my name when we order pizza.

<h> Tracy Wilkinson:
<p> I didn't change my name mostly for practical reasons. Although my
   husband's surname is earlier in the alphabet than my own, and is from
   as good old English stock as my own, no one in New Zealand can spell
   it accurately. They also can't spell my first name accurately. The
   thought of spending the rest of my life going:

<p> "No 'e' in Tracy. Yes, there's an 'e' at the end of [hubby's
     surname]. But not in Tracy. And there's no 'a' in the surname. Yes,
     there is one in Tracy. Yes, an 'a' but no 'e'. In Tracy, not in
     [hubby's surname]. ...'

<p> was just too much for me.

<p> Even my husband makes restaurant reservations in my name. He started
   doing that even before he proposed.
   
<p> There was also the thought of all the hassle of changing my name on
   all my cards, accounts, email addresses, etc. And the feminist part of
   me that said "no one is suggesting that he change his name".
   
<p> Practically it's worked out fine. I've never had any problems
   convincing people that we're married, including when we've travelled
   overseas. His family and a few of my friends write letters to me
   addressed with his last name, and I keep meaning to get around to
   telling them that I haven't changed it. Occasionally people comment,
   but never negatively.
   
<p> We haven't had kids. If we do I think I'll give them both names, with
   my surname as a middle name. I will also make sure their first names
   don't have any alternative spellings. They can use whatever name they
   like to make restaurant bookings.
<p> As to why their surname first - my husband's surname is unusual and I
   quite like maintaining diversity.

<h> anonymouse:
<p> I have been married for just over two years. I had never considered
   changing my name. I like my last name; I identify with my father; I'm
   an only child, and I wanted to keep the name around at least one more
   generation.
   
<p> My husband never asked, and it never really occurred to me to change
   my name. It's also the case that I've published a couple papers, but I
   don't really respect those publications enough to care. Mostly, I
   didn't want to be someone else, I wanted to be myself, and I thought
   that changing my name would make me sad.
   
<p> Sometimes I wonder sometimes if it wasn't silly of me to keep it. I
   feel a bit guilty that people refer to my husband as Mr.
   Mylastname--I'm the one most involved in our community, the one who
   signs the bills, and many times people here just assume we have the
   same name.
   
<p> I haven't thought about the kids' name problem yet.

<p> re: practicality: it's never been an issue for me, but then again, no
   one misnames me; they misname my husband. Never had any issues with
   bills or paperwork.
<h> 5.18.2005 9:33pm

<h> Dawn Park:
<p> I didn't change my last name because I was just too darn lazy to go
   through the hassle of changing all of my documents--driver's license,
   passport, social security card credit cards, etc.. I'm not
   particularly attached to my name considering it's an arbitrary
   transliteration of my Korean name. Actually, my first name isn't the
   one I was born with, but rather one that was randomly selected by my
   sister after we arrived in the states.
   
<p> I've encountered a small amount of confusion by not having changed my
   name, but nothing monumental. Our children have my husband's name
   because that's convention and I really don't care one way or the
   other.
<h> 5.18.2005 10:01pm

<h> Laura:
<p> I did not change my name upon marriage because: (1) I had already
   begun to establish myself as a lawyer with my maiden name; (2) I liked
   the sound of my name as it was; (3) changing my name seemed (and still
   seems) tantamount to changing my identity. So, a professional reason,
   a stylistic one, and a personal one.
   
<p> No children as of yet, but they will have my husband's name, I
   suppose. Socially, I don't think I'll mind being addressed as Mrs.
   Husbandslastname, particularly if it reduces confusion with the
   children.
<h> 5.18.2005 10:49pm

<h> Lynne:
<l> 1. I already had publications under my given name.
<l> 2. I couldn't be bothered to go through all of the bureaucratic hassle
   on SSN, credit cards, 401K, etc.
   
<p> Interestingly, I never thought of it as an identity thing one way or
   the other, nothing philosophical.

<h> David Has to Add Something Because David's Taken:
<p> Well, I'm not the party to the marriage whom you addressed, but I took
   my wife's last name. I'm happy to read Jana's note above, as this is
   the closest I've come to meeting anybody else who's done the same. Why
   did we do it? We were set on having the same name in order to signal
   our attachment and make things less confusing for our children and
   those who encounter them. We seriously considered inventing a new
   name, especially as a combination of our names, but none of the
   possible combinations proved very attractive. In the end, she was more
   attached to her name and family than I was to mine, and her name was
   also more aesthetically interesting.
<h> 5.19.2005 1:02am

<h> dgm:
<p> I kept my family name because I consider it part of "who I am." I got
   married when I was 30, but I would have kept the name even in my 20s,
   before I started on the career path. I like the sound of it, and had I
   taken the mate's name, I would have converted my own into something
   bovine: Donna Bell. Ugh.
   
<p> Our two kids have both our last names, which I think makes it easier
   for future geneologists. (Besides, my husband insisted they have his
   last name, too ;-) )I don't buy the argument that we can't signal
   family unity unless we all share the same name. I think it's pretty
   clear by our names that we are all from the same family unit.
   
<p> I think this has worked out well, and I certainly have no regrets
   about my or my kids' names. Sometimes I have to take a little extra
   time to explain to people that we all have different but related last
   names (like when we make airline reservations), but the only time it
   bothers me is when I have to have the discussion (over and over)with
   my own friends, especially those who've known me long before I got
   married.
   
<p> Incidentally, I'm surprised at how few women have commented on this
   compared to the number of commenters on your previous post for those
   who changed their names. Are we really that much in the minority??
<h> 5.19.2005 8:46am

<h> Mr. & Ms.:
<p> I'm going to chime in, despite being the wrong gender, as my wife and
   I both wrestled with the question of which, if either, of us should
   change names. We ultimately decided to keep ours.
   
<p> Best as I can tell, this has posed a problem once in four years of
   marriage, and then only a minor one: when checking in at an airport in
   a small city in the South (and plausible marriage or honeymoon
   destination), we had this conversation:
   
<l> Me: We're both checking in, please. Two bags.
<l> Agent: Which bag is whose?
<l> Me: Oh, it doesn't matter, we're married.
<l> Agent: Oh...the reservations are in different names. [starts
   consulting policy manual] Do you have your marriage license?
<l> Me: What do we need that for? The tickets match our IDs.
<l> Agent: Aha! How exciting. Congratulations!
<l> Me: [confused]
<l> Agent: How long have you been married?
<l> Me: Uh, a bit over two years.
<l> Agent: [confused]

<p> We got our boarding passes and made a speedy getaway.

<p> I see the appeal in the one-name, one-family thing, but it's just not
   important-seeming enough to be worth the hassle and the inequity. I
   suspect that if we have two kids, one will get each name--fairer that
   way, and I think it can actually be really advantageous for younger
   siblings not to be automatically lumped with their older siblings.
   
<p> But I have no objection to going by Mr. [wife's name], either, and I
   often use her name for reservations (it's easier to spell).
<h> 5.19.2005 9:28am

<h> Christine Hurt:
<p> I married eight years ago and kept my last name. Our kids have Paul's
   last name, and contrary to warnings, this has not proved too
   complicated. We live in a complicated world of blended families where
   not everyone has the same last name, so I think the world is used to
   some texture. I felt strongly about keeping my name at the time, but
   over time I can barely remember why. My daughter (aged 6) wants to
   change her last name to my last name. I guess if she wants to when
   she's older, I don't care, although I think her father might!
<h> 5.19.2005 9:58am

<h> Alice Marie Beard:
<p> My husband and I married in 1974. I was 23. I'd never considered any
   option other than keeping my own name. At the same time, I've always
   understood and felt comfortable with the knowledge that I am "Mrs.
   Husband's Name." Our children, 26 and 21, have hyphenated names, with
   their dad's name first. That way, in case they ever opted to drop my
   part of their last name, they'd already be alphabetized just fine.
   
<p> When I was in high school, we had an exchange student from Chile:
   Adolfo Henriquez y Chacon (a man who has gone on to become a brilliant
   petroleum engineer). He spent much of his year in that little small
   town in Indiana explaining his last name to some rather unworldly
   Hoosier kids. His explanation seemed obvious to me, and it's the
   pattern I chose to adopt for my children.
   
<p> There is an advantage to having kept my own name that I never
   anticipated: It turns out that my Polish DP husband has done quite
   well in his area of the law. With my own name, I can "fly under the
   radar." And, when I opt to let people know the connection, I just add
   "Mrs. Husband's Name" after my name.
   
<p> Having kept my own name was easier (no name-change forms to file) and
   has meant that I did not vanish behind a new name.
   
<p> These links may be of interest:

<l> Dunn v. Palermo, 522 S.W. 2d 679 (Tenn 1975);
<l> a 1925 magazine article titled "Do You Use Your Husband's Name?" ;
<l> a piece by Hofstra law professor Joanna Grossman, "What's in a name?";
<l> a newspaper article by me from 1974, "Legal issues of married woman
   who keep their own names." 
   
<p> Frankly, I never would have considered marrying a man who was not
   bright enough to understand WHY a woman might opt to keep her own
   name.
<h> 5.19.2005 11:23am

<h> Iris Engelson:
<p> I married eight years ago at the age of 36 and never seriously
   considered changing my name. Well, that's not entirely accurate: I'd
   have considered hyphenating if my husband had wanted to do that (and
   I'd only have considered it if we BOTH hyphenated). As it happens,
   though, the combination of our names wasn't terribly euphonious and
   neither of us was too keen on making the change.
   
<p> Different last names are fairly common in our social circle (we live
   on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, in New York City) and the
   convention we used for our son's name (Firstname Middlename Mylastname
   Hislastname, with no hyphen) is also fairly common. Between the
   different last names and the mutually agreed upon hyphenations, I
   think that couples in which she took his name might even be in the
   minority.
   
<p> I am entirely in agreement with Eugene's reaction to the idea of name
   changing: my answer to 'why did you keep your name?' would probably
   have to be 'why on earth would I change it?' The minor inconvenience
   of having to introduce myself these days as "Iris Engelson, xxxx
   yyyy's Mom" when calling schools, pediatricians or parents of my son's
   friends hardly seems a compelling reason to jettison the name I have
   used all my life.
   
<p> On the other hand, I never had a problem with my son's having my
   husband's last name. I did want my last name to be included as a
   middle name, though, and I am careful to include all four names on all
   official documents, lest I ever have any problems when we are
   traveling.
<h> 5.19.2005 11:32am

<h> pwdcrazy:
<p> I didn't change my name because:
<l> 1) I had publications under my maiden name;
<l> 2) The paperwork would be a nightmare (including what was then the
   INS);
<l> 3) I am a very different ethicity from my husband, and calling myself
   by his last name seemed utterly incongrous.
   
<p> Our child has my husband's last name, and I don't care if I'm
   addressed socially as Mrs. (Husband's Last Name), or in reference to
   our child.
<h> 5.19.2005 12:01pm

<h> meep:
<p> I got married in my mid-20s, and I didn't see any reason to legally
   change my name. I own quite a few things in my name, and seeing the
   trouble my mother went through just trying to get my deceased father's
   name off of deeds and titles would indicate it would be a supreme pain
   in the ass. Get my Social Security record changed? Get name on
   diplomas changed? What's the point? That's asking for administrative
   trouble.
   
<p> That said, I don't mind being called Mrs. Husband's Name (and I'm
   super-traditional. I would prefer to be addressed Mrs. [Husband's
   first name] [Husband's last name] to Mrs. [my first name] [Husband's
   last name]... because I like being difficult.) I will introduce myself
   as Mrs. So-and-so to people who have to deal with our kids. Most
   people know my last name, though, and so I'm not called Mrs. So-and-so
   that often. Perhaps when the kids are older.
   
<p> I look at it from a purely practical point of view, and don't see why
   my socially used name(s) must be the same as my legal name.
   
<p> In my family: after my father died, my mother remarried. But she
   didn't change her name upon remarriage. So she's Mrs.
   Dead-husband's-name. Legally and socially. Only a few people have
   remarked on it, but most people just accept it. She was married to my
   Dad before she graduated college, so perhaps she had come to identify
   it as her own. Or perhaps she didn't want to go through the crap of
   changing all the paperwork. Or perhaps she wanted to have the same
   last name as her kids. Or perhaps just pure sentimental reasons. I
   don't know.
   
<p> My middle sister has done as I have -- socially, she goes by husband's
   name, hasn't changed her legal name. My youngest sister does not go by
   her husband's name at all. All of us got married in our 20s, after we
   graduated college (and gotten masters degrees).
   
<p> Oh, and none of us have done the hyphenated-name thing to the kids.
   They have their fathers' last names.
<h> 5.19.2005 1:05pm

<h> Susan West:
<p> I changed my name several years before I met my husband because I
   wanted something easy to spell and pronounce. I wasn't likely to
   change it again (although contrary to what other posters have said, it
   wasn't that much work in the first place -- in fact it was
   surprisingly simple).
   
<p> I also wasn't likely to take his name because I always thought that
   was really silly, particularly in the context of a traditional
   wedding. The bride shows up wearing a hat that makes her look like an
   alien landed on her head with a veil covering her face (and therefore
   masking her identity). Carol Springer marries David Anderson, and at
   the end the officiator introduces "Mr. and Mrs. David Anderson." Where
   did Carol Springer go? The whole ceremony seems designed to strip the
   bride of her entire identity through the costumes and the name change
   -- clearly a reflection of the historical view of women as property.
   Not my style.
   
<p> I do resent when people call my by my husband's name. I find it
   irksome that they are so presumptuous as to assume that I am
   subservient to him, and so 1950s that they still apply this default. I
   recently checked my info on Lexis and found that although the title to
   our home, and the mortgage for it, are both listed in both of our
   names, the Lexis database shows me with his last name. Who on earth
   thought it was their business to give me an entirely new name? Makes
   me crazy.
   
<p> Our daughter has my last name. We never considered any other option.
   It would have been the same if she'd been a son. My husband's parents
   would have been apoplectic over this if they hadn't been so relieved
   to finally have a grandchild. Given how unlikely this was to happen at
   all, they would have been delighted if we'd named her Baby Doe.
   
<p> My husband thought about taking my last name, but ultimately I didn't
   want him to because no one would have believed that he had taken my
   name rather than that I had taken his. I wanted the names to be
   different so that my identity was never subsumed under his.
   
<p> We've never had problems being treated as a family, even though we
   have different last names, and no one has ever assumed (out loud
   anyway) that our daughter is not legitimate. This may come from us
   being older parents (late 30s when she was born) and having been
   married for many years before her arrival. But who knows what people
   are really thinking (and frankly, who cares).
<h> 5.19.2005 3:35pm

<h> Castiron:
<p> I didn't change my name because I couldn't think of any good reason to
   change it that wouldn't equally apply to my husband. (As we ultimately
   divorced, I'm glad I didn't have the hassle of deciding whether to
   keep his name or revert to my old one, but "it's one less hassle if we
   divorce" was not one of my reasons.) We did consider both taking a new
   surname, and even had a name that we agreed on, but he felt it would
   be too expensive to do a name change that his home country would
   accept, so we both kept our names. Our son's name is hyphenated; we
   find that the hypenated last name is no big deal, certainly not nearly
   as much trouble as the boy's having four middle names (traditional in
   father's home country)!
   
<p> If I should marry again, I'm not planning to take my husband's name,
   unless he happens to have my maternal grandmother's rare surname. I'll
   be happy for both of us to hyphenate our names together or to change
   to a different surname; he can even take my surname if he really wants
   to.
<h> 5.19.2005 4:25pm
 
<h> Cal Lanier:
<p> I got married at 24 and never considered changing my name. My son has
   his dad's last name, first because it wasn't that big a deal to me and
   second because my family name is carrying on courtesy of two other
   nephews and a horde of cousins, whereas my son is the only son of an
   only son. (His middle name, which is also the name he goes by, is my
   family name.)
   
<p> Names are fundamental to identity for me. I've used the same online
   name for years and would have a huge problem changing it, never mind
   the one I was born with.
   
<p> For the life of me I can't see what issues are involved with family
   members having different last names. Legal or bureaucratically, I've
   never spent 5 seconds extra because my son has his dad's name and I
   don't.
   
<p> The "family unity" argument has never made any sense to me, either.
   It's supposed to convince outsiders that the spouses really do love
   each other, or what?
   
<p> I don't really care whether women change their name or not, but for
   some reason I go absolutely nuts at women who say "Oh, I couldn't wait
   to change my name! I've always hated it!" Smackdown time.
<h> 5.19.2005 4:34pm

<h> Rebecca:
<p> I am getting married in September and I intend to change my last name
   to my husband's name. I am a practicing attorney and I think the name
   change will initially be impractical for my colleagues, but I suppose
   that's just life. I considered not changing my name, but in the end it
   was important to me to be his wife not just his best friend and
   partner. In my mind, assuming the same last name is a symbol of a
   couple's unity that goes beyond their partnership and commitment. I
   don't feel as though I am becoming a member of his family as much as
   he and I are becoming our own family. Sharing a name is a strong
   symbol of the indisolubility of our marriage. Concededly, the same end
   would have been achieved by him taking my name, but I simply prefer
   his name.
<h> 5.20.2005 10:56am

<h> mikeunique3222:
<p> I'm married to a Japanese woman. My father-in-law changed his name to
   my mother-in-law's name, because she had no brothers, while he had
   brothers. By changing his name, he could continue the family line of
   his wife, my mother-in-law. This is fairly common in Japan, at least
   in rural areas.

<p> My wife changed her name to mine. Having a non-Japanese name presents
   some hassles for her, but having a name different from her husband
   would present another set of hassles. The Japanese wife of a UK friend
   of mine stuck with her maiden name for a few years, but gave in when
   they had children. The Japanese wife of a US friend uses her maiden
   name as a sort of professional name, but her legal name is her
   husband's.

<p> My first mate let me keep my name.

<p> She on the other hand couldn't wait to change hers. Family issues.
<h> 5.20.2005 12:57pm

<h> Karen A. Wyle:
<p> I am about-to-be-50, and got married at age 34. I kept my name for
   several reasons: professional license (law), attachment to my family,
   preservation of my family name, and a husband who couldn't understand
   why I'd consider changing it. In spite of all-but-the-last factor, I
   would have considered having us both change to a new name, but my
   husband had no intention of changing his name.
   
<p> We agreed before we had kids that girls would have my name and boys
   his. (My husband got the idea from reading about a tribe somewhere
   that took this approach.) As it happened, we had two girls. My husband
   doesn't mind -- his family and its name are very widespread, so he
   didn't feel the need to beget more Hagers.
   
<p> When our first daughter was born, the hospital made him sign a form
   saying something to the effect of "I know it'll be a hassle if we
   change our minds later about the baby's last name". He was outraged
   that they would treat the use of the mother's name so differently from
   the more usual use of the father's name.

<h> Elizabeth:
<p> I consider my name part of who I am, and to change it after marriage
   would have been changing who I am. My husband actually seemed pleased
   I was keeping my name, I think for similar reasons. The woman he
   married is the same woman he dated.
   
<p> Any children we have will bear his name. Not so much because he's the
   male, but because he's the only son of an only son, whereas I have a
   brother who's children will likely carry my family name. Besides, his
   name is much rarer than mine to begin with and it'd be a shame for it
   to disappear.

<h> David Has to Add Something Because David's Taken:
<p> I mentioned above that I'd changed my name to my wife's name. One
   additional thought: it has been harder for me to change my name
   legally than it would've been for my wife. I still have one credit
   card with my "maiden" name on it (anybody have a good term for that?)
   because the out-of-state bank (Chase) will not accept a Michigan
   marriage license as proof of a name change even though Michigan
   explicitly permits names to be changed either way (or hyphenation,
   etc.) with no further documentation. Interestingly, Citibank had no
   problem with it. Perhaps I should add that I've been carrying this
   non-id-matching card for almost ten years now, as our tenth
   anniversary is next month. Every once in a while I try to change it.
