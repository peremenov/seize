<h> THE RHODES ~MILNER

<h> ROUND TABLE

<p> While researching the origins of the ReligiousRight for this series,
   we came across an obscure but significant passagein an obscure but
   highly significant document titled "The Belmont Brotherhood".This
   report is an expose of the John Birch Society, whose founding
   memberswere discovered to be, in the main, high-ranking Freemasons and
   membersof other subversive organizations. The authors intended to
   develop theBelmont report into a book, but did not do so for reasons
   that remain unknownbut should become apparent to the reader upon
   discovery of the variousconnections of the JBS founders. Since the
   John Birch Society successfullylaid the foundation for the
   exploitation of Christians through the ultra-conservativemovement, the
   Belmont Brotherhood is must reading for every
   Christian:http://watch-unto-prayer.org/belmont.html

<p> The passage which intrigued us is found undersection #5 -- a profile
   of former JBS National Councilman, J. Nelson Shepherd,who belonged to
   the very elite Newcomen Society. This mysterious societywas to be
   exposed by authors of The Belmont Brotherhood in their book whichnever
   materialized, and there is scant information available elsewhere.The
   president of the Newcomen Society for some length of time was
   CharlesPenrose, Jr. who was also a member of two high-level,
   subversive and one-worldsocieties in the U.S. known as the
   PilgrimSociety and the English-Speaking Union.  We have already
   postedtwo reports by Eric Samuelson about these societies, which have
   their originsin the Cecil Rhodes-Milner Round Table Group of Great
   Britain, which purposewas to reestablish the British Commonwealth of
   Nations and, ultimately,to bring the world under the domination of a
   restored British Empire.

<p> What Cecil Rhodes and Alfred Milner had inmind was the formation of a
   master/slave society based upon the principlesof eugenics as derived
   from Plato's Republic.MalthusianEugenics is the philosophy of
   depopulation through the reduction ofinferior races --"human weeds"--
   and the selective breeding of "a raceof thoroughbreds" as described
   early in this century by Rockefeller-funded,Planned Parenthood
   founder, Margaret Sanger. When Thomas Malthus' theoryof population was
   later coupled with Charles Darwin's evolutionary model,the result was
   known as Social Darwinism.

<p> The combination of Malthusian populationcontrol, which included the
     deliberateneglect of populations and indirect methods of killing
     off population,with Darwinism, produced National Socialism
     (Germany), International Socialism(Marxist Russia) and
     International Corporate Capitalism (Global Socialism,headquartered
     in the United States), and these forms of social conducthave
     constituted the main reason for the unequal distribution of
     planetaryresources, famines, planned biological warefare,
     environmental poisoning,suppression of knowledge, suppression of
     inventions, dependence on backwardtechnology for the population,
     planned wars to kill off populations andgeneral planetary disorder.
     The problem is in the Social Darwin-Malthusparadigm, which has now
     been combined with the pseudo-sciences of behaviorismand genetics
     in the attempt to assert even tighter control over the
     planetarypopulation, yielding forms of Neo-Darwinism being
     perpetrated by a hostof post-Atlantean re-treads, per a 1947
     Princeton consensus.

<p> Malthusian eugenics has long captivated the imaginationsof the very
   elite who control the world's wealth and power structures.Nearly two
   centuries of applied principles of Social Darwinism have positionedthe
   world whereby the empowered elite classes may govern the slave
   racethey create to labor under their monopolist capitalist rule. Since
   theOrders of Freemasonry largely comprise the ruling elite which owns
   thetransnational corporations, a Masonic history of TheRound Table is
   instructive:

<p> Throughout most the ninetieth century,French Freemasonry, and not
     English Freemasonry, was the dominant revolutionaryforce in the Old
     World - offering the lower and middle classes a voicein government.
     Since its beginning in 1717, the British Brotherhood
     wasaristocratic, capitalist, and monopolistic.

<p> When French Grand Orient Freemasonrysent a German-born Mason, Karl
     Marx (1818 - 1883) to England to agitatethe lower classes to rebel
     against the British aristocracy, the Britisharistocracy became
     concerned. To counter the increasingly influential ideologyof
     French Freemasonry, in 1870 a select group of English Masonry
     deviseda plan which would both satisfy the proletariat and keep the
     Masonic oligarchyin power. The scheme was introduced at Oxford, by
     Freemason John Ruskin.

<p> Ruskin's inspiration and devotionto the creation of an elite of
     race patriots derived directly from Plato'sRepublic. In the
     Republic, Plato called for "a ruling class with a powerfularmy to
     keep it in power and a society completely subordinate to the
     monolithicauthority of the rulers." Ruskin sent out to recoup and
     extend the influenceof British Masonry. He wanted to do this by
     education of the working man.His views on the ruling class as
     developed from Plato's Republic, sentshock waves through Oxford.

<p> "[You, the undergraduates are] thepossessors of a magnificent
     tradition of education, beauty, rule of law,freedom, decency and
     self-discipline but... this tradition [can] not besaved, and does
     not deserve to be saved, unless it can be extended to thelower
     classes in England itself and to the non-English masses
     throughoutthe world. If this precious tradition is not extended to
     these two greatmajorities, the minority of upper-class Englishmen
     will ultimately be submergedby these majorities and the tradition
     lost. To prevent this, the traditionmust be extended to the masses
     and to the empire."

<p> Ruskin's rationale for proclaimingsuch ideas was to plant in the
     fertile minds of his Oxford students thetheory that if they
     educated the working man and elevated him to the middleclass, he
     would labor in behalf of the aristocracy to perpetuate the
     traditionof the upper-class Englishmen - which tradition was to
     control the financesof nations through ground rent, banking and
     trade. Ruskin taught that itwas the essential duty of the
     aristocracy to guarantee an education forthe so that an expanded
     middle class would rule the country. This arrangementwould be a
     type of legal slavery whereby both classes would benefit.
     Throughthe power of finance, the ruling class would maintain
     control from behindthe scenes, while the working class would have
     opportunity to share inthe common wealth made available through
     loans.

<p> Ruskin successfully transmitted hisvisionto his students at Oxford.
     They in turn became the Masonic movers and shakersin the new
     politics and economics that today govern the seven
     industrialnations of the world - the United States, Canada,
     England, Germany, France,Italy, and Japan.

<p> A wealthy young man, Cecil Rhodes,like John Ruskin believed that
     only the British elite could and shouldrule the world to the
     benefit and happiness of mankind. Shortly after arrivingat Oxford,
     Rhodes was initiated into Freemasonry at the Apollo Universitylodge
     No. 357. On April 17, 1877, he was raised a Master Mason in the
     samelodge. Rhodes also joined a Scottish Rite Lodge at Oxford
     called PrinceRose Croix Lodge No. 30.

<p> What sort of character was CecilRhodes? Rhodes was a critic of
     English Freemasonry - of its impotence andincompetence in advancing
     British race interest. After being raised toMaster Mason on April
     17, 1877, Rhodes drafted a program for world dominionby the British
     race patriots. To guarantee the funding from his vast wealthof his
     world vision for the British empire, Rhodes wrote in 1877 the
     firstof seven wills that he composed over his lifetime. The first
     will calledfor the formation of a "secret society" whose primary
     function would befocused on returning England to her former glory.
     He viewed English Freemasonryand its conspiracy as impotent and in
     effect defunct in this regard. Ironically,when the society Rhodes
     had envisioned was finally organized after hisdeath, its membership
     consisted only of English Freemasons. "The RoundTable," as it was
     known, soon became the most powerful appendage of theBritish
     Brotherhood.

<p> In his third will Rhodes left hisentire estate to Freemason Lord
     Nathan Rothschild as trustee. Rhodes stipulatedthat his gigantic
     fortune be used by his disciples to carry out the programhe
     envisioned. Rothschild appointed Freemason Alfred Milner to head
     upthe Secret society for which Rhodes's first will made provision.
     Lord Milneronce remarked of himself, "My patriotism knows no
     geographical but onlyracial limits. I am a British Race patriot."

<p> Upon his appointment by Rothschildto chair Rhodes's secret society,
     Milner recruited a group of young menfrom Oxford and Tonybee Hall
     to assist him in organizing his administrationof the new society.
     All were respected English Freemasons. Among them wereRudyard
     Kipling, Arthur Balfour, Lord Rothschild, and some Oxford
     Collegegraduates known as "Milner's Kindergarten." In 1909,
     Milner's Kindergarten,with some other English Masons, founded the
     Round Table. The grandfatherof all modern British Masonic "think
     tanks" was born.

<p> Three powerful think tank offshootsof the Round Table are (1) the
     Royal Institute of International Affairs(RIIA), organized in 1919
     in London; (2) the Council on Foreign Relations(CFR), organized in
     1921 in New York City; and (3) the Institute of PacificRelations
     (IPR), organized in 1925 or the twelve countries holding
     territoryin what today we call the Pacific Rim.

<p> The initial assignment of the RoundTable was not necessarily to
     destroy the political experiments of FrenchFreemasonry, such as
     socialism and communism, but to cooperate with themfor the
     advancement of the English Masonic conspiracy.

<p> Some seven years before the organizationof the Round Table, of
     which H.G. Wells would be a founding member, Wellsexplained the
     strategy by which aristocratic English Freemasonry wouldreach its
     goal of world dominion. He called it an "Open Conspiracy" asopposed
     to French Freemasonry's closed or secret conspiracy.

<p> "The Open Conspiracy will appearfirst, I believe, as a conscious
     organization of intelligent and quitepossibly in some cases wealthy
     men, as a movement having distinct socialand political aims . . ."

<p> H.G. Wells, previously a member of the socialistFabian Society of
   England, was, according to the MacKenzies' history ofTheFabians,
   "branching out into speculationsabout a new social order..." An
   elitegroup of Twelve Wise Men, which included [Bertrand] Russell and
   Wells,were selected as the "Co-Efficients" who met to discuss and
   formulate,"Ideas about racial improvement by selecting out the
   efficient...and [GeorgeBernard] Shaw was working on these 'eugenic'
   notions in his new play Manand Superman. [Fabian and Co-Efficients
   co-founder] Beatrice Webb calledit 'the most important of all
   questions, the breeding of the right sortof man...'

<p> "Aboveall they were avowed elitists, intolerant of the cumbersome
     and apparentlywasteful processes of democracy, who wanted to see
     England ruled by a superiorcaste which matched an enlightened sense
     of duty with a competence to governeffectively. All of them,
     moreover, shared Sidney [Webb]'s belief -- whichhad led him to
     spend so much effort on London education and on the Schoolof
     Economics -- that social improvement depended upon the training of
     thesuperior manpower needed to carry out schemes of reform. Shaw
     was suggestingin his latest play that universal suffrage was a
     disaster, putting powerin the hands of the 'riff-raff' and... Webb
     who could not wait until anew race of supermen had been bred up to
     establish the millennium, feltthat improved education and
     intelligent politics would at least start thenecessary process of
     regeneration." (Mackenzie, TheFabians, pp. 283, 290-1)

<h> TheAmerican Round Table


<p> The existence of an American Round Table wasdisclosed in The
   Anglo-AmericanEstablishment by Carroll Quigley, aprofessor (now
   deceased) in the School of Foreign Service at GeorgetownUniversity and
   the mentor of President Bill Clinton:

<p> In the middle of 1890s Rhodes hada personal income of at least a
     million pounds sterling a year (then about$5,000,000) which was
     spent so freely for his mysterious purposes thathe was usually
     overdrawn on his account. ...These purposes centered onhis desire
     to federate the English-speaking peoples and to bring all
     thehabitable portions of the world under their control. For this
     purpose Rhodesleft part of his great fortune to found the Rhodes
     Scholarships at Oxford...Thepower and influence of the
     Rhodes-Milner group in British imperial affairsand in foreign
     policy since 1889, although not widely recognized, can hardlybe
     exaggerated...The American branch of this English Establishment
     extendedmuch of its influence through five American newspapers
     (TheNew York Times, New York Herald Tribune, Christian
     ScienceMonitor, The Washington Post,and the lamented Boston
     EveningTranscript).

<p> Early members of the American Round Table resemblea partial listing of
   Who'sWho in the Elite. Thefollowing names were supplied by Eric
   Samuelson: "Those identifiedas American Round Table members by Quigley
   are just a handful. Road Show1 lists Morgan, Rockefeller and Carnegie.
   Also Col. House, Paul Warburgand Benjamin Strong. Princeton's
   Institute for Advanced Study was researchand development project
   center in U.S. Other American Round Table members:Thomas W. Lamont
   (J.P. Morgan), George Louis Beer, Walter Lippmann, FrankAydelotte,
   Whitney Shepardson and Jerome D. Greene."

<p> Ron Chernow describes the Anglophile natureof the House of Morgan and
   the Wall Street establishment: "From its inception,the House of Morgan
   had been Anglo-American in spirit and character. TheGreat War, in
   particular, fused the London and New York banks in a beliefin
   Anglo-American responsibility for peace and prosperity. Morgan
   partnerssubscribed to an idea expressed by Walter Lippman in 1915 that
   U.S. foreignpolicy would experience a 'crowning disaster' if
   uninformed by a 'visionof the Anglo-American future.' (TheHouse of
   Morgan, p. 430)

<p> Putting into practice the principles of SocialDarwinism, "for peace
   and prosperity,"   the chairman of J.P.Morgan and Company, Thomas
   Lamont, secured a $100 million loan in 1926for Mussolini, whose
   success as fascist dictator of Italy and aggressionagainst Ethiopia
   would inspire Adolf Hitler.  Although American statesmendeplore the
   genocide of the past, Secetary of Defense, William Cohen, whoconducts
   the current war against Yugoslavia with Great Britain, is alsochair of
   the George Louis BeerPrize, named for the U.S. point man for the Cecil
   Rhodes Round Table from1915-18.

<p> The Beer profile identifies yet another memberof the American Round
   Table, who in 1953 subverted a Special Committeeto Investigate
   Tax-Exempt Foundations chaired by Congressman Carroll Reeceof
   Tennessee. According to a series of articles in the Chicago Tribunein
   1951, there was a time, prior to the Cold War, when a measure of
   concernwas growing over the shadow cast upon the American government
   by the BritishRhodes-Milner Round Table. The following several
   excerpts from the ChicagoTribune were cited in an anonymously authored
   book, TheUnion Jack:

<p> Why is it so easy for Americans tobe confused about the source of
     Communism? And why can Americans not believethat the British Empire
     is more powerful today than ever in history? Dothey think that
     Rhodes Scholar internationalists who have key positionsin United
     States institutions and government are made in Russia?
     Certainlythey come from Oxford, England. In the year 1951 there
     were some interestingarticles printed by the Chicago Tribune on
     Rhodes Scholars. The Tribuneof course would not do so again nor
     would any big newspaper. Instead theyhave all been assigned the job
     of playing down the importance and strengthof the British Empire.

<p> In the July 15, 1951 article in theTribune entitled "Rhodes Ideals
     Slant State Dept. Policies," subtitled"Key Posts Held by Oxford
     Scholars," by William Fulton, we quote:

<p> "New York, July 15 - Key positionsin the United States department
     of state are held by a network of AmericanRhodes scholars. Rhodes
     scholars are men who obtained supplemental educationand
     indoctrination at Oxford University in England with the bills
     paidby the estate of Cecil John Rhodes, British empire builder.
     Rhodes wroteabout his ambition to cause 'the ultimate recovery of
     the United Statesof America as an integral part of the British
     empire.' The late diamondand gold mining tycoon aimed at a world
     federation dominated by Anglo-Saxons.His intimates have admitted
     the scholarships were established for the primarypurpose of
     instilling 'political Bias' rather than providing education."End
     quote.

<p> Then on July 16, 1951, under thetitle "Rhodes' Ideas Find Fertile
     Ground in U. N." subtitled " 'Scholars'Advance British Schemes," by
     William Fulton, we quote:

<p> "New York, July 16 - American Rhodesscholars, men who have received
     education and indoctrination at OxfordUniversity, England,- are
     prominent in the affairs of the United Nations.The U.N. is an
     outgrowth of schemes developed by the scholars' patron,Cecil
     Rhodes, the British empire builder. Rhodes dreamed of an
     Anglo-Saxonfederation with the British dominating, an organization
     powerful enoughto police the world and preserve the peace. In his
     writings the diamonddespot of South Africa showed he hoped the
     scholarships would promote hisgrandiose idea. Thirty-two American
     collegians go to Oxford each year underterms of Rhodes' will." End
     quote.

<p> On July 17, 1951, under the title"Scholars Help British Cash In On
     U.S. Billions," subtitled "Rhodes MenHold Key Dole Jobs," by
     William Fulton, we quote:

<p> "New York, July 17-'Diamonds area girl's best friend,' the popular
     song goes, and diamonds also are a Rhodesscholar's best friend.
     Approximately 1,400 Americans have gone to OxfordUniversity,
     England, since 1904 with the way paid from the estate of
     CecilRhodes, diamond magnate and British empire builder. Today
     numerous Rhodesscholars are in a position to repay their
     educational benefactor in dollarsfor the sparklers dug up in their
     behalf from the diamond lands seizedby the British in South Africa
     during the last century.

<p> "Rhodes scholars dominate the UnitedStates department of state,
     which directs the doling out of billions inforeign aid, with the
     United Kingdom getting the major share. The savantsalso hold down
     important positions in the economic cooperation
     administration,mutual defense assistance program, and other foreign
     handout setups. Thisis all in keeping with Rhodes' overweening
     ambitions for a world federationdominated by Anglo-Saxons for the
     purpose of enforcing peace and the statusquo. He also aimed at 'the
     ultimate recovery of the United States of Americaas an integral
     part of the British Empire.' With the Oxford-indoctrinatedRhodes
     scholars holding key positions in the Washington
     administration,Britain obtained 31 billion dollars from Uncle Sam
     in the form of 'lendlease' outlays during the war. That was
     followed by the 3.75 billion dollar'gift loan' to Britain in 1946.

<p> During the first three years of theMarshall plan ECA largesse, the
     United Kingdom received 2 billion 706 milliondollars, by far the
     largest allotment. A bill providing 8% billion dollarsfor the
     military and economic aid program abroad is pending before
     congress."End quote.

<p> On July 19, 1951, in the Tribuneunder the title "Rhodes' Wards Hawk
     Global Scheme In U.S.," subtitled "PeddlePropaganda for 'One
     World," by William Fulton, we quote:

<p> "New York, July l9 - Rhodes scholars,returning from schooling and
     indoctrination at Oxford university, England,are the principal
     hawkers of globalist propaganda in the United States.The American
     scholars obtain their education abroad through terms of thewill
     left by the late Cecil Rhodes, British empire builder and South
     Africandespot. Rhodes aimed at the return of the United States to
     the Britishempire and a world federation dominated by Anglo-Saxons.
     He hoped his scholarswould be instilled with 'political bias'
     toward these ends, according tohis intimate friends.

<p> "Previous articles in this serieshave disclosed that many of the
     1,185 living American Rhodes scholars haveobtained key positions in
     the state department, the United Nations, theeconomic cooperation
     administration, the mutual defense assistance program,and other
     government agencies where they have worked toward fulfillmentof the
     schemes of their imperial patron." End quote.

<p> On July 20, 1951, under the title"Rhodes' Wards Head Global
     Foundations," subtitled "Dole Out Cash for OneWorlders," by William
     Fulton, we quote:

<p> "New York, July 20 - American Rhodesscholars, who are spoon-fed
     doses of internationalism a la mode Britishimperialism at Oxford
     University, England, are prominent back home in theaffairs of the
     big foundations doling out funds toward globalist schemesand one
     world propaganda. Higher echelon offices in Carnegie,
     Rockefellerand other privately-endowed foundations are held by
     Rhodes scholars. Thisis in keeping with the aims of the late Cecil
     Rhodes, British empire builder.He left his fortune for the
     conversion of scholars who would promote hisdream of an Anglo-Saxon
     federation to dominate the world. In this way Rhodeshoped to return
     the United States to the empire.

<p> "So far the Rhodes will has underwrittenthe education and
     indoctrination of 1,400 Americans at the English universitysince
     1904. The annual output is 32. They have fastened onto key
     positionsin the state department and other governmental agencies,
     just as Rhodeshoped it would happen.

<h> Funds Further U.N.

<p> "Both-the Carnegie and Rockefellerinstitutions have contributed
     heavily toward 'international' studies tofurther the United Nations
     and other supra-governmental plans designedat chipping away
     American sovereignty. They have also financed organizationsand
     students which according to congressional sources, smack of
     communism,in itself a form of internationalism.

<p> "The foundations have been the bigmoneybags for globalist
     propaganda through the Woodrow Wilson Foundation,World Peace
     Foundation, Foreign Policy Association, Council on
     ForeignRelations, and Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
     Former presidentfor the last-named, it will be recalled, was Alger
     Hiss, the state departmentadviser for Roosevelt at the Yalta
     conference. Hiss is now serving sentencein a federal prison for
     perjury involving war time espionage for the Russians.

<p> "Two Carnegie top executives areRhodes scholars. They are Whitney
     H. Shepardson, director of the CarnegieCorporation British and
     Colonies fund, and O. C. Carmichael, presidentof the Carnegie
     Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching." End quote.

<p> On July 21, 1951, under the title"Rhodes Grads Influential In
     Eastern Press," subtitled "Aid British, GlobalPropaganda," by
     William Fulton, we quote:

<p> "New York, July 21 The picture ofthe American Rhodes scholars
     network in the United States - a rabid movementtoward
     internationalism - is completed and glued together by their
     numbersin the field of molding public opinion. They are highly
     influential inthe eastern press, magazines and radio chains.

<p> "Rhodes scholars in this countryrepresent 32 campus leaders
     carefully selected each year to go to OxfordUniversity, England,
     for supplemental schooling. Their patron, the lateCecil Rhodes,
     British empire builder and diamond tycoon, aimed at instillingin
     his protÃ©gÃ©s 'political bias' rather than education, accordingto
     his intimates.

<p> "This bias, as revealed by the Rhodesseven wills and writings, was
     to recover the United States for the Britishempire in the form of
     an Anglo-Saxon federation. The federation would bepowerful enough
     to dominate the world and enforce the 'peace.'

<h> "Time Follows Rhodes' Line

<p> "Closely following the Rhodes' lineof propaganda is the Time, Inc.,
     magazine group headed by Henry Luce. Lucewas not a Rhodes scholar
     but he did spend a year at Oxford where he spongedup some of the
     imperialistic doctrines carried later in his magazines.Several of
     his top brass editors have been Rhodes Scholars.

<p> "From the start Luce followed theAnglophile trail, whooping it up
     for American intervention in war whenthe British were in trouble
     and damning pro-Americans as 'isolationists.'He is a charter member
     of the 'Eisenhower-for-President' cult, favors entrapmentof
     Republicans by Truman's so-called bipartisan foreign policy, and
     theMarshall plan, which has paid off his magazines.

<p> "In addition to pushing the Britishconcept of policing the world
     with American soldiers and economic aid,the Luce publications have
     been infiltrated by another form of globalism.Whittaker Chambers,
     devotee of world communism and confessed courier fora soviet spy
     ring, was a senior editor ($30,000 a year) for Time
     magazine.Chambers informed on Alger Hiss, Roosevelt adviser at
     Yalta. Hiss is nowin a federal penitentiary for perjury in a case
     involving soviet espionage.

<h> "Rhodes Men on N. Y. Times

<p> "The New York Times, which has beenpro-British since the first
     World war, also has its share of Rhodes scholarson the staff. An
     interesting footnote in journalistic history is that atthe time
     Rhodes' final will was published in 1902, the New York Times
     condemnedthe idea of American scholarships.

<p> "'Why should an American youth goto Oxford when he can get a better
     education at home in respect of thoseattainments which chiefly make
     for national greatness?' inquired the Timesin 1902." End quote.

<p> It is characteristic of those who take powerby conquest rather than
   honest means, to seek first to contain and controltheir opposition.
   Wordworth called it, "The simple plan, That they shouldtake who have
   the power, And they should keep who can." Lest Americansbegin to
   suspect the infiltration and gradual takeover of their governmentby
   the subculture of international Freemasonry, another enemy was
   created.The Union Jackidentifies their technique of diverting
   suspicion from British Communism,courtesy of the Freemasons, by
   leading a crusade against Soviet Communism-- which, having served its
   purpose, is now defunct:

<p> Can anyone deny the widespread influence,or should we say control,
     by Rhodes scholars over America? This is in truththe "iron curtain
     over America" that is undermining American sovereignty.Do the paid
     patriots inform us about British Communism via Rhodes Scholars?

<p> Do the "patriots" tell Americansabout Masonic Communism? Do they
     think that Masonry was made in Moscow?Certainly not! It was made in
     England and every Masonic politician andfederal judge in America
     has given allegiance to Masonry over the UnitedStates Constitution.
     They cannot be Americans and true to the global schemeof Masonry at
     the same time. Why is this so difficult to understand? Thebig red
     five pointed star that rules over Russia and China was made
     inEngland and still gives allegiance to the same.

<h> Do the "anti-Communists" knowthis, or are they Masons too?

<p> Russia is a menace to be sure, butthe British Empire originated the
     Russian system of Communism to exploitthe world as a front for
     British Imperialism while they use religion fromthe churches to set
     up their scheme as a divine kingdom. Confusion comesfrom everywhere
     but always the "poor" British Empire continues to crumble,so says
     the propaganda...

<p> ...Is it not logical and reasonableto see that anyone promoting
     such a gigantic movement as Communism is presumedto be, would also
     be wicked enough to take precautions for controllingany opposition
     that might arise? They could not hope for success ifthey did not.
     So, as Marx and Engels were commissioned to launch socialand
     political Communism from London, it was London also where
     pretendedanti-communism or Spiritual Communism originated for world
     consumption.[bold added]

<p> Karl Marx, the founder of international Communism,was born in Trier,
   Germany in 1818. At the University of Bonn and Berlin,he studied law,
   history, Hegelian philsophy, and Feuerbach's materialism.There he
   edited a radical newspaper which was suppressed, causing his removalto
   Paris in 1843 and Brussels in 1845. With Frederic Engels as his
   closestcollaborator and disciple, Marx reorganized the Communist
   League, whichmet in London in 1847. In 1848 he finalized the
   CommunistManifesto and was expelled from Brusselssubsequent to the
   failed revolution in Germany which he helped to fomentwith the
   Communist League. In 1849, Marx settled in London, where he
   studiedeconomics and wrote the first volume of his major work,
   DasKapital (1867), with volumes II andIII following in 1884 and 1894.
   He died in 1888 and was buried in HighgateCemetery, London.

<p> Karl Marx was the leading figure in the First(Communist) International
   from 1864 until its demise in 1872. Lady Queenboroughnoted in Occult
   Theocrasy,Chapter LXXXV, that the red flag was that of the First
   International, aMasonic movement:

<p> In 1862, the First Internationalcame into being and the part played
     in it by such Freemasons as Karl Marx,Tolain, Fribourg, Varlin,
     Camelinat, Beslay, Malon and Corbon is well known...Karl Marx,
     [was] later to be the moving spirit of the First
     International...destined ultimately to form the keystone of
     subversion throughout the world.

<p> "...on the 5th August [1862], allthe delegates met at a dinner
     given to them by their English colleaguesat Freemason's Hall, where
     an address was read which formed, as it were,the foundation-stone
     of the International..." Mazzini and Marx were entrustedwith the
     task of preparing the address and the constitution... A
     templeworthy of their cult was sought and found... near Geneva,
     where... a finebuilding, the Masonic Temple -- Temple Unique... was
     procured. ...the schemeof the association having been settled in
     London in 1864...

<p> The International now hid itselfamidst the multitude of working
     men's societies of all descriptions thatwere either authorized or
     at least tolerated, and made enormous progressso that its chiefs at
     last declared themselves able to do without any extraneoussupport.
     'The International', said one of the speakers at the BÃ¢leCongress
     (1869), 'is and must be a state within states; let these go onas
     suits them until our state is the strongest. Then, on the ruins of
     these,we shall erect our own fully prepared, such as it exists in
     every section...TheCommune installed at Lyons began its work by
     raising the red flag -that of the International."

<p> The question was posed in TheUnion Jack: Do "anti-Communists" know-
   that Communism was created in England and not Russia - or are they
   Masonstoo?  The answer is partially found in the scandalous profiles
   ofJohn Birch Society founders, as presented in TheBelmont
   Brotherhood.  The authors of this report also identifyfor the reader
   the very sophisticated dynamic of using the anti-communismcrusade as a
   means of controlling opposition to international communism. And with
   extraordinary insight the author of TheUnion Jack: Political
   Messianism & the Right Wing explains thepsycho-political warfare
   involved in the Religious Right's war againstthe Christian Church and
   the United States Government (if the reader canoverlook the author's
   amillennial eschatology and bias against FundamentalChristianity).

<p> Our focus on the Religious Right continuesin a series of reports on
   the JohnBirch Society, its extension, the Councilfor National Policy
   and the British-IsraelConspiracy.
