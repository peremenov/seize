<h> Statement of Stuart K. Pratt, Consumer Data Industry Association

<p> The Consumer Data Industry Association (CDIA) is pleased to submit
   written testimony in connection with a hearing on the misuse of Social
   Security numbers and we thank Chairman Shaw for holding this hearing.
   CDIA has appeared in person before this subcommittee before and we
   hope our testimony will be helpful to you.[1]

<p> Founded in 1906, the Consumer Data Industry Association (CDIA),
   formerly known as Associated Credit Bureaus, is the international
   trade association that represents more than 500 consumer data
   companies.  CDIA members represent the nations leading institutions in
   credit reporting, mortgage reporting, check verification, fraud
   prevention, risk management, employment reporting, tenant screening
   and collection services.

<p> Consumer reporting agencies are careful stewards of personal
   information and they adhere to strict procedures outlined in federal
   and state laws.[2]  The information infrastructure of the consumer
   reporting system is the backbone of the consumer credit economy.[3]

<p> Our members have a strong interest in the legitimate and lawful use of
   all information, including Social Security numbers.  Used properly,
   SSNs play a substantial role in reducing fraud, enhancing workplace
   security, promoting public safety, supporting homeland defense,
   reducing state and federal entitlement fraud, enhancing child support
   enforcement, and facilitating commerce to a diverse, mobile electronic
   society.

<p> Before I specifically address how the SSN is used by our industry and
   the importance of this number, I have found it helpful to provide a
   short review of what a consumer reporting agency is, what is contained
   in a consumer report, and the law that governs our industry.

<h> CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES AND CONSUMER REPORTS

<p> Consumer reporting agencies maintain information on individual
   consumer payment patterns associated with various types of credit
   obligations on approximately 190 million Americans.  The data compiled
   by these agencies is used by creditors and others permitted under the
   strict prescriptions of the FCRA.

<p> Consumer credit histories are derived from, among other sources, the
   voluntary provision of information about consumer payments on various
   types of credit accounts or other debts from thousands of data
   furnishers such as credit grantors, student loan guarantee and child
   support enforcement agencies. A consumer's file may also include
   public record items such as a bankruptcy filing, judgment or lien.
   Note that these types of data sources often contain SSNs, as well.

<p> For purposes of data accuracy and proper identification, generally our
   members maintain information such as a consumer's full name, current
   and previous addresses, Social Security Number (when voluntarily
   provided by consumers) and places of employment. This data is loaded
   into the system on a regular basis to ensure the completeness and
   accuracy of data.[4]

<p> It is interesting to note that the vast majority of data in our
   members' systems simply confirms what most of you would expect; that
   consumers pay their bills on time and are responsible, good credit
   risks. This contrasts with the majority of systems maintained in other
   countries, such as Japan or Italy, which store only negative data and
   do not give consumers recognition for the responsible management of
   their finances.

<p> As important as knowing what we have in our files is also knowing what
   types of information our members do not maintain in files used to
   produce consumer reports. Our members do not know what consumers have
   purchased using credit (e.g., a refrigerator, clothing, etc.) or where
   they used a particular bank card (e.g., which stores a consumer
   frequents). They also don't have a record of when consumers have been
   declined for credit or another benefit based on the use of a consumer
   report. Medical treatment data isn't a part of the databases and no
   bank account information is available in a consumer report.

<h> THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT (FCRA)

<p> In addition to our general discussion of the industry, we believe it
   is important for your Subcommittee to have a baseline understanding of
   the law which regulates our industry.

<p> Enacted in 1970, the Fair Credit Reporting Act was significantly
   amended in the 104th Congress with the passage of the Credit Reporting
   Reform Act.

<p> Congress, our Association's members, creditors and consumer groups
   spent over six years working through the modernization of what was the
   first privacy law enacted in this country (1970). This amendatory
   process resulted in a complete, current and forwarding-looking
   statute. The FCRA serves as an example of successfully balancing the
   rights of the individual with the economic benefits of maintaining a
   competitive consumer reporting system so necessary to a
   market-oriented economy.

<p> The FCRA is an effective privacy statute, which protects the consumer
   by narrowly limiting the appropriate uses of a consumer report (often
   we call this a credit report) under Section 604 (15 U.S.C. 1681b),
   entitled Permissible Purposes of Reports.

<p> Some of the more common uses of a consumer's file are in the issuance
   of credit, subsequent account review and collection processes. Reports
   are also, for example, permitted to be used by child support
   enforcement agencies when establishing levels of support.

<p> Beyond protecting the privacy of the information contained in consumer
   reports, the FCRA also provides consumers with certain rights such as
   the right of access; the right to dispute any inaccurate information
   and have it corrected or removed; and the right to prosecute any
   person who accesses their information for an impermissible purpose.
   The law also includes a shared liability for data accuracy between
   consumer reporting agencies and furnishers of information to the
   system.

<h> SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER USES

<p> Let me now turn to the question of how our industry uses the SSN.

<p> Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, our industry has a duty to employ
   reasonable procedures to ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the
   consumer report.  Further, we must design systems that accurately
   allow our customers to extract only the data requested on a specific
   individual.

<p> We must accomplish this dual mission of accuracy both in terms of
   building databases, but also properly identifying files in our systems
   in the context of a highly mobile society.  Consider the following:
<l> * Approximately 16% of the nation's population moves each year
       according to the U.S. Census Bureau, which means many addresses
       change each year.  (This equates to approximately 42 million
       Americans)
<l> * Based on National Center for Health Statistics, it is estimated
       that there are 2.4 million marriages and 1.2 million divorces
       annually.  This event frequently triggers changes in addresses as
       well as last names.
<l> * In 1998 there were 6 million homes in the U.S. that are considered
       vacation or second homes.  Consumers often switch billing
       addresses if they stay at such residences for long periods of time
       and in some cases maintain billing addresses for both residences
       with various creditors.  (Source: U.S. Census Bureau House Vacancy
       Survey as extrapolated by the National Association of Realtors)

<p> These data clearly speak to the challenge our members face where
   identifying data often changes.

<p> In light of the mobility of our society, the Social Security Number
   plays a very significant role in ensuring data quality.  Our members
   process 2 billion data elements a month.  These elements are a
   combination of credit history data and identifying information.
   Consider the following very real example.

<p> Where a consumer has changed a last name due to marriage or divorce
   and has moved to a new address, which is common in either case, the
   SSN is the most stable identifying element in the file.  First, it
   helps us to identify the consumer's file with precision during this
   life transition where he or she is likely applying for new credit,
   seeking approval for utilities, and seeking to rent or purchase a new
   residence.   The consumer expects that the consumer report will be
   available for all of these necessary transactions and the SSN helps
   our members to meet this expectation.  Second, the consumer expect his
   or her file to be accurate and the SSN helps us to maintain the file
   accurately even when the consumer is in the midst of updating
   creditors with changes in name and address.

<p> The SSN is also a critical element in producing information products,
   which are commonly called locator services.  These services are made
   available, for example, to child support enforcement agencies for
   purposes of locating non-custodial parents;[5] to pension funds which
   must locate beneficiaries; to law enforcement for locating criminals
   or witnesses;[6] to healthcare providers that must locate individuals
   who have chosen not to pay their bills, to state benefits agencies to
   reduce public assistance fraud,[7] and for other similar uses.

<p> Further, the SSN plays a role in fraud prevention products.  Where a
   consumer makes application for a product or service, information
   products that help the business to ensure that they are doing business
   with the right consumer use information products to authenticate or
   verify the application information.  This is true in both for
   bricks-and-mortar business and in e-Commerce.

<p> If applicant data does not match, then the business can take
   additional steps to verify the consumer's identity and thus prevent
   fraud.

<h> FRAUD PREVENTION AND IDENTITY THEFT

<p> In your press release announcing this hearing, you mention the
   potential for misuse of the SSN.  Our industry has a history of
   bringing forward initiatives to address fraud.  These efforts focus on
   the use of new technologies, and better procedures and education.
   CDIA and its members have a long history of being leading innovators
   of identity fraud solutions.  The attachment provides a short
   thumbnail of our involvement in identity fraud remediation since
   1993.[8]

<h> CONCLUSION

<p> In conclusion, you can see by our actions that in large part our uses
   of the SSN are governed under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, one of
   the most extensive privacy laws in the country.  Beyond law, our
   members have a history of proactively limiting how SSNs are used
   outside of the FCRA.  No one particular element of information is the
   key to identity theft.  The underlying theme in all of this is
   balance.

<p> Laws that overreach in attempting to limit use of the SSN are likely
   to merely take fraud prevention tools out of the hands of legitimate
   businesses at the expense of consumers.  Ironically, to prevent fraud
   you must be able to crosscheck information.  To maintain accurate
   databases, you must be able to maintain a range of identifying
   elements.  Absent the availability of the SSN, we will be less able to
   build accurate data bases, to accurately identify records and to help
   prevent the very crime through the development of fraud prevention and
   authentication tools.

<p> Thank you for this opportunity to offer testimony.  CDIA is available
   to assist your and your committee at any time.

<l> [2] All consumer reporting agencies are bound by the Fair Credit
   Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681 et seq. and numerous state
   credit reporting laws.  Among other things, the FCRA requires consumer
   reporting agencies to maintain reasonable procedures to assure maximum
   possible accuracy, 15 U.S.C. Â§ 1681e(b) and prohibits data furnishers
   from furnishing data to consumer reporting agencies if they know the
   information has an error, Â§ 1681s-2(a).  In addition, a consumer
   reporting agency is prohibited from furnishing a consumer report to
   anyone without a permissible purpose -   a narrow and statutorily
   limited list of permitted uses.  Â§ 1681b.

<l> [3] For example, it was recently noted that

<p> Maintaining a reliable and robust national credit reporting system
     is essential to ensure the continued availability of consumer
     credit at reasonable costs * * * The ready availability of
     accurate, up-to-date credit information from consumer reporting
     agencies benefits both creditors and consumers.  Information from
     consumer reports gives creditors the ability to make credit
     decisions quickly and in a fair, safe and sound, and cost-effective
     manner.  Consumers benefit from access to credit information from
     different sources, vigorous competition among creditors, quick
     decisions on credit applications, and reasonable costs for credit.

   2003) (statement of Dolores S. Smith, Director, Division of Consumer
   and Community Affairs, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
   System).

<l> [4] Note that there are in fact a number of major credit reporting
   systems in this country. Within CDIAs membership the three most often
   recognized systems would be Equifax, Atlanta, Georgia; Experian, Costa
   Mesa, California; and TransUnion, Chicago, Illinois. These systems not
   only manage their own data, but provide data processing services for
   the hundreds of local independently-owned automated credit bureaus in
   the Association's membership.

   bureausis essential because these obligations may constitute a
   superior lean on a creditors income.  A Guide About Child Support

   Financial Services, House of Representatives, 105th Cong., 2d Sess.
   (July 28, 1998) (statement of Robert Glass).

<l> [6] Then-FBI Director Louis Freeh testified before Congress in 1999
   and noted that in 1998, his agency made more than 53,000 inquiries to
   commercial on-line databases to obtain public source information
   regarding individuals, businesses, and organizations that are subjects
   of investigations.  This information, according to Director Freeh,
   assisted in the arrests of 393 fugitives, the identification of more
   than $37 million in seizable assets, the locating of 1,966 individuals
   wanted by law enforcement, and the locating of 3,209 witnesses wanted
   for questioning.   Hearing before the Senate Comm. on Appropriations
   Subcomm. for the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, and the
   Judiciary and Related Agencies, March 24, 1999 (Statement of Louis J.
   Freeh, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation).

<l> [7] Consider the following examples:

<l> * Individuals confined to a correction facility for at least 1 full
       month are ineligible to continue receiving federal Supplemental
       Security Insurance (SSI) program benefits Between January and
       August 1996, the sharing of prisoner data between SSA and state
       and local correction facilities helped SSA identify about $151
       million overpayments already made and prevented about $173 million
       in additional overpayments to ineligible prisoners. General
       Accounting Office, Social Security Numbers: Government Benefits
       from SSN Use but Could Provide Better Safeguards, GAO-02-352 (May
       2002), 15, citing General Accounting Office, Supplemental Security
       Income: Incentive Payments Have Reduced Benefit Overpayments to
       Prisoners, GAO/HEHS-00-02 (Nov. 22, 1999).
<l> * Applicants for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), a
       program designed to help low-income families, are required to
       provide their SSNs.  Some agencies share SSN information to verify
       eligibility and identity.  Between January and September 1999, New
       York State estimated that SSN verification saved about $72
       million.  General Accounting Office, Social Security Numbers,
       Government Benefits from SSN Use but Could Provide Better
       Safeguards, GAO-02-352 (May 2002), 15, citing General Accounting
       Office, Benefit and Loan Programs: Improved Data Sharing Could
       Enhance Program Integrity, GAO-HEHS-00-119 (Sept. 13, 200).
<l> * The Department of Education uses SSNs to match data on defaulted
       education loans with the National Directory of New Hires (NDNH)As
       a result of this matchingthe department reported collecting $130
       million from defaulted student loan borrowers in 2001. General
       Accounting Office, Social Security Numbers, Government Benefits
       from SSN Use but Could Provide Better Safeguards, GAO-02-352 (May
       2002), 16.
<l> * Federal agencies that are owned money share that information with
       the Treasury Department which matches the debtors SSNs with those
       taxpayers that are owed tax refunds and reduces the refund by the
       amount owed.  In 2001, the Treasury Department offset tax refunds
       by $1 billion.  Id.

<l> [8] While we agree that identity fraud is a significant problem, we
   also hope the committee will consider any legislation in the context
   of the most accurate and reliable data on the scope of the problem.
   One witness has suggested that the number of identity fraud victims
   could be between 700,000 1.8 million per year.  Misuse of Social
   Security Numbers: Hearing before the House Comm. on Ways and Means
   Subcomm. on Social Security, 108^th Cong. (July 10, 2003) (statement
   of Steve Edwards, Special Agent in Charge, Financial Investigations
   Unit, Georgia Bureau of Investigations; State Coordinator, U.S.
   Department of the Treasury, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network; and
   Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, National White Collar Crime
   Center).  CDIA feels that the best review of the level of identity
   fraud victimization is closer to 60,000 to 92,000 per year, General
   Accounting Office, Identity Theft: Prevalence and Cost Appear to be
   Growing, GAO-02-363 (March 2002), 4, or 162,000 per year.  FTC
   Reports: Figures and Trends on Identity Theft, January 2002 December
   2002.  The GAO figures were developed based on interviews with three
   national consumer reporting agencies.  Consumer reporting agencies are
   probably the best source understanding the scope of identity fraud
   victimization as victims are mostly likely to contact consumer
   reporting agencies as a first response.
                                 __________

<h> Consumer Reporting Agency Responses to Identity Fraud
		   
<l> * 1993.  Consumer Data Industry Association, then known as
       Associated Credit Bureaus, formed a Fraud and Security Task Force.

<l> * 1998.  Creation of True Name Fraud Task Force led by former
       Vermont Attorney General M. Jerome Diamond.   The work of the task
       force included meetings with law enforcement, consumer
       organizations, privacy advocates, legislators and staff, victims,
       and others.

<l> * The capstone of the True Name Fraud Task Force was a series of
       initiatives announced in March 2000.  These initiatives meant the
       consumer reporting industry was the first industry to step forward
       and not only educate its members about the problems consumers
       experienced, but to seek specific changes in business practices.
       The initiatives are to:
	   
<l> + Advocate the use and improve the effectiveness of security
            alerts through the use of codes transmitted to creditors.
            These alerts and codes can help creditors avoid opening
            additional fraudulent accounts.
<l> + Implement victim-assistance best practices to provide a more
            uniform experience for victims when working with personnel
            from multiple fraud units.
<l> + Assist identity theft victims by sending a notice to
            creditors and other report users when the victim does not
            recognize a recent inquiry on the victim's file.
<l> + Execute a three-step uniform response for victims who call
            automated telephone systems: automatically adding security
            alerts to files, opting the victim out of prescreened credit
            offers, and sending a copy of his or her file within three
            business days.
<l> + Launch new software systems that will monitor the victim's
            corrected file for three months, notify the consumer of any
            activity, and provide fraud unit contact information.
<l> + Fund, through CDIA, the development of a series of consumer
            education initiatives through CDIA to help consumers
            understand how to prevent identity theft and also what steps
            to take if they are victims.
			
<l> * 2001.  CDIA announced a police report initiative so that when a
       police report is provided as part of the process of disputing
       fraudulent data, Equifax, Experian and TransUnion will block these
       disputed items from appearing on subsequent consumer reports
       regarding that individual.

<l> * Another collaborative effort with tremendous promise is your new
       police report initiative...I appreciate that certain
       consumer-based initiatives require you to balance accuracy issues
       - knowing that the consumers report contains all relevant credit
       information, including derogatory reports - against customer
       service.  From my perspective, your police report initiative
       strikes just the right balance.  J. Howard Beales, III, Director
       of the FTCs Bureau of Consumer Protection, before the Consumer
       Data Industry Association.  Jan. 17, 2002.  

<l> * 2002-03. ID Fraud Victim Data Exchange.  CDIA and its members
       committed in 2002 to start a pilot test in early-2003 so that when
       an ID fraud victim calls any one of the participating credit
       reporting agencies, the victim will be notified that his or her
       identifying information will be shared by the receiving credit
       reporting agency with the other two participating credit reporting
       agencies and that the following steps will be taken by each
       recipient of the victims information:

<l> * A temporary security alert will be added to the victims file.
       This security alert will be transmitted to all subsequent users
       (e.g., creditors) which request a copy of the file for a
       permissible purpose under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
<l> * The victim will be opted out of all non-initiated offers of credit
       or insurance.
<l> * The CRA will ensure that a copy of the victims file is in the mail
       within three business days of the victims request.

<l> Our efforts are paying off.

<l> * Most calls are prevention related.  CDIA members report a majority
       of consumers who contact fraud units are taking preventative steps
       and are not reporting a crime.
<l> * Victims are learning of the fraud earlier.  According to an FTC
       report in June 2001, 42% of victims learn about the crime within
       30 days or less, a full 10% less than than in the prior report.
       CDIA estimates another 35% lean of the crime within one to six
       months and 7% learn of the crime in six months to a year.
<l> * Victimization of the elderly is dropping.  In 2001, the FTC
       estimated that 6.3% of identity fraud victims were over 65, a 5%
       decrease from 2000.
