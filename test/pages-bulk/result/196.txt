<p> More than 30 student, faculty and staff volunteers from St. Lawrence
   University spent part of the semester break assisting with recovery
   and cleanup efforts at "Ground Zero," the site of the September 11
   collapse of the World Trade Center's twin towers in New York City.
   From January 6 through 12, members of the group worked at two
   locations near the site:
<p> the coroner's office on 1st Ave., where rescue workers may bring the
   remains of someone who, through DNA tests, has been identified as
   missing; and "Ground Zero" itself, where a tent has been set up for
   volunteers to report for assignments from coordinators working with
   the Salvation Army. Depending upon those assignments, volunteers are
   dispatched to various sites where workers are most needed, during the
   3 to 11 p.m. shift. St. Lawrence volunteers have been provided free
   lodging at a nearby YMCA facility. The project originated at a North
   Country Scholar Day admissions event in November; attendees included
   Disaster Relief Project Director for the Salvation Army Randy Widrick,
   a Colton, New York, resident who has been in New York City since
   September 13. On-campus coordination was done by St. Lawrence
   Leadership Academy Project Director Anne Townsend.

<p> Former St. Lawrence University Nordic skiing and cross country running
   and track star Lawton Redman '98 won his third US National
   Championship in the last nine months and took the top qualifying spot
   for the U.S. Olympic team at the Olympic Biathlon Trials.

<h> Town and Gown
<p> St. Lawrence has formally requested that the Village of Canton annex
   four University-owned properties on the north side of East Main
   Street, making them part of the village. All are now part of the Town
   of Canton. In a letter to Canton Mayor Robert Wells, Vice President
   for Administrative Operations Thomas Coakley stated, "Adding these
   properties would appropriately add to the tax base of the Village and
   that is, in fact, our objective in making this request."
<p> Should the request be granted, the University will also request a
   zoning change for the parcels, from their present Town of Canton
   designation as commercial, to the village's "highest permissible
   residential zoning." Coakley pointed out in the letter that the
   properties in question all have deed restrictions that limit their use
   to residential purposes.
<p> The University has also requested that four additional properties be
   removed from tax rolls, and be designated as tax-exempt properties.
   They are:
<l> 21 Elm Street - Viebranz Scholar residence
<l> 7 Maple Street - Safety and Security Officer
<l> 11 Maple Street - Office for Corporate and Foundation Relations
<l> 127 Miner Street - To be a vacant lot
<p> "These are properties that we utilize more directly in the operation
   of the University," Coakley's letter states.
<p> Town Supervisor David Button has referred the request to Town Attorney
   Charles Nash, who plans to report to the town board in February with a
   recommendation.
