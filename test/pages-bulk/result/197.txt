<h> Complex Numbers - Basic Ideas

<p> Here is a geometric story which describes the complex numbers, or
     what mathematicians since Gauss in the 1840's have regarded as the
     complex numbers. This geometric story provides a confirmation of
     the law of signs for real numbers. This first part of the story
     could be explain to someone familiar with arithmetic and the
     measurement of coordinates, rectangular and polar in the plane. The
     second part of this story is an exercise in trig. The second part
     appears in the next chapter.

<p> This applet (online only) illustrates the ideas in this chapter.

<p> This first half assumes you have some familiarity with the measurement
   ofdistances and angles, with the addition of real numbers and points
   in the plane,and finally with multiplication of nonnegative (that is
   zero and positive) realnumbers.

<p> 1. The immediate motivation for this approach (in this chapter)
     stems from three successive 1976 McGill University public lectures
     of the late Richard Feynman. He simply described physics as the
     addition and multiplication of arrows in the plane. He defined
     their multiplication as follows: add their angles and multiply
     their lengths. In terms of the polar coordinate [r[1],q[1]] and
     [r[2],q[2]] for the factors, the polar coordinates of the product
     is [r,q] = [r[1]r[2],q[1]+q[2]] .)

<p> All this was effectively presented to a general audience with no
     mention of vectors nor the Gauss-Argand representation of complex
     numbers. See the foreword.

<p> 2. In Morris Kline's three-volume work Mathematical Thought from
     Ancient to Modern Times, see in volume 2, Chapter 27, the third
     section called The Geometrical Representation of Complex Numbers.
     This section briefly describes the approach of Caspar Wessel
     (1745-1818). Part of Wessel's work (translated into English) is
     reproduced in David Eugene Smith's 1929 work A Source Book in
     Mathematics, Dover 1959 Reprint.


<h> Points in the Plane

<h> Addition

<p> The sum of two points with the rectangular coordinates (a,b)and (c,d)
   is given by (a+c,b+d). Wetherefore write

<p> (a,b)+(b,d) = (a+c,c+d)

<p> For example (2,5)+(6,2) = (8,7).

<p> In words, the addition rule is simple add the rectangular coordinates
   ofthe summands to get the rectangular coordinates of the sum. With
   this inmind, the following question is easy: What are the rectangular
   coordinates ofthe sum of (1,14) and (2,8)? Answer: (1,14)+(2,8) =
   (1+2,14+8) = (3,22). Thechapter Arrow Addition discusses the addition
   of points or arrows inthe plane further.

<h> Multiplication

<p> Next we define using polar coordinates the product of two points in
   theplane. Each point or factor is located by means of angular
   displacement orrotation from the positive real axis, and also a
   nonnegative distance from theorigin. The product of two points is
   given by a third point. Its angulardisplacement is the sum of the
   angular displacement of the factors. Its distanceto the origin is the
   product of the distances of the factors. This is the addthe angles and
   multiply the lengths rule. In polar coordinate notation,
   themultiplication rule and definition is indicated by

<p> [r[1],q[1]]Â·[r[2],q[2]] = [r[1]r[2],q[1]+q[2]]

<p> (As in the previous chapter, square brackets are used to indicate
   polarcoordinates while round brackets indicate rectangular
   coordinates.)

<p> Example. Two arrows are to be multiplied. One has length 1.3 and
   angle22.62^Â°; the other factor has length 1.026and angle 46.97^Â°; and
   so their producthas length 1.3338 = 1.3Â·1.026 and angle 69.69^Â°=
   22.62^Â°+46.97^Â°;and that is it. 

<p> Another Example. The product of the two points [3,80^Â°]and [4, 60^Â°]
   is [(3)(4), 80^Â°+60^Â°] = [12,140^Â°]

<h> Stop For a Summary

<p> The addition of points in the plane is given by means of their
   rectangularcoordinates while multiplication is given in terms of polar
   coordinates. It isan exercise in trig to obtain expressions for the
   rectangular coordinates of aproduct in terms of the rectangular
   coordinates of the factors. See the nextchapter. (Note that while your
   reading of this chapter requires a mastery of thealgebraic way of
   writing and thinking, you could explain with diagrams andexamples
   only, the ideas in this chapter to someone without this mastery. It
   isthe on-paper communication which requires the mastery.)

<h> Introducing the Complex Numbers

<p> Points in the plane with the operations of addition and multiplication
   justgiven are called the complex numbers. The plane with these two
   operations on itspoints is called the complex numbers plane, or more
   briefly the complex numbers.

<p> We will now change to a more standard notation for them. We may and
   oftenwill write the rectangular coordinates z = (a,b) as z= a+ib, We
   will further call the abscissa a, the real partof the complex number z
   = a+ib. We will also call theordinate b, the imaginary part of the
   complex number z = a+ib.

<p> We will say that the complex number z = a+ib is purelyimaginary when
   its real part a = 0. The angle of a purely imaginarycomplex number z =
   a+ib = 0+ib = (0,b) is 90degrees or 270 degrees (modulo

<h> FOOTNOTE: Two quantities x and y are equal modulo a third quantity
     c, if and only if their difference x-y = kc for some whole number
     or integer k.

<p> 360 degrees), depending on the sign of the imaginary part b. When b>
   0, the angle is 90 degrees (modulo 360 degrees). When b < 0, theangle
   is 270 degrees (modulo 360 degrees).

<p> We will also say that z = a+ib is (purely) real when itsimaginary part
   b is zero. The angle of a (purely) real complex number z= a+ib = a+i0
   = (a,0) is 0 degrees or 180degrees (modulo 360 degrees), depending on
   the sign of the real part a.If a > 0, this angle is 0 degrees (modulo
   360 degrees) while if a> 0, this angle is 180 degrees (modulo 360
   degrees).

<h> Real Numbers as Complex Numbers

<p> Each complex number z = a+i0 with imaginary part zerogives and is
   given by a real number a. We will write z = ain this situation, and
   say that the complex number z is also a real number.

<p> With this practice, the real numbers can be regarded as a subset of
   thecomplex numbers; and the real number line can be identified with
   the horizontalaxis of the plane.

<h> Confirmation of The Law of Signs

<p> We identify the real number line with the horizontal axis of the
   plane. Withthis identification, observe that positive numbers have
   angular displacementzero, modulo 360 degrees. Also observe that
   negative numbers have angulardisplacement 180 degrees, modulo 360
   degrees. The magnitude of a real number isits distance to the origin.

<p> Suppose z = a+i0 and w = c+i0. Wewant to compute the product zw with
   the multiply the lengths, add theangles rule. Each factor has length
   |a|or |c|. Each factorhas angle 0 or 180 degrees (modulo 360 degrees).
   The relationships
<l> * 0^Â° = 0^Â°+0^Â°
<l> * 180^Â° = 0^Â°+180^Â° = 180^Â°+0^Â°
<l> * 360^Â° = 180^Â°+180^Â° = 0^Â° (modulo 360^Â°)

<p> imply the add the angles, multiply the lengths rule for
   themultiplication of complex numbers agrees with the ordinary method
   formultiplying real numbers and the law of signs. The relationship in
   particularimply
<l> * (+1) = (+1)(+1) as 0^Â° = 0^Â°+0^Â°
<l> * (-1) = (+1)(-1) = (-1)(+1) as 180^Â° = 0^Â°+180^Â° = 180^Â°+0^Â°
<l> * (-1)(-1) = (+1) as 360^Â° = 180^Â°+180^Â°

<p> Examples and then some further comments may reinforce these ideas. For
   the firstexample, the number 4 is now identified with the point (4,0)
   = [4,0^Â°]= [4,360^Â°]. This number or point hasdistance 4 to the origin
   and angle of 0^Â°,modulo 360 degrees, with the horizontal axis:

<p> For the second example, the number -2is identified with the point
   (-2,0) = [2,180^Â°].

<p> Now multiplying the point [2,180^Â°]by itself leads to the product
   [2,180^Â°]^2= [2^2,180^Â°+180^Â°]= [4,360^Â°] = [4,0^Â°].Thus the point on
   the horizontal axis identified with -2when squared gives the point
   identified with +4 indicated above. The 360 degreesin the diagram for
   the number or point 4 = (4,0) represents the doubling of theangle 180
   degrees.

<p> For an example or exercise, compute the pairwise products of 3=3+0i,
   4=4+0i,-3=-3+i0 and -4=-4+0i using the add the angles, multiply the
   lengths rule.

<p> Remark. The add the angles, multiply the length rule could beused to
   define the product of real numbers to people/students who know (a)
   aboutthe addition of real numbers or coordinates and (b) about the
   multiplication ofnon-negative numbers. They would not need to have any
   previous knowledge of thelaw of signs.

<h> FOOTNOTE: The add the angles, multiple the lengths rule for the
     multiplication of complex numbers thus yields a rule for the
     multiplication of real numbers once the multiplication of positive
     numbers with themselves or zero is understood/defined.

<p> More Exercises. Compute the following using the multiply the
   lengths,add the angles rule:

<l> 1. A = (1.5)Â·(2).
<l> 2. B = (1.5)Â·(-2).
<l> 3. C = (-1.5)Â·(-2).
<l> 4. D = (1.5)Â·(-2).
<l> 5. E = [10,45^Â°] Â·[[1/20],15^Â°].

<p> Note each factor gives a point or arrow in the coordinate plane.

<p> Stop For A Summary. The polar coordinate definition

<p> [r[1],q[1]]Â·[r[2],q[2]] = [r[1]r[2],q[1]+q[2]]

<p> of the product of two point in the plane, involves the multiplication
   of lengths(= distances to the origin) and the addition of angles. For
   points on thehorizontal axis, the angles of the factors are zero or
   180^Â°(modulo 360^Â°). Computing the angle of theproduct will involve
   one of the following expressions:
<l> 0^Â°+0^Â°
   =
   0^Â°
<l> 0^Â°+180^Â°
   =
   180^Â°
<l> 180^Â°+0^Â°
   =
   180^Â°
<l> 180^Â°+180^Â°
   =
   360^Â°
   
<p> Since the angle 180 degrees is associated with -1, and the angles 0
   and 360degrees are both associated with the number +1, the polar
   coordinate definitionof multiplication of points in the plane agrees
   with (or yields) the law ofsigns for the multiplication of positive
   and negative numbers.

<h> Square Root of -1

<p> The real number -1 = -1+0i= [1,180^Â°] has angle 180 degrees (mod
   360degrees) and length 1. The purely imaginary number (0,1) = 0+i1 =
   [1,90^Â°]has angle 90 degrees and length 1. Multiplying this point or
   number by itself,that is, squaring it, gives the point with length 1
   Ã—1 = 1 and angle 90^Â°+90^Â°= 180^Â°. So the product equals -1+0i= -1. We
   call i = the principal square root of-1.

<p> A second square root of -1 is obtained as follows. The imaginary
   number (0,-1)= 0+i(-1) = [1,-90^Â°]has angle -90 degrees and length 1.
   Multiplying thispoint or number by itself, that is squaring it, gives
   the point with length 1times 1 =1 and angle (-90^Â°)+(-90^Â°)= -180^Â° =
   180^Â°(mod 360^Â°). So this product equals -1+0i= -1 as well.

<p> This provides two square roots of -1 as both [1,+90^Â°]^2= [1,+180^Â°] =
   -1and [1,-90^Â°]^2= [1,-180^Â°] = -1.

<h> Square Roots of Other Complex Numbers

<p> The square root of a positive number or zero are real nonnegative
   numbers. Iassume in the following that you know how to compute these
   square roots. Thesquare roots of negative numbers and of other arrows
   or points in the coordinateplane depend on this ability.

<p> Observe that squaring points in the plane doubles their angular
   displacementsand squares their magnitudes (distance to the origin).
   That is, the add theangles, multiple the lengths rule gives

<l> [r^Â½, 1
     _________________________________________________________________

<l> 2
<l> q]Â·[r^Â½, 1
     _________________________________________________________________

<l> 2 q] = [r ,q]

<p> Therefore the arrow [r^Â½,[1/2]q] whensquared (meaning multiplied by
   itself) yields [r,q]. So it is called a square root of the arrow
   [r,q].Another square root is located by the polar coordinates
   [r^Â½,[1/2]q+180^Â°]since [r,q] = [r,q+360^Â°]both locate the same point
   in the plane. You should consider the special case ofpositive numbers
   z = a+i0 = [a,0^Â°]where the angle q = 0 degrees.

<h> Exercises.

<l> 1. Find all the square roots of 4 and -4 and plot them.
<l> 2. Find the cube roots of 27 and -27 and plot them in the plane.
<l> 3. Find the square roots of \cis(45^Â°) = cos(45^Â°)+isin(45^Â°) =
       [1,45^Â°].

<h> Complex Conjugates

<p> The complex conjugate of a complex number z = a+b iwith polar
   coordinates r = Ã–[(a^2+b^2)]and q is the complex number [`(z)]= a-b i
   with polar coordinates rand -q.

<p> *   Exercise. Show multiplying a complex number a+bi by its conjugate
   a-b igives the nonnegative number r^2 = a^2+b^2.

<h> Conjugates and Reciprocals

<p> Observe that p = [(a)/(r^2)]-i[(b)/(r^2)]= [1/(r^2)][`(z)] has angle
   -qand length [1/(r)]. Here p = [1/(r^2)][r,-q]= [[1/(r)],-q].)
   Multiplying number p =[[1/(r)],-q] by z = [r,q]gives the complex
   number [1,0] with length 1 and angle 0, that is, the realnumber 1. And
   multiplication of any point (c,d) by 1 = [1,0^Â°]yields back the point
   (c,d)

<p> The reciprocal (or multiplicative inverse) of the complex number z =
   a+bi with length r > 0 and angle q isthe complex number p with length
   1/r and angle -q.

<p> Observe that if r > 1 then the length of the reciprocal [1/(r)]< 1 <
   r, that is, the length of the reciprocal is less than 1 andthe length
   of the original number. In contrast, if 0 < r < 1 then[1/(r)] > 1 > r.
   Question: Which of these two cases isrepresented in the above diagram?
   What happens in the case r = 1?

<h> Two Algebraic Properties

<p> Observe

<p> [r[1],0]Â·([1,q]Â·[r[2],q[2]]) = [r[1],q[1]]Â·[r[2],q[2]]

<p> since [r[1],0]Â·([1,q]Â·[r[2],q[2]])= [r[1],0]Â·[r[2],q[1]+q[2]]=
   [r[1]r[2],q[1]+q[2]]. Similarly

<p> [1,q]Â·([r[1],0]Â·[r[2],q[2]]) = [r[1],q[1]]Â·[r[2],q[2]]

<h> Real Multiples of Arrows

<p> We said earlier (in the last section of the chapter Arrow Addition)
   forreal numbers a, b and c that cÂ·(a,b)= (ca,cb) without any reference
   to or use of the add theangles, multiply the lengths arrow
   multiplication rule. But c = c+i0= (c,0) gives a point in the plane.
   So we can multiple c = c+i0= (c,0) and (a,b) = [r,q]using the add the
   angles, multiply the lengths rule. Two cases, moreprecisely
   possibilities, will be examined.

<p> Case 1: c Â³ 0 Observe for c> 0 that c = c+i0 = [c,0] has angle 0
   degrees andlength c = |c|.Thus the add the angles, multiply the
   lengths multiplication ruleyields

<p> cÂ·(a,b) = [c,0]Â·[r,q] = [cr,0+q] = [cr,q] = (ca,cb)

<p> as before.

<p> Case 2: c < 0 Now c = -d< 0. But d > 0 implies

<p> (d,0)Â·(a,b) = [d,0]Â·[r,q] = [dr,q] = (da,db)

<p> Therefore

<l> (c,0)Â·(a,b)

<l> =

<l> (-1)Â·[d,0]Â·(a,b) = (-1)Â·[dr,q]

<l> =

<l> [dr,q+180^Â°] = (-da,-db)

<l> =

<l> (ca,cb)

<p> again.

   Conclusion. Multiplication of a point (a,b) by a realnumber c = c+i0
   with and without the add the angles,multiple the lengths rule gives
   (ca,cb).

<h> Some Vocabulary.

<p> For each point or complex number z = a+b i = (a,b)= [r,q] in this
   plane, we say that a isthe real part of z; that b is the imaginary
   part of z;that r = |z|= Ã–[(a^2+b^2)] isthe magnitude, modulus or
   absolute value of z (differenttexts prefer different terms); and that
   q is theangle or argument of z.

<p> Remark. The use of round brackets () in the notation forrectangular
   coordinates (a,b) stems from the conventionin many algebra texts
   written before this one. The use of square bracket [] inthe notation
   for polar coordinates [r,q]here was chosen simply because the square
   brackets were available. Inretrospect, cosmetic appearance alone would
   suggest the employment ofround-brackets for polar coordinates and
   square brackets for rectangularcoordinates. The development of
   notation is not always cosmetically optimal.

<h> Three Problems.

<l> 1. Locate in the plane the complex conjugate and reciprocals of the
       complex three numbers s = 3+4i, t = 12+(-5)i, and z = cos(120^Â°)
       +isin(120^Â°).
<l> 2.  Locate the three complex cube roots of 1 (unity) .Hint: divide
       the unit circle into three arcs each spanning an angle of 360/3
       =120 degrees. The required roots are at the ends of each arc (if
       two arcs share the endpoint 1 = 1+i0.
<l> 3. Locate the fourth, fifth and sixth roots of unity. What is the
       general pattern for n-th roots of unity (where n = 2, 3, 4, Â¼).?
