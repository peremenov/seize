<l> Got 2.3 MW, only a
   few minor trips. This time we had a series of more ELM-free H-modes,
   with
   accumulating impurities and radiation. Not a pretty sight. H/D is up
   to 0.18!
<l> Next shot, lower Ip to 0.9 MW in an attempt to get EDA conditions.

<l> Physics Run plan for
   1010719, MP 287 Asdex H-mode similarity experiment
   
<p> Goal: To make high density, high power EDA H-modes in a shape
   identical to
   that in ASDEX-Upgrade 'Type II ELM' discharges. This regime,
   which was only recently obtained on AUG, appears rather similar to
   that
   obtained on C-Mod when power is increased into EDA H-modes. At reduced
   powers,
   AUG sometimes sees a 'quasi-coherent' mode. We would like to see if
   the same
   behaviour is observed on the two machines with the same dimensionless
   parameters. We will obtain edge profiles both at threshold and in the
   steady
   H-mode period. AUG will then try to match the
   dimensionless parameters (nu*,beta, rho*) of these discharges.
   
<h> Plan:
   
<l> 1) Obtain suitable shape, plasma parameters. Start with shape from
   shot
   1010605016. Raise Ip to 1.0 MA, keep Bt at 5.3 T. L-mode nel=1.1e20
   m-2.
   Once plasma is obtained, adjust shape to get a better match to AUG
   pulse 14265.
   This will involve increasing the inner gap and the radius of the
   x-point.
   RF should use these shots (3-4?) to tune and condition;
   For the last shot we would like a power ramp up to >~2 MW to get the
   threshold power, and both L and H-mode tunes.
   
<l> 2) High power EDAs. Use square wave RF pulse at Ptot=2.5 MW using D
   and E at
   80 MHz (more if we can get it). Measure pedestals, and fluctuations.
   Tune J-port at low power on these.
   
<l> 3) Add power from J-port (70 MHz), at maximum available power. This
   will be
   off-axis, which is non-optimal, but should help to raise pedestal
   temperature.
   
<l> 4) Increase density. A dimensionless match to the best AUG 'grassy
   ELM' shots
   would correspond to a line integrated density of 4.7e20, higher than
   our usual
   range. Increase starting density, and probably puff gas into EDA, to
   see how
   high we can get and still maintain a decent, steady H-mode (and couple
   enough
   power). ECE will probably be cut off, so good ETS data are essential.
   Again, use max available power without and with J-port.
   
<l> 4) Once the 'high density' H-mode has been characterized, use a slow
   power
   ramp to determine the corresponding threshold power and edge
   parameters.

<p> Goal: To make high density, high power EDA H-modes in a shape
   identical to
   that in ASDEX-Upgrade 'Type II ELM' discharges. This regime,
   which was only recently obtained on AUG, appears rather similar to

<h> Results:
   
<p> We had limited success with this run, primarily due to poor machine
   conditions.
   This was probably a result of the recent vent, combined with the fact
   that we
   were running non-standard shapes, and thus putting power on different
   vessel
   surfaces. This led to impurity injections and, most critically, to a
   high
   hydrogen fraction (up to 20%) which limited the RF power absorption;
   H/D
   typically increases during each discharge, with Pabs decreasing.
   
<p> The shape development part of the run went quite smoothly, and we
   did get shots which were a very close match to ASDEX Upgrade shapes
   (see
   physics operator summary for details of changes made). These had
   elongation
   close to our vertical stability limits (k~1.73), and were close to
   double null,
   which may have caused some interaction with upper vessel surfaces, and
   possibly
   also increased H-mode thresholds. The last AUG shaped shot,
   1010719020, is a
   good example (Delta_u=0.34, delta_l= 0.47)
   
<p> J-port was not available for the run after all, so we ran with
   typically 2.3
   MW at 80 MHz from D and E port antennas. However, the low absorption
   means
   that the effective power was actually much lower, especially late in
   the pulse.
   We were unable to get any H-modes which had a steady, EDA character.
   Many were
   ELM-free, with strongly increasing impurities. (eg. shot 2, 14).
   Others, with
   lower power and higher radiation, had periodic behaviour typical of
   Type III
   ELMs; the pedestal was very cold (eg. shots 5,13). On shots 9 and 11
   we ramped
   the RF up slowly to get threshold data, and found it was over the 2.3
   MW
   injected); this is very high for these C-Mod conditions. Making the
   discharge
   more 'single null' had little effect (shot 12). Lowering the target
   density
   from nel= 0.9 to 0.7e20 m-2, while it had minimal effect on nebar at
   the RF
   onset (1.35-1.4e20m-3 in both cases), resulted in much lower neutral
   pressure
   anda threshold of Prf=1.13 MW (shot 13). This may be a good point for
   threshold
   comparison, though it was rather early in the ramp. Shot 14 had full
   RF power
   at this density, and resulted in ELM-free H-modes.
   
<p> In an attempts to favour the EDA regime, Ip was lowered from 1.0 to
   0.9 MA from
   shot 15 on. This raised q95 to 4.2. The rates of density rise did
   decrease
   slightly, though not an obvious EDA regime. Shot 16 had hints of a
   weak
   quasi-coherent
   mode on PCI. Shot 17 was colder and more ELMy. From shot 19 Bt was
   raised
   from 5.3 T to 5.6 T, raising q95 still further and a better match to
   the AUG
   target. This proved more difficult for the RF to match, for reasons
   not well
   understood at least by me, and power was not as steady as the rest of
   the day.
   The density did appear to be getting more steady, and QC modes
   characteristic
   of EDA were seen on PCI. Shot 21, about 0.75-0.8 secs, may be a good
   time for
   pedestal analysis. For shot 22, we went back to a standard shape, 800
   kA shot
   to check we could get EDA there. We did, but it quickly cooled and
   reverted to
   Type III ELMs as H/D rose.
   
<p> In summary, as expected, it was more difficult to get steady H-modes
   in the
   lower triangularity ASDEX-Upgrade shape. However, the poor machine
   conditions
   and low absorbed power undoubtedly were a major impediment, and there
   were
   indications we were getting close. There was insufficient power to try
   raising
   the density. Since the discharge development has been successfully
   completed,
   we would very much like to revisit this experiment on a day with
   better vessel
   conditions and all three RF antennas available.

<p> Better; makes it to 1.47 secs. Three H-modes, and the third is quite
   steady.
<p> However, H/D at this point is 20%, radiation is high and net power
   therefore
   presumably very low.
   
<p> Pedestal Te ~ 200 eV; may be in an intermittent ELMy/EDA regime.
   
<p> For next shot, try to increase RF power. Asked Stu Zweben to delay D2

<p> Disrupted 0.82 seconds. Two H-modes, not EDA. Both end due to rapid
   increase
   of Prad.
   
<p> H/D still very high, though core heating seems OK in this early
   period.
   
<p> Next shot: ramp RF power slowly to get threshold point, and also see
   if
   injections are related to

<p> RF ramp got to 1.2 MW, stayed in L-mode. H/D~8%.

<p> Will increase outer gap a bit to try to improve stability, try ramp
   again.

<p> Made it all the way to rampdown, but with a huge injection 0.75 secs.
   RF ramps
   to 2.3 MW, but

<p> ECE valve was closed.
   
<p> Nice shape match, esp earlier in flat-top

<p> Made it to 1.4 seconds. RF ramps 1.0 to 2.3 MW, as requested. Plasma
   STILL
   stays in L-mode. Why??
<p> Got good central heating, Te0 1.3-2.6 keV.
   
<p> Possibly we are too close to double-null; will change upper x-pt for
   next shot
   and repeat.

<p> VERY similar to shot 11.
<p> Made it to 1.4 seconds. RF ramps 1.0 to 2.3 MW, as requested. Plasma
   STILL
   stays in L-mode. Why??
   
<p> Try backing off on density, replace ~200 kW of D-port power by E-port
   in case
   it is contributing to the
   injection.

   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
<p> Lowering density got us into H-mode, at 0.665 secs, 1.13 MW. H-mode
   was very
   ELMy; low pedestal
   temperatures. RF ramped up slowly as requested, H/D ramped up to 0.2
   (as NOT
   requested).
   
<p> Next shot try full RF power right away.

   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
<p> Got 2.3 MW, only a few minor trips. This time we had a series of more
   ELM-free
   H-modes, with
   accumulating impurities and radiation. Not a pretty sight. H/D is up
   to 0.18!

   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
<p> Reducing Ip to 900 kA increased q95 to ~4.2. Got a somewhat longer,
   steadier
   H-mode;
   not quite EDA I think. A few RF trips; retune and repeat.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
<p> Steady RF on this one, 2.2 MW. For some reason H-modes are shorter,
   accumulate
   more ne and
   impurities. Next shot, increase nel ~ 10%.
<p> Nel was 0.75-1.84x10^20 m-2 on this one.

<p> Appears to be a weak quasicoherent mode partway through these H-modes
   (as seen
   on PCI).
<p> Frequency is lower than usual.

<p> At slightly higher nel 0.87-1.9x10^20 m-2, got into a series of ELMy
   periods.
<p> Temperatures, edge and
   core, drop dramatically through RF pulse, presumably due to high H/D.
   
<p> For the next shot, raise Bt to 5.6 T, as in the original run plan,
   thus raising
   q95.

<p> Still a lot of RF trips. Two H-modes. The first has a steadier
   density,
   though conditions never get
   quite stationary. Period 0.75-0.8 secs is fairly steady, may be good
   to look
   at pedestal parameters.

<p> All profiles, parameters need checking!
   
<p> For next shot, load a standard C-Mod shape from 1010716004, 780 kA,

   a good EDA.

<p> reload of 1010716004 (780 kA, standard shape) does give EDA, at least
   to ~0.8

   temps then decrease, presumably due to H/D increase (8-12 %), and
   discharge
   gets ELMy.

<l> MP 287 AUG Similarity.
   
<l> PO Hutch

<h> Summary
   _______
<p> Shapes that are an excellent match to the scaled AUG shape were
   obtained (e.g. 21) and many were run. A comparison plot is in
   user10:[hutch.ps]aug_match.ps. They are close to double null;
   although a range of three sseps was run without obvious effect on the
   plasma character. No solid EDA H-modes were obtained. The H/D was high
   and rose strongly with RF in the early part of the day. Later on, the
   rises seemed less significant, but in all cases the H/D was above 10%
   during much of the RF pulse. Heating was clearly inefficient in many
   cases. In some others heating was ok even at high H/D.
   
<p> The early part of the day was plagued with injections. Many appeared
   to be caused by visible sparks on the upper left corner of D-antenna.
   Some others were not RF induced. As the day wore on, these problems
   were less severe, and the plasma ran reasonably reliably.
   
<p> These shapes are fairly close to stability limits. One or two VDEs
   were
   experienced. The chopper V was set to 150 to 200 instead of the usual
   0
   to lower the operating average current to a position closer to the
   center
   of its range. This adjustment seemed to be a significant improvement
   in
   that it allowed operation with an elongation that gave rise to noisy
   chopper
   behaviour without leading to saturations and subsequent VDE.
   
<p> A manual gas puff during the RF did not significantly improve the
   operation, but also did not seem to give much impact on the RF
   coupling
   despite a x2 rise in main chamber neutral pressure.
   
<p> It appears to be confirmed that the lower triangularity that is needed
   to
   match AUG makes it harder to get into EDA. The high H level was also
   definitely a handicap.

<l> Plasma. 3 H-modes. RF tripping. Survives the narrower shape.
   
<l> RF reports a big drop in load during the time the neutral pressure
   is rising. Hence remove the gas puff.

<l> Plasma.

<l> Import segment 2 from 1010716004 a standard EDA shot at .8MA.
<l> The ramp in antenna loading is still strong, apparently. Hence
   we can probably rule out the gas puff as the cause.
