<h> 7th European Regional Meeting in Budapest

<h> Balancing flexibility, stability and security in European labour
   markets
   
<p> Policymakers all over Europe are facing the crucial challenge of
   regulating a rapidly evolving labour market in the context of the
   globalized economy. Will they listen to calls made for greater
   flexibility to overcome what have often been characterized as the
   region's labour market rigidities: employment protection and
   legislation, union bargaining power, generous welfare systems and high
   labour taxation? Or can they place their trust in a "flexicurity"
   model: new ways of balancing flexibility and security in relation to
   employment, income and social protection? "Flexicurity" is one of the
   main issues to be discussed at the forthcoming European Regional
   Meeting of the ILO in Budapest on 14 to 18 February (Note 1). ILO
   Online spoke with ILO employment experts Sandrine Cazes, Alena
   Nesporova and Peter Auer.

<h> ILO online: Has employment become more flexible in Europe?
   
<p> Sandrine Cazes: Research by the ILO and others refutes the claim that,
   as labour markets become more flexible, stable jobs are becoming a
   thing of the past, at least in Western Europe. The employment
   relationship is more stable than is commonly assumed in the
   industrialized world. Indeed, job stability, as measured by average
   job tenure and reflected in the figures for European countries as a
   whole, has hardly changed in recent years, despite the large
   differences between these countries and the persistent segmentation
   between well-protected core groups of workers in permanent employment
   and those in flexible forms of employment who enjoy less protection.
   
<p> Some of the larger countries, such as Germany and Italy, have
   experienced a growth of more flexible forms of employment, while in
   France, Spain and the United Kingdom the growth of flexibility has
   been outpaced by the growth of "standard" forms of employment.
   
<h> ILO online: Does flexibility pay?
   
<p> Peter Auer: Analysis of the situation in Western European countries
   shows that, while they still have a relatively high level of stable
   jobs, job tenure is not necessarily synonymous with a perceived sense
   of employment security. Indeed, many of the countries with the longest
   average job tenure are not those with the best results in terms of
   decent work, which combines elements such as good wages, perceived job
   security and participation in training.
   
<p> These countries, including France, Germany, Greece, Italy and Spain,
   appear to have lower employment rates than the more "flexible"
   countries, such as Denmark, Finland and the Netherlands. While this
   may stem from many factors, including women's employment rates and the
   sectoral distribution of employment, flexibility also plays a role.
   
<p> The interesting fact emerges that a number of countries in Western
   Europe have achieved a high quantity of jobs without sacrificing job
   quality. These countries have the highest employment rates (including
   youth employment), low unemployment, high rates of participation by
   women in the labour market, a good record in relation to the
   transformation of temporary jobs into permanent ones, and among the
   best records of job quality and perceived security.
   
<p> Flexible countries have high employment rates for youth as well as a
   high rate of transformation of temporary jobs into permanent jobs.
   Over a period of three years, around 65 per cent of temporary jobs in
   Denmark and 55 per cent in the Netherlands were transformed into
   permanent jobs.
   
<h> ILO online: Does employment stability pay?
   
<p> Peter Auer: It is often overlooked that a certain degree of stability
   in labour markets, that means a certain amount of long-term jobs, is
   good for productivity and is also at the base of workers' security.
   However, it would appear that, if workers have the confidence to leave
   their jobs and benefit from a high level of protection during their
   transition to another job, they feel less "locked in" in jobs and have
   greater choice of employment, which in turn leads to better matching
   of labour supply and demand. It follows that more than just job
   stability is needed to achieve good employment quality and quantity,
   but that job stability should be at the base of all employment
   systems.
   
<p> It is thus likely that a reasonable combination of longer and shorter
   term jobs, combinedwith labour market institutions which provide
   income, social and employability protection during transitions,
   creates a greater sense of labour market security than stable jobs in
   an uncertain environment.
   
<h> ILO online: Does this also apply to countries in central and Eastern
   Europe?
   
<p> Alena Nesporova: By contrast, the central and Eastern European
   countries have experienced strong movements in their labour markets
   owing to the accelerated pace of job destruction in the wake of
   transition and the limited scope of job creation in the formal
   economy. While the share of traditional forms of flexible employment,
   such as fixed-term and part-time jobs, and even self-employment (after
   an initial increase), has remained fairly stable, there has been a
   rise in employment based on non-labour contracts or work performed
   without a contract.
   
<p> While the use of fixed-term contracts has increased in the majority of
   these countries, their share is still much lower than in EU countries
   - well below 10 per cent of total employment. Average job tenure in
   central and Eastern European countries is quite low when compared with
   some Western European countries.
   
<p> Nevertheless, these forms of labour market flexibility have not, in
   general, served to improve mobility in the formal labour market. An
   acute perception of job insecurity, in a context of generally weak
   labour demand and unemployment protection, appears to be making
   workers hesitant to leave less productive jobs voluntarily and move on
   to more productive ones. This may have important negative effects on
   productivity developments.
   
<p> Moreover, Hungary and Poland, the two countries which have progressed
   furthest in deregulation, are also among those with the lowest labour
   force participation and employment rates in the 25 member States of
   the EU. This shows that deregulation is not the solution for poor
   employment performance.
   
<h> ILO online: To what extent are the social partners involved in labour
   market reform at the national level?
   
<p> Sandrine Cazes: The main point is that labour market institutions and
   policies really do matter. All labour market indicators appear to be
   affected positively by active labour market policies and a greater
   intensity of collective bargaining. Policies to stimulate employment
   promotion and reduce unemployment, rather than pure deregulation,
   should clearly be on the agenda of the former transition countries,
   with the aim of protecting transition to new jobs.
   
<p> Of course, there is no single optimal institutional setting for any
   specific country, since all countries differ in terms of national
   experience, culture and circumstances. Each country must therefore
   consider a wide choice of policy options for creating labour markets
   which offer both flexibility and security. In this respect, social
   dialogue is undoubtedly the best tool for testing the acceptability
   and efficiency of the proposed changes and securing broad support for
   them.
   
<h> ILO online: Should governments' labour market and social policies
   focus on work rather than welfare?
   
<p> Peter Auer: If a system for ensuring labour market security in
   transition between jobs is to be sustained, high employment rates are
   needed, and the system must be based on work rather than welfare. Such
   a system is not without costs, and places a premium on individual
   responsibility, such as the obligation to participate in activation
   measures, which have slowly become standard in many parts of Europe.
   But if the public benefits of such a system of "protected flexibility"
   are widely shared, the costs would appear to be acceptable.
   
<h> ILO online: What action can the ILO take to further promote the
   concept of "flexicurity" at the national and regional levels?
   
<p> Alena Nesporova: "Flexicurity" requires, but also promotes, high
   employment rates. Without competitive enterprises which are able to
   adjust their workforces to market conditions, employment performance
   will be poor. However, as already explained, high levels of labour
   market flexibility per se cannot solve the unemployment problem,
   unless workers enjoy sufficient employment and income security,
   through intensive re-employment assistance, active labour market
   programmes and income support, to motivate them to accept higher
   mobility and flexibility, and facilitate their adaptation.
   
<p> Dialogue between governments, workers and employers on policy choices
   is the foundation of the "flexicurity" approach.
   
<p> The ILO "flexicurity" project covering Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech
   Republic, Hungary, Lithuania and Poland, puts this approach into
   practice and illustrates the different policy responses of the central
   and Eastern European countries to employment challenges.
