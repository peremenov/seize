<p> Residential coordinators will not live in Senior House next year,
   announced Dean for Student Life Larry G. Benedict at a meeting with
   concerned Senior House residents.

<p> "There will be none of these people living at Senior House next year,"
   Benedict said at the Friday afternoon meeting amidst cheers from the
   audience. The coordinator slated to be housed in Senior House will
   instead live at Eastgate.

<p> Assistant Dean for Residential Programs Katherine G. O'Dair said that
   it was impossible to house a residential coordinator in Senior House
   because the the space for the coordinator had already been promised to
   a handicapped student.

<p> Coordinators will also live in Next House and NW30, the new dormitory
   for graduate students which will open in Fall 2001.

<p> Burton-Conner was also mentioned as a possible home for a residential
   coordinator. However, Burton-Conner president Kiwah K. Kendrick '02
   said that the dormitory was unlikely to accept the proposal in its
   current state. Benedict and O'Dair will meet with Burton-Conner
   tomorrow.

<p> The Friday meeting was organized to deal with the negative student
   response to the residential coordinator proposal, which the deans
   announced earlier this month. About 75 students joined Benedict,
   O'Dair, Senior House Housemaster Henry Jenkins, and Director of
   Housing Operations Karen A. Nilsson for the discussion.

<h> DSL will rewrite job description 

<p> Benedict and O'Dair also agreed to rewrite the job description for
   residential coordinators. "The language [in the original proposal] was
   atrocious," Benedict said.

<p> O'Dair added that coordinators would not be granted any disciplinary
   or judicial power.

<p> Under the new proposal, residential coordinators will serve both
   graduate students and undergraduates, O'Dair said.

<p> The original plan included one coordinator for all graduate students
   and three for the undergraduates.

<h> Deans address communication

<p> After announcing the new residential coordinator plans, Benedict and
   O'Dair addressed student complaints about ineffective communication
   between students and the administration.

<p> Dormitory Council President Jeffrey C. Roberts '02 said he had known
   about the proposal as early as December. Dormcon didn't inform the
   public of the status of the proposal because it felt it did not have
   enough details to advertise, said Dormcon Vice President Matthew S.
   Cain '02. "It was basically a big miscommunication," Cain said.

<p> Roberts added that when he was first informed, the proposal "was not a
   plan ... my expectation was that when it became a plan, [the
   dormitories involved] would be be the first to hear. We just had a
   breakdown in communication."

<p> The administration had also communicated with the Undergraduate
   Association and the Graduate Student Council, O'Dair said.

<p> "One thing we've learned is that we need to use multiple communication
   mechanisms, because as it is, the word doesn't get out," O'Dair said.

<h> Students prefer new proposal

<p> Most attendees at Friday's meeting acknowledged that Benedict's new
   proposal was an improvement.

<p> Robin H. Ivester '01, who wrote the summary of student concerns
   provided to Benedict on Friday, said that Benedict's appearance at the
   meeting helped rebuild students' trust in the administration.

<p> "I think what he did shows us very clearly that he's willing to work
   with us, for us," she said.

<p> Other students commended the administration for responding to their
   concerns.

<p> "I was pretty pleased with the outcome of the meeting," said Senior
   House resident M. Maitland Lederer '03. "I was glad to see
   communication [between students and administrators] and not just
   yelling and name-calling."

<p> Lederer added that residential coordinators were "not a bad idea in
   principle" and that her main objections to the initial proposal were
   the original implementation plans and the wording.

<p> "It's clear that Dean Benedict cares about the well-being of the
   students," said Senior House resident Geoffrey L. Goodell '01.

<p> However, Goodell expressed reservations about the administration's
   failure to provide students with a long-term plan. He added that,
   without seeing Benedict's long-term vision, the residential
   coordinator plan seems "like a solution begging for a problem."

<p> Meanwhile, the GSC expressed its support for the new proposal.

<p> "Among grad students, we like the concept of having another person to
   help with residential life," said GSC Housing and Community Affairs
   Chair Shunmugavelu D. Sokka. "Undergraduates have a lot of support
   already, but we favor any help we can get."

<h> Students draft bill of rights

<p> The controversy surrounding this proposal has inspired a group of
   students, led by Lederer, to create a "Students' Bill of Rights."
   Currently in its early stages, the document outlines students' basic
   housing rights.

<p> Lederer said the idea had been tossed around by the UA and other
   groups. "It's not incredibly novel, but it's something that hasn't
   been done yet," she said.
