<h> Rage Event Report: 2001 Prefontaine Classic (Eugene)

<p> Eighteen year old Alan Webb, a senior at South Lakes High School from
   Reston, Virginia, ran a 3:53.43 mile to break Jim Ryan's 36 year old
   national high school record (3:55.3), once thought to be untouchable.

<p> How good of race was it? He basically stole the show from the best
   track athletes in the world. World record holder, Hichem El Guerrouj
   (pronounced "Heeshum El Garoosh") ran the first sub-3:50 mile ever on
   American soil, which amazingly, played second fiddle to the kid four
   spots behind him. El Guerrouj even downplayed his own acheivement.
   Instead, he joined the rest of the appreciative Hayward Field crowd
   celebrating the high-schooler's accomplishment, raising the young
   runner's arm and presenting him to the south bleacher fans. In this
   reporter's opinion, it was one of the most selfless and class gestures
   I have ever seen in any competitive sport. El Guerrouj said the young
   runner could very well become his chief rival. Wow.

<p> Webb came to the Pre Classic under what otherwise would have been
   smothering expectations for anyone his age, coming off of a sub-4:00
   indoor mileanother national high school record. He smiled his way
   right through all of the pressure. When asked by El Guerrouj if he
   wanted to run 3:55 in a hotel lobby meeting a few days before, "Hell,
   yeah!" was his response.

<p> Before the race, he looked relaxed and loose as he warmed up, seeming
   to savor the atmosphere in the House That Pre Built. I yelled to him
   "Go, Alan!" from my third row seat, and he looked over and gave me a
   smile and a nod. After the race, he shook every hand extended to him,
   looked everyone straight in the eye and flashed what will undoubtedly
   soon become a very famous smile on the world stage.

<p> For Pre Classic veterens, Race Director, Tom Jordan summed up the race
   perfectly: "In terms of thrills for one race, this has to be the
   greatest in Pre Classic history." No one would have predicted that Jim
   Ryan's record would be broken; not his coach, not Alan Webb.

<p> Even the news media was not speculating on the possibility.

<p> After a torrid first lap, he was running last. Unlike one television
   commentator who suggested the possibility of a last place finish, the
   trained eyes of his coach and the knowledgeable Hayward Field crowd
   recognized the discipline in Webb's opening lap, resisting the
   temptation to go out with the leadersand the rabbits who went out way
   too fast. "Smart kid," his coach and about 10,000 others were thinking
   at about that time. His split was at 58 seconds. Right where his coach
   wanted him. He reached the halfway point at 1:57 and looked in
   control, now having moved up a couple of spots. On the third lap, he
   continued to run smart, as El Guerrouj, looking like he was not even
   working, continued to widen his lead.

<p> Then, Webb went to work, while this reporter went to sleep (e.g. I
   confess I was focusing on the guy about to break 3:50 for the first
   time on American soil). From where I was, I couldn't see history in
   the making across the track as Webb started his surge. He began his 55
   second last lap by immediately moving into lane two on turn seven and
   passing a couple of runners. On the back stretch, he passed a couple
   of other surprised runners and one even more surprised 10K Truth
   photographer, who was busy snapping shots of El Guerrouj. On the last
   turn, he continued to pick off runners, finishing in an amazing 5th
   place, even wishing he'd held on to fourth. "I can run with these
   people. I was passing as many people as I could. I didn't know who I
   was passing, I just wanted to try to catch as many as I could. Now, I
   want to beat some of these people." Remember that the person talking
   here is in high school?

<p> "I ran pretty fast. Today was a very good day, and I'm glad to have
   done it on Hayward Field. This means everything to me. I did it on the
   track where Pre ran. He was my hero." No chest pounding. No strutting
   around the track high-fiving anyone in sight. In fact, on his way
   around the track, he had the presence of mind to maintain his respect
   for the other athletes, yielding to competitors in the pole vault and
   the start of the women's 200 meters. Is that any good, or what?

<p> "He don't look like no high school dude," said Maurice Green. No
   kidding.

<p> While Alan Webb might have stolen the headlines, there was a lot more
   going on at the Pre Classic:

<l> o Suzy Favor Hamilton, pictured below, (US) won the 1,500 meters in
   4:06.93 (the second fastest in the world this year), with the 32
   year-old calling the win "the toughest race of my career" following
   her collapse in the final 200 meters at the Sydney Olympics. Photo by
   Jeanie Dunn.

<l> o Maria Mutola (Mozambique) won the 800 meters in 1:58.90 (best in the
   world this year) for her 10th win in 11 Pre Classic races.

<l> o Marla Runyan (US) won the woman's 3,000 meter race in 8:44.69 (the
   second fastest outdoor time this year). Runyan pictured above.

<l> o Luke Kipkosgei (Kenya), winner of three of the last four Pre Classic
   races (and holds the Pre Classic record of 13:07.83) beat two of his
   countrymen and American record holder Bob Kennedy in the men's 5,000
   meters. Kennedy, coming off a year of injury resulting from an
   automobile accident which knocked him out of Sydney, appears to be on
   his way back, finishing fourth in a time of 13:19.02. A Pre Classic
   crowd favorite, he gave the crowd a thrill as he took the lead with
   two laps to go, only to inevitably get out-sprinted by the Kenyan's
   with 300 meters to go. Kipkosgei won in 13:13.27.

<l> o Patrick Jarrett (Jamaica) got an undetected head start resulting in an unexpected win (9.89) over
   seven other fast dudes, including Maurice Green (US) in the men's 100
   meters. Jarrett pictured left.

<l> o Patrick Mduwimana (Burundi) won the men's 800 meters with a time of
   1:44.93. Â· Bernard Williams (US) won the men's 200 meters (20.18).

<l> o Terrance Trammell (US) won the men's 110 meter high hurdles with a
   wind aided time of 13.34. (Pictured right, Shawn Logan in blue shirt
   prepares to slap hands with Terrance Trammell).

<l> o Doloreen Ennis-Londo (Jamaica) won the woman's 100 meter hurdles,
   beating Gail Devers (US) in a time of 12.68 (second fastest in the
   world this year).

<l> o Stacy Dragila (US) won the women's pole vault (15' 1 Â½")
   establishing a new Hayward Field record.

<l> o Marion Jones won the women's 200 meters in a wind-aided time of 22.26.

<l> o Amy Acuff (US) won the women's high jump (6'6") and established a
   new Hayward Field record.

<l> o Virgilijus Alekna (Lithuania) won the discus with a toss of 220' 5".

<p> Finally, what did not make the sports page was the results of the 200
   meter "joggle." (e.g. running while juggling). The winner finished in
   an impressive 26 seconds and some change, and none of the five
   competitors dropped any balls! But what did make the sports page of
   the May 28 issue of Eugene's local newspaper, The Register-Guard,
   which published the story of Jim Ryan's record being broken, also
   carried the results of the Rhody Run! Pick up an issue, and when
   you're done reading all about the above, flip back a few pages and
   check out T-Bone and The Rage, baby.

<l> The "Jogglers"

<l> Now it doesn't get any better than that.

<l> And that's The Truth.
