<h> THE SYMBOLISM OF THE UNION JACK OR THE UNION OF JACOB

    
<h> How the Union Jack was formed.

<p> IN A.D.1194, Richard I of Englandintroduced the Cross of St. George as
   the Standard of England, and this remained thenational flag until the
   Union with Scotland. In 1603, King James VI of Scotland becameJames I
   of England, as a result of which the first Union Jack was formed in
   1606 by theaddition of the Cross of St. Andrew which formed the
   background of the new flag. The name "UnionJack" came from King James,
   whose name is "Jacobus" in Latin,and "Jacob" in Hebrew. Then in 1801,
   there was formed the more familiarUnion Jack by the addition of the
   Cross of St. Patrick, sandwiched in between the flagsof Scotland and
   England. Thus the formation of the Union Jack came about as the
   resultof the progressive merging of the inhabitants of the British
   Isles under onethrone, the throne of David. The completed Union Jack
   thus symbolises the RE-UNION OFJACOB.
   
<h> The three covenants aresymbolised by the three flags which together
   form the Union Jack.

<p> We have been studying how Godmade three covenants with His people, the
   fulfilment of which in the Anglo-Saxon raceproves that it is Israel.
   It is remarkable that if we take the three flags in the order inwhich
   they form the Union - Scotland, Ireland, and England - then the three
   flagssymbolise the three covenants in the order God made them with
   Israel. For the sake ofillustrating this, a chart of the three
   covenants (Chart 2) is shownafter the flags (Chart 1) and in
   corresponding order.

    
<p> The first chart shows theselection of Abraham to be the father of the
   specially trained race who would teach therest of humanity how to
   overcome disease and finally death. The mind of Abraham lookedforward
   like a searchlight to the " latter days," when the manypromises made
   to him concerning his seed would be fulfilled. In the corresponding
   flag ofSt. Andrew which forms the base of the Union Jack, the blue
   background indicates that thepower behind the destiny of Abraham and
   his seed was a heavenly or spiritual one, and thatthe chosen race
   would eventually become such a people. The white cross is the signof
   multiplicity and symbolises Jacob's summing up of the Abrahamic
   promises as he passedthem on to Ephraim and Manasseh with his arms
   crossed, and his hands upon their heads.

<h> SCOTLAND-ST.ANDREW


<h> THE ABRAHAMIC COVENANT

<p> With his handscrossed, Jacob passed on the blessings of national
   greatness to Manasseh and Ephraim. 


<h> IRELAND-ST. PATRICK


<h> THE MOSAIC OR OLD COVENANT

<p> which was broken by Israel; the blessings postponed 2,520 years, the
                            need of a Saviour. 


<h. ENGLAND-ST. GE0RGE


<h> THE NEW COVENANT OF REDEMPTION 

<p> made it possible for Israel to become rulers worthy of God. 


<h> THE UNION OF JACOB


<h> ISRAEL RULING WITH GOD 

<p> I have blotted out thy transgressions (broken covenant). 


<h> CHART 2


<p> The second chart shows the first stage in God's education of His
   servant race by the revelation of thedetails of His law and
   righteousness in all phases of life. God promised that if Israelkept
   the terms of the Mosaic Law Covenant, she would then be fit to bless
   the world as Hehad promised her fathers. At that same time, He warned
   Israel that the BREAKING of thelaws in the Covenant would lead to the
   long period of scattering for "seven times." We know that Israel did
   break the Lawand sinned against God, thus showing their weakness and
   inability to rise to the highstandard set. They learnt the bitter
   lesson of their own sinful nature and of theimpossibility of becoming
   God's servant without supernatural aid.

<p> When the flag of St. Patrick wasadded in 1801 to form the Union, it
   was broken in the middle in order to leave a whiteborder showing
   between the red cross and the blue background. The broken cross, of
   course,remarkably signified that Israel broke this agreement with God.
   It showed Israel as adefective people, whose sin and transgressions
   were evidenced by their failure to keepGod's Law. It taught Israel the
   need of an outside Divine aid to mend their own brokenlives - the need
   of a new creation. The Mosaic Covenant reminded Israel all the time of
   BROKENNESS, lack of perfection, and it developed inIsrael A NATIONAL
   CONSCIENCEOF RIGHT AND WRONG WHICH TO-DAY DISTINGUISHES ANGLO-SAXON
   PEOPLE FROM ALL OTHER NATIONS. The fact that the cross is RED typifies
   blood. God allowed certain transgressions of His Law tobe forgiven,
   provided that Israel sacrificed various animals in death. The animal
   thussuffered death INSTEAD OF the Israelite. Yet those
   animalsacrifices went on from year to year and never overcame human
   depravity which causeddeath. But through the sacrifices, God gradually
   revealed His purpose that some day ONE SACRIFICE would be paid which
   would release Israel,not only from temporary disease, but from death
   itself.

<p> The third stage on the chartshows the NEW COVENANT being put into
   operation. When Christappeared at the commencement of his ministry,
   John the Baptist pointed to him, exclaiming,

<p> "Behold,the LAMB OF GOD, which taketh away the sin of the world." -
                               (JOHN 1: 29.)

<p> Lambs had been used in the OldCovenant for many years as sacrifices to
   obtain healing and forgiveness. Now the Messiah,though perfect, would
   himself suffer death as the one sacrificial lamb for Israel and
   thewhole world, that finally all might be forgiven and restored from
   death. Through breakingthe Mosaic law, the nation of Israel died, and
   their Law showed them why they died asindividuals. They were a people
   typified by a broken cross. Their only hope lay in themercy of God
   bringing about a new creation. Then came the next stage in their
   spiritualeducation, the grace of the New Covenant, but Israel had to
   learn first the need of aSaviour before they would accept him and be
   in a position to teach the other nations toway of life.

<p> The third flag of the Union Jack,the Cross of St. George, is the very
   shape of the cross of Calvary, showing that it doesrepre- sent the New
   Covenant of total forgiveness to Israel of all her transgressions.
   Itis a red cross, signifying again a blood covenant. At the last
   supper, Christ passedaround the cup of wine, saying,

<p> "For this is my blood of the NEW TESTAMENT (COVENANT), which is shed
   for many for the remissionof sins." - (MATTHEW26:28)

<p> Christ thus intimated that hisown blood would be shed as evidence that
   the price of death had been paid to redeem Israeland save the world
   ONCE AND FOR ALL. The way was then clear for God's servant to
   becleansed and made perfect for ministry; and He extends the
   invitation to Israel to comeback to Him

<p> "I have blotted outas a thick cloud thy transgressions, and as a
   cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for 1 haveredeemed thee."- (ISAIAH
   44: 22)

<p> "I, even I, am hethat blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own
   sake, and will not remember thysins." -(ISAIAH 43: 25)

<p> When the cross of England is placed over the broken cross of Ireland to
   form the Union, the above scriptures aredramatically symbolised. The
   broken cross, which, we have seen, represents the brokenMosaic
   Covenant, IS BLOTTEDOUT. In the Union Jack, thebroken portion is still
   there, but covered up by the cross of England. This
   perfectlysymbolises the fact that the cross of Calvary covers and
   blots out the transgressions ofIsrael. In spite of the fact that
   Israel disobeyed God, and broke His laws, resulting indispersion, God
   has promised to "remember their sin no more." How well the completed
   Union Jackdemonstrates that God has blotted out Israel's
   transgressions through the death of Christ.

<p> Thus the British peoples, who own the Union Jack, are particularly the
   nations of the Covenants, or the "CovenantPeople," now rapidly nearing
   the consummation of their spiritual education andpreparation as God's
   servant nation. Soon Israel will be fully UNITED WITH GOD as His
   sonsto bless all nations. When Jacob of old prevailed with God at
   Peniel, the Lordchanged his name to "ISRAEL" which means "aprince or
   son of God."

<p> "And he said unto him, What is thy name ? . . . Thy name shall be
   called no more Jacob, but ISRAEL , FOR AS APRINCE HAST THOU POWER WITH
   GOD AND WITH MEN AND HAST PREVAILED." - (GENESIS32: 24-28)

<p> Parallel with the formation of the Union Jack, more and more of Jacob's
   descendants have become experimentally sons ofGod, truly God's ISRAEL.
   During the days of England under theCross of St. George, there
   commenced the abandonment of idolatry, and the start of theProtestant
   Reformation. In the days of the Union between England and Scotland,
   there camethe deeper spiritual awakening in the Wesleyan revivals.
   Then, under the completed UnionJack, there commenced the world-wide
   ministry of the Anglo-Saxon Missionary and BibleSocieties. This was
   accompanied by a fuller Gospel including the truth of the secondadvent
   of Christ, while to-day the Gospel of the Kingdom is being crowned by
   theAnglo-Israel awakening, and the outpouring of the Spirit.

<p> Parallel with this progressive return of Anglo-Saxon Israel to the God
   of their fathers, there has taken place thepromised multiplication and
   expansion of the race over the earth to form theEphraim-British
   Commonwealth of Nations, and the Manasseh-American Great Republic.
   From1194 to 1606, the period of England under the single cross, the
   earth was almostunexplored. Toward the close of this period, the first
   attempts at colonisation were madein America. But most important of
   all, England defeated the Spanish Armada, which gave herdominion of
   the sea, the sure foundation of England's future greatness. In the
   nextperiod, under the elementary Union Jack, 1606 to 1800, the British
   Empire was born by theconquest of India and Canada, and by the
   annexation of eastern Australia; while the UnitedStates emerged by the
   Declaration of Independence. Then the third and final period underthe
   completed Union Jack, 1801 to 1941+ has witnessed the full development
   of the BritishCommonwealth of Nations and the great Republic of the
   United States of America. We nowlook forward to the coming re-union of
   Britain and America, and to the unification of thewhole house of
   JACOB-ISRAELUNITED WITH GOD, to bless allnations.

<h> Psalm 60: 4

<l> 'Tis thy flag and my flag,
<l> The best of flags on earth.
<l> So cherish it my children
<l> It's yours by right of birth.
<l> Your fathers fought,
<l> Your fathers died,
<l> To raise it to the skies
<l> And we like them must never yield
<l> But keep it flying high.
