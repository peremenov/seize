<h> Go figure... -- 1 year ago

<p> There are several aspects of parenting that I think are so crucial to
   strive for. I have tried to teach my children, through words and
   action, that we are all human beings, regardless of color, gender,
   race, religion, handicap, sexual identity, even of status (or the lack
   thereof.) I have 3 sons, ages 24, 22, and 8, and all three know that I
   accept, embrace and love them unconditionally regardless of who they
   are or what they do in life or who they love. I have been reproached
   by more than a few people for being open and honest about such issues
   as religion and justice and especially homosexuality. I have long said
   to them that it is not who you love, but that you love. I could go on
   and on about all the things I hope to be and do for my sons, but there
   is one other issue that I feel very stongly about that I just can't
   leave unsaid.

<p> I think that we, as parents, need to listen to our children when they
   talk to us, and that we give their thoughts and ideas the respect and
   attention they deserve. One experience I had a couple of years ago is
   the perfect example of that. There was a little boy in K-Mart, he was
   maybe 4 or 5, and he was in line in front of me in the garden
   department with his mom. He had something in his hand to show her, and
   he kept tugging her shirt and saying "Mama. Mama. Mama. Look, Mama,
   look at what I found." Over and over and over again, but she never
   even turned her head to look, let alone respond. I was getting really
   pissed by then, but he was so sweet and patient, and just kept it up,
   "Mama, mama, mama..." until finally she whirls around and shouts
   "Jesus Christ! WHAT??" and he holds out his hand and she heaves this
   huge sigh as if the effort was almost too much for her to bear, and
   she glances at the object on his outstretched palmÃ¢and then slaps the
   object from his hand and yells "What are you picking that shit up
   for?? Haven't I told you not to pick up every damn rock you see?? Now
   your hands are filthy..." His little face fell and I am about ready to
   open my big mouth when he says, while searching for the pebble, "But
   mama, it's shaped like a heart. I found it just for you." OMG! I had
   to turn away so I didn't bawl in front of him. By now she had turned
   away from him again, and when he found the pebble he held it toward
   her again and said "See, Mama?" and she says "I THOUGHT I JUST TOLD
   YOU NOT TO PICK THAT SHIT UP!" I swear I was ready to knock her teeth
   down her throat, and I am not a violent person! So now I am trying to
   keep control of me, and I knelt down and asked him if I could see the
   rock. His face lit up like a Christmas tree, and he held it out to me
   and said, with a voice amazingly still full of love and pride, "It's
   shaped like a heart! I got it for my mom." So I oohed and ahhed over
   it and told him I thought it was the best gift a little boy could give
   a mom, and if my son had found one for me I would keep it forever and
   ever. Oh, my, but he just beamed! It absolutely broke my heart, and as
   soon as I got finished with my purchase I went out to my car and cried
   like a baby. I wept for that sweet kid, and for his mom too, because
   she never did look and she never did acknowledge him other than to
   tear him down.

<p> To me, it's all about being human.

<h> That's a sad story

<p> That boy was lucky to have you there. I think I would have said
   something to that lady or better yet, I would have followed her home
   so that I could write an nice letter to her reminding her of her
   behavior.
<p> The next time you are in that situation, don't feel that you have to
   clam up. She needed an attitude adjustment and you had the opportunity
   to give it to her.

<p> One time a guy came flying down our side street (which has a lot of
   kids on it) at about 50mph rushing to catch a train. I hopped in my
   truck and raced after him. I found him and I let him have a good piece
   of my mind. I did it in a strong but if you can believe it, courteous
   manner. I believe that he was truly sorry for doing it. He looked
   stunned and embarrassed.

<p> Actually, I do speak up more than I used to, and yes, it is worthy of
   my list! I have a big mouth and a hot temper, and growing up I learned
   from my mom, who is mentally ill, that when you get backed into a
   corner, or the line is crossed as it was in that incident, to come out
   fighting and fight dirty...the object is to win at any cost. Well, as
   I have gotten to this ripe old age of 44, I have learned along the way
   that it really isn't a good method, and it has taken me years (!!!) to
   learn how not to do it. However! Sometimes, when I get REALLY angry, I
   can and will respond that way...and the best option is to keep my
   mouth shut...

<p> That said...in the last few years I have become more and more
   outspoken, in a calm, collected, but firm way, like you alluded to.
   For instance, I had an aquaintence that was telling me a story and she
   popped off with the "n" word...jezus crist in a sidecar! my mouth
   literally dropped open and I said (in front of her boyfriend and kids
   and a couple of friends) "I CANNOT believe that just came out of your
   mouth!" She stuttered and tried to poo-poo it, but I wasn't going
   there. I said "what would posess you to say that?" and I stood there
   waiting for an answer. and she tried to worm out of it, and said `its
   just an expression" and I said "well its not a very good one! it is
   degrading and ugly and absolutely not necessary. period." and her
   daughter, about 9 or so, pipes up and says "mommy, it is the worst bad
   word there is." and her eyes are getting all teary. I told her she was
   teaching her kids, every time it "slipped" out that it is okay if it
   just slips out, and it is not. and i ended our conversation by telling
   her she was showing every person within earshot what she was all
   about, be it stupidity, ignorance, or just apathy, and it wasn't okay.
   and i left her with her mouth hanging open!

<p> I have another example, but i will make an entry out of it. I looked
   at your list and i want to go read in more detail...you have some good
   stuff there!

<p> I belive that you are a great mom!
<p> Just by giving your kids a chance to speak out, and be whatever they
   might want to, it really is a beutifull thing and I hope they
   apreciate that, because sadly not every one gets to be that lucky.
<p> My parents are awsome, they always heard me even when all I had to say
   was BS, and they were very smooth to show otherwise, you know?
<p> I hope that the litle kid`s mother realize that before it`s too late
   and their relationship turns to shit.
<p> PMSANDVODKA is a hell of mixture, I`ve been around it... but at times
   it was actualy good because the vodka would put her to sleep, guess
   who was happy when that happened?
<p> Well, I wish you and your family the best luck... Take care!!!
