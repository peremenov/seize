<h> Leadership Lessons: Negotiating for Success - Basic Stages (Part 1 in a
series of 3)

<p> Everyone negotiates. We negotiate with family members about how to
   spend vacation time; we negotiate with friends about how to pick up
   the tab for dinner; we negotiate with contractors about when to come
   to the house for a delivery or repairs. Physicians negotiate with
   patients when discussing alternatives of medical versus surgical
   therapy or, often times, no therapy. Scientists negotiate for time and
   space to conduct experiments. All of us negotiate for salary and job
   responsibilities. While each of these examples has a different level
   of risk and impact on the outcome, each requires basic communication
   skills to be effective.

<p> Richard Shell, in his book, Bargaining for Advantage (Penguin Books,
   1999) defines negotiation as "an interactive communication process
   that may take place whenever we want something from someone else or
   another person wants something from us." Shell describes the process
   in four stages: Preparation, Exchanging Information, Bargaining, and
   Closing and Commitment.

<p> This article explores the four phases using examples from common
   interactions of faculty negotiating for new positions in medical
   schools. The examples are drawn in part from vignettes discussed
   during sessions on negotiation during the 2004 AAMC Annual Meeting and
   the 2004 Executive Development Seminar for Associate Deans and Chairs.

<h> Four Stages

<h> Preparation

<p> Dr. Steven Blum, in his instruction on negotiation during this year's
   AAMC Executive Development Series, reiterates: You will be a better
   negotiator if you prepare thoroughly. Simple advice, but worth
   emphasizing. Preparation includes researching standards and principles
   by which negotiating parties may reach common ground. Preparation
   includes knowledge of your own values on the issue being negotiated as
   well as knowledge of the perceived needs and values of the other
   parties involved in the discussion. It is important to be aware of
   your own bargaining style as well as that of the other party. (More on
   bargaining styles-avoidance, compromise, accommodation, competition,
   and problem solving in subsequent issues of Faculty Vitae)

<h> Exchanging Information

<p> This is the single most important stage of negotiation. In 1978, a
   study of English labor and contract negotiators engaged in actual
   transactions showed that successful negotiators asked twice the number
   of questions and spent over twice the amount of time acquiring and
   clarifying information than did average negotiators. (Referenced in
   Shell, Bargaining for Advantage).

<h> Negotiating Behavior
<h> Skilled
<h> Average
<l> Questions, as % of all negotiating behavior 21.3 9.6
<l> Active Listening: Testing for Understanding 9.7  4.1
<l> Active Listening: Summarizing        7.5  4.2
<l> Total Information Exchange          38.5 17.9

<p> Many observational studies since 1978 have confirmed the importance of
   these basic communications skills in effective negotiation. Henry Ford
   gave advice on such communication: "If there is any one secret of
   success" he said, "it lies in the ability to get the other person's
   point of view and see things from that person's angle as well as from
   your own." Why are communication skills so important in this
   particular kind of interaction? Shell surmises, "Most people are so
   grateful to have an attentive audience that they take little notice of
   your tactful probing until they suddenly feel the urge to get a few
   answers themselves. By then the effective negotiator has the
   information he or she needs to frame just the right responses."


<p> When Dr. Timothy Johnson investigated the position as Chair of
   Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Michigan, he
   interviewed a variety of decision-makers within the department and the
   medical school. The result of the conversations and his reflection
   upon what possible to build in the medical school was an 18-page
   vision and planning document. This document reflected the visions and
   possibilities of the department and the medical school and required
   very little negotiation to reach agreement because of the shared
   interests and common ground for those with whom he would eventually
   develop the vision. And how did he discover the shared interests and
   the potential for building a great department? Through inquiry,
   listening, clarifying, and developing shared interests.

<h> Bargaining

<p> Bargaining is the stage that most people associate with negotiation.
   However, this stage alone is NOT negotiating. It begins with an
   exchange of terms, an opening of the discussion of a "deal". Dr. Steve
   Blum teaches AAMC EDS participants to delay this stage as long as
   reasonable, but to recognize when it begins. He teachers, "As soon as
   a number or term is mentioned by one party, you have begun to move out
   of information exchange and into bargaining." In negotiations that
   have proceeded well through the stage of information exchange, this
   transition occurs smoothly as a natural extension of how to enact the
   ideas that have emerged. If exchange is done effectively, both parties
   are likely to have discovered a number of different resolutions that
   are more attractive than the ideas brought to the initial discussion
   by either party.


<p> Both parties are also more likely to be pleased with their final
   transaction if they come to the discussion with their very best case
   scenario in mind. The old adage "think positive" is the right one for
   negotiation. King Ching of Chou in the 12th century is reported to
   have said, "High achievement comes from high aims." When negotiating,
   think about meeting mutual needs and desires with complementary
   solutions. Of course, one must prepare well by knowing the bottom
   line, or Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement. (We will talk
   more about BATNA in a subsequent issue.) And, of course it is
   important to know one's values so as not to compromise them. However,
   the best bargaining will result in all parties feeling as though they
   have acquired value and lost little or none. This happens when the
   negotiators spend sufficient time prior to the bargaining stage to
   discover common ground on values and mutual benefit in exchanging
   properties or ideas.

<p> The substantive changes in curriculum that are becoming established
   across the nation are the results of effective negotiation with many
   individuals with many interests. The "bargain" is often a method of
   increasing one department's visibility in return for support for more
   dispersed or integrated teaching. Often, this requires negotiation of
   a new method of distributing funds to departments to recognize
   teaching effort and always a consideration of how these new
   distribution methods impact upon departmental and divisional
   budgeting. Each of these is a result of a bargaining process that
   builds into the larger vision of more effective teaching, learning,
   and organizational innovation.

<h> Closing and Commitment

<p> When various options have been fully explored, weighted by each party,
   and often adjusted, closing may occur. Blum tells us that we obtain
   true commitment from the other party "when the alternatives are not as
   attractive as following through on the deal. " In an effective
   negotiation, both parties will come to this point of best possible
   combination of terms in a similar time frame.

<p> Robert Frost said, "Good fences make good neighbors." A strong and
   visible closing and definition of terms facilitates an ongoing,
   trustworthy relationship. One might say of bargaining, "a good
   contract makes a good bargain-and a potential long term relationship
   that will continue to benefit both parties. In the Unites States, a
   symbolic handshake signifies a verbal agreement. Signing a contract or
   memorandum of understanding or placing funds in escrow shows good
   faith intention to follow through on the agreement. A public
   announcement such as a press release or presentation at an important
   meeting gives credence to the plan.

<h> Summary

<p> "In the last analysis, you cannot learn negotiating techniques from a
   book. You must actually negotiate."
   - Freund, Anatomy of a Merger 1975

<p> The best way to improve your negotiation effectiveness is to be
   conscious of your own opportunities and consciously work to improve
   your skill. Blum credits Shell in teaching that effective negotiators
   share similar characteristics. They all:
   
<l> 1. engage in systematic planning and preparation
<l> 2. have high expectations
<l> 3. maintain a reputation for reliability and integrity
<l> 4. exhibit strong listening skills, knowledge of subject matter,
       verbal skills and self-confidence.

<p> Fortunately, these are all characteristics that are important for
   academic success as well. Whether your focus is clinical care,
   educational innovation, or scientific research, you likely have
   developed considerable foundation in each of these skills and traits.
   Using the four stages, you should be able to enhance your negotiation
   effectiveness. At the 2004 AAMC Annual meeting, Drs. Jayne Thorson,
   Tim Johnson, and Dee Fenner from the University of Michigan College of
   Medicine shared some basic tips for negotiating new positions in
   academics. All rely on the basic stages of negotiation, stages that
   Dr. Fenner describes as "a universal dance with four steps."

                   Jayne Thorson, Tim Johnson, Dee Fenner
				   
<p> 1. Know what you need to meet your goals and establish targets of 6
       months, one year, five years. In discussing a new position, be
       sure to address the metrics by which success is measured in the
       new organization. Ask questions that require a concrete response:
<l> + If I were to take this position, what actions or outcomes
            would make you think of me as a success?
<l> + Who are the successful people in this organization? Why?
            (Then you should ask to meet with them.)
<l> + At the end of one year, two years, five years, how will you
            judge my success?
<p> 2. Use the responses to #1 to construct a 1, 2, and 5 year plan in
       writing. Be sure to state your interests and needs rather than
       making demands. Aim high. Why? "You'll be more likely to hit the
       target".
<p> 3. Find out how decisions are made in the organization. Be sure to
       negotiate with the person who makes the real decisions.
<p> 4. Listen for what is said and what is NOT said. Plan short, clear
       questions in advance and ask with a purpose.
