<h> The defendant as a deaf mute

<p> It was early morning, around 6.30 am, on 14 June 1991, when a warden
   shouted to all the prisoners- "Keep your cell clean and put your
   prison dress on neat and tidy. Sit in the prison and keep silent." We
   all understood that a VIP would visit the prison.

<p> Although we sat in our cells for nearly four hours, no one arrived at
   the prison and we were all very hungry. We tried to ask a warder when
   the VIP would arrive, but he knew nothing and said, "I'm also very
   hungry."

<p> It was nearly 12.00 when we heard a noisy whistle and the sound of
   warders at the main gate. Many warders ran there shouting to us, "Sit
   in prison position and shut your mouths." We knew that the VIP had
   arrived at the main gate. Fifteen minutes later the VIP, escorted by
   many prison officers and warders, passed through our cellblock. Ten
   minutes later, a number of warders shouted to us that we could sit
   easy this meant the VIP had left the prison. We didn't know why he had
   visited. We knew only that we had had to sit in the prison position
   for long hours and felt happy because we would have breakfast.

<p> While we were lying on our mats waiting for breakfast a warder asked
   who Moe Aye was. He ordered me to get out of the cell. My cellmates
   looked at me and I gave them a smile. We understood that if someone
   was taken out of his cell at noon or night, it meant a trial or
   re-interrogation. As soon as I stepped out a white hood was pulled
   over my head. Then I had to follow him like a blind man.

<p> When I arrived in the main gate, someone asked about my background for
   a few minutes. Then I was handcuffed and forced and get into a car. I
   didn't know what kind of car and who was in there with me. After
   driving for nearly five minutes the car stopped and realized that I
   would be sent to the military court, as it was located in front of the
   Central Prison, inside the same compound as the Central Prison and my
   prison. Insein Special Jail. The hood was removed from my head and I
   could see it was as I had thought - I was in front of the notorious
   military court. One military intelligence officer in plain clothes
   ordered me to get out of the car. Two policemen lead me to a small
   room covered with wire mesh. I saw that there were three other small
   rooms and a big hall nearby. I could see the old, dirty wall of Insein
   Central prison from my room.

<p> At this stage I had been in prison for six months, after two months at
   the MIS interrogation centre. It was not unusual for prisoners to wait
   this long before they were tried. Some had to wait for years, such as
   Min Ko Naing, the Chairman of the ABFSU, who was arrested in 1989 in
   but not tried until 1992. During my six months in prison before the
   trial, I was never even sure what I had been charged with. Above the
   cell doors in formation about each prisoner was posted by the
   authorities, stating the prisoner's name, number and the section of
   the Act that the prisoner was charged under. However the information
   about the charges was constantly changed for the political prisoners.
   Sometimes I would leave to take my shower believing that I was being
   charged under section 5(j) of the Emergency Provision Act, but when I
   returned this had been changed to another Act. At times these changes
   happened on a daily basis. For some prisoner ever the nature of the
   allegations changed completely, so that one day they would believe
   they were charged with stealing and the next day this had changed to
   another charge, such as using drugs or even just being homeless.

<p> I believe that the authorities had two objectives in mind by doing
   this Firstly it was a psychological tactic to make the prisoners
   confused. Secondly it was designed to make the warders lose respect
   for the political prisoners, by suggesting they had committed criminal
   acts. In Burmese culture it would be acceptable for the warders to
   then treat the warders with much less respect.

<p> A few minutes after I had been taken to the room a plain-clothes MIS
   officer, a police officer and two armed solders entered the room and
   asked me about my background for a while. The MIS officer said. "Your
   will be sent to the military court soon. Please keep in mind that you
   have no right to complain or make any reply to the military court. If
   you do, your prison sentence will be doubled. Now our commander, from
   MIS unit 7, has already decided to give you five years imprisonment,
   but if you complain or reply with angry words to the court, you will
   be sentenced to 10 years imprisonment."

<p> The police officer also said. "You should keep quiet in the court for
   the sake of your future." Then they lead me to the court. After
   walking for two minutes, we arrived at a large room and I saw that
   there were seven soldiers and five policemen, all armed, standing near
   the doors in the hall. I was surprised that there were so many people
   present just for my trial. There was a low stage at the top of the
   hall, above which hung the Burmese flag, and on either side of it
   large photographs of General Aung San and the dictator Ne Win. There
   were many chairs, nearly 30 or 40, on which some men in plain clothes
   were sitting. There were many ceiling fans and the hall was silent
   except for the noise of the fans.

<p> Then I was forced to sit on the chair nearest the stage. A police
   officer requested me to stand to pay respect while the members of the
   military court were on the stage. Ten minutes later, three
   high-ranking military officers emerged from a small room near the
   stage and stepped onto the stage. At that time a police officer
   shouted for all to stand and pay respect. After they time a police
   officer shouted for all to be seated. He walked near the stage and
   passed some papers to one of the members of the court. I knew that the
   court was made up of three military officers - an army full colonel, a
   navy lieutenant colonel and an air force lieutenant colonel. The
   officer form the army was presiding, and read aloud, "This is military
   court number three and it will hear the trial of Moe Aye. The court
   will be in session twice-to hear the case and to give judgment." Then
   he looked at the police officer and gave a nod.

<p> The police officer stood and loudly read my case. I was accused of
   many things, notably trying to assassinate the military leader of the
   SLORC, trying to kidnap the families of high-ranking military
   officers, trying to smuggle in arms from the borders and trying to
   persuade young students to go to the jungle. I was also said to have
   contacted many groups, most, of which I had never heard of and didn't
   think even existed. The police officer concluded by reading,
   "Therefore I would like to respectfully request the military court to
   give Moe Aye a heavy punishment for his anti-government activities." I
   remember thinking that the crimes I was accused of sounded serious
   enough to deserve the death penalty. After hearing from the police
   officer, the presiding officer of the military court said that they
   would think and decide on my punishment soon. Nobody asked me whether
   any of the charges were true, or if I had anything to say. No
   witnesses were called and no evidence was presented. The court members
   returned to the room they had come from.

<p> I looked around the hall. Soldiers and policemen were standing alertly
   and some police officers looked at the ceiling. Some MIS officers
   sitting behind me looked outside. One army officer was walking near
   the entrance. Then I looked at General Aung San and thought about him.
   I wondered what he would say if he knew about this trial. A few
   minutes later I saw a MIS officer in plain clothes entering the room
   where the military court members had gone. Five minutes later he came
   out again and came over to sit behind me. I realized then that he was
   Captain Kyaw Zin Thet who had arrested me in November 1990. I
   understood at this point that the military court had adjourned to wait
   for him, as he was the MIS officer in charge of my case. Every aspect
   of the country is controlled by the MIS, including the courts. Even
   though Kyaw Zin Thet was just a captain, it was his role to direct the
   tribunal members, consisting of a full colonel and two lieutenant
   colonels, what to convict me of and how many years to sentence me to.
   No doubt that was what he had just done. While I was trying to look
   back at him, a police officer shouted for all to stand to pay respect
   to the court. The military court members took their seats again.

<p> The army officer said slowly, "After hearing these accusations, the
   military court believes that Moe Aye has violated the laws and it is
   clear that he tried to promote the anti-government movement. After the
   1988 anarchy, the milita4ry had to step in and was only just able to
   save the country from falling into an abyss. Moe Aye never thought
   well of the military and had a negative attitude towards it. He tried
   to incite the people by claiming that the military will never transfer
   power. He is trying to destroy the integrity of the military and bring
   about further anarchy like that in 1988. Therefore, according to the
   Emergency Provision Act, section 5(j), the military court sentences
   him to seven years imprisonment with hard labour," The court members
   stood and walked beck into the room.

<p> I was really surprised about the trial, in which I had not been asked
   anything. I had thought they would at least ask me whether I was
   guilty or not guilty. When I tried to look at Kyaw Zin Thet, he went
   out of the hall. Two police officers came over to me and said, "Thanks
   for your peaceful cooperation, allowing us to finish the trial." I was
   surprised again and didn't reply.

<p> Finally I was sent back to Insein Special Jail gate in the car. In the
   car as usual the hood was pulled over my handcuffs, which I had worn
   throughout the trial, removed. When I arrived back in my cell my
   cellmates jokingly asked me how many years I had contracted with the
   junta to hire my room for. I replied "It's a seven year contract." I
   still remember that I had to have my breakfast while my cellmates had
   their dinner on that day.
