<h> Three Strikes Laws A Real or Imagined Deterrent to Crime?

<h> By Michael Vitiello

<p> The 1990s were dominated by get-tough-on-crime measures,
     dramatically increasing the nations prison population and the
     length of prison sentences. Those measures culminated with the
     enactment of "three strikes" legislation around the nation.
     Beginning with Washington State in 1993, by the end of the decade,
     the federal government and over half of all states had enacted some
     form of a "three strikes" law. Roughly contemporaneous with these
     measures, crime rates have declined nationwide. Advocates of severe
     incarceration policies have claimed that "three strikes" laws are
     responsible for that decline.

<p> Nowhere in the nation are the stakes higher than in California.
     Called "the biggest penal experiment of its kind in modern American
     history," due to its distinctive provisions, Californias "three
     strikes" law accounts for the vast majority of "three strikes"
     cases nationwide. Franklin E. Zimring, Gordon Hawkins, and Sam
     Kamin, Punishment and Democracy: Three Strikes and Youre Out in
     California at 22 (2001). Its sentence enhancements include not just
     the widely advertised twenty-five-year-to-life terms for
     third-strike felons, but also a doubling of the nominal sentence
     for many second-strike offenders. Further, its provisions include
     residential burglary as a possible qualifying strike. Finally, the
     third strike, triggering the twenty-five-year-to-life term of
     imprisonment, may be any felony. As a result, California accounts
     for over 90 percent of all "three strikes" sentences nationwide.

<p> "Three strikes" advocates in California point to dramatic declines
     in crime rates since its passage and claim victory. For example,
     former Attorney General Dan Lungrens office reported that "[s]ince
     the passage of Three Strikes, . . . the violent crime rate in
     California has dropped 26.9 percent with a 30.8 percent drop in the
     six major crime categories." Office of the Attorney Gen., Cal. Dept
     of Justice, "Three Strikes and Youre OutIts Impact on the
     California Criminal Justice System After Four Years 3 (1998)."
     Secretary of State Bill Jones, who sponsored the "three strikes"
     legislation as an assemblyman, has suggested that three strikes is
     responsible for most, if not all, of that drop in crime. Justice
     James Ardaiz, who assisted in drafting the original bill, is even
     more explicit: "Crime in California has declined dramatically since
     1993. The only things that are different are more police, tougher
     laws, and Three Strikes. . . . [W]here there are a number of
     explanations for a given result, the simplest explanation is
     usually correct. The Three Strikes Law is that explanation." James
     A. Ardaiz, Californias Three Strikes Law: History, Expectations,
     Consequences, 32 McGeorge L. Rev. 1, 35-36. Jones points to
     additional support for the beneficial role of "three strikes":
     while crime rates declined across the nation, the decline in
     California significantly outstripped that in the rest of the
     nation. For example, over a six-month period in 1995, crime
     declined only 1 percent nationwide while it dropped 7 percent in
     California. Jones, Why the Three Strikes Law Is Working in
     California, 11 Stan. L. & Poly Rev. 23, 24 (1999).

<p> While commentators disagree about whether the law is theoretically
     justified, much of the debate focuses on empirical data. If "three
     strikes" accounts for the dramatic decline in crime, theoretical
     objections, including moral concerns about its fairness, are not
     likely to move legislators or the public. And as indicated above,
     "three strikes" supporters argue that empirical data support their
     position.

<p> However, despite the claims of "three strikes" supporters, the data
     on which they rely do not withstand close scrutiny. More recent
     empirical research supports many of the claims of "three strikes"
     critics that the law simply cannot deliver on its promises and
     insofar as it may have some marginal deterrent effect, it comes at
     too high a cost.

<p> Comparing Californias decline in crime with the national average,
     as Secretary of State Jones does when he asserts that "three
     strikes" accounts for California exceeding the decline in crime
     nationwide, cuts both ways. New York, not California, showed the
     sharpest decline in crime during the time in question. While some
     of New Yorks policing policies have raised serious civil rights
     concerns, it was not one of the states that adopted a "three
     strikes" law during the 1990s. Hence, its decline in crime cannot
     be attributed to such legislation.

<p> A number of recently published studies also raise doubts about the
     true effectiveness of "three strikes" laws in lowering Californias
     crime rate. For example, within California, counties that
     aggressively enforce the law "had no greater declines in crime than
     did counties that used it far more sparingly." See Crime States
     Capture Both Arguments, Contra Costa Times, Feb. 27, 2000, at A1.
     One study found that crime dropped by 21.3 percent in the six most
     lenient "three strikes" counties, compared to a 12.7 percent drop
     in the toughest counties.

<p> A recently published book, Punishment and Democracy: Three Strikes
     and Youre Out in California, reports the results of the most
     comprehensive study of "three strikes" to date. The authors
     findings suggest that, prior to "three strikes," crime rates were
     declining already and, after "three strikes" they continued to
     decline at about the same rate, suggesting that whatever effect
     "three strikes" had, it was small at best. The book also notes
     that, partly because "three strikes" casts such a broad net, the
     offenders arrested under its provisions were no more likely to be
     high-rate offenders than non-"three strikes" arrestees. Nor were
     they more likely to commit violent offenses.

<p> Although its proponents originally explained that "three strikes"
     would work because it would incapacitate high-rate offenders, the
     decline in the crime rate came too early to be explained on that
     basis"three strikes" is a sentence enhancement provision and the
     enhancements do not kick in immediately, whereas the decline in the
     crime rate occurred immediately. As a result, "three strikes"
     proponents were forced to shift their explanationthe law deterred
     potential offenders.

<p> The authors of Punishment and Democracy attempted to measure the
     laws deterrent effect. In certain instances, depending on which
     method the authors used, they did find a marginal deterrent effect.
     But the effect was extremely small and cannot explain the
     significant overall decline in the crime rate. Punishment and
     Democracy also addressed the claim of the laws proponents that a
     sharp decline in the crime rate followed passage of the law.
     Contrary to this claim, the authors found that the decline in the
     crime rate preceded passage of the law. Further, were "three
     strikes" the cause of a significant part of the decline, the rate
     of decline should have increased after its passage. Instead, the
     rate of decline remained constant, suggesting that the causes of
     the decline that were operating prior to the passage of the law
     continued to be the primary reason for the drop in crime rates.

<p> Empirical studies suggest that California would have experienced
     virtually all of its decline in crime without "three strikes." At
     the same time, "three strikes" will have a significant cumulative
     effect on the size of the prison population, an expense that will
     grow over time. One effect will be to increase the number of older
     prisoners, a group that represents a low social risk because most
     offenders become less criminally active as they age. Not only are
     older prisoners not likely to commit crimes if set free, but they
     cost the state much more to keep incarcerated than younger,
     healthier offenders.

<p> None of this comes as a surprise to many commentators who doubted
     the wisdom of "three strikes," certainly as it was enacted in
     California. But none of us who opposed "three strikes" can take
     much comfort in knowing that our concerns were borne out. The
     important policy question is how can we reform the law to avoid its
     excesses?

<p> Few politicians were willing to oppose "three strikes" during its
     passage. And while most politicians in the past decade have feared
     being labeled as soft on crime, that fear was exacerbated during
     the legislations passage. Aided by the kidnapping and murder of
     young Polly Klaas, Mike Reynolds, the father of a murder victim,
     pushed the bill through the legislature with remarkable resolve. He
     was unwilling to compromise or allow amendments to the bill (or to
     a virtually identical ballot initiative). His sway with the
     legislature was extraordinary, with most afraid that if they
     opposed him, he would portray them as soft on crime. Since the laws
     passage, passions have cooled somewhat. But one legacy of the
     charged political environment in which the law passed is that its
     amendment requires a supermajority. As a result, even those few
     politicians who are now willing to propose amendments face an
     uphill battle at best.

<p> In theory, both the California and the U.S. Constitutions protect
     against the imposition of disproportionate criminal penalties. But
     outside of the death penalty context, that protection is more
     theoretical than real. During the 1970s and 1980s, the California
     Supreme Court was active in reviewing indeterminate sentences and
     developed a body of case law wherein it overturned numerous
     sentences as excessive in violation of Californias protection
     against "cruel or unusual punishment." See, e.g., People v. Dillon,
     668 P.2d 697 (1983). A number of trial courts relied on that case
     law in striking down some of the more extreme "three strikes"
     sentences shortly after the law became effective. Despite supreme
     court precedent and considerable sentiment among trial courts that
     some "three strikes" sentences were excessive, no California
     district court of appeal agreed. See, e.g., People v. Ayon, 53 Cal.
     Rptr. 2d 853 (Ct. App. 1996). In light of unanimity among the
     district courts of appeal, the California Supreme Court has shown
     no inclination to revisit the question.

<p> More recently, in a denial of certiorari, four U.S. Supreme Court
     justices suggested that some "three strikes" sentences might
     violate the Eighth Amendments prohibition against cruel and unusual
     punishment. Riggs v. California, 525 U.S. 1114 (1999). Since then,
     the Ninth Circuit has held in three separate cases that a "three
     strikes" offense violates the Eighth Amendment. Andrade v. Attorney
     General of California, 270 F.3d 743 (9th Cir. 2001) and see Three
     Strikes Ruled Unjust in Shoplifting ConvictionsU.S. Appeals Court
     Decision May Reduce Terms for 340 Inmates, S.F. Chron., Friday,
     Feb. 8, 2002, at A-1.

<p> Meaningful review of "three strikes" sentences might weed out many
     of the cases in which twenty-five-year-to-life sentences seem
     excessive. But two important questions remain. First, even the
     Ninth Circuits decisions may be severely limited in their scope.
     All three cases decided thus far have involved petty theft as the
     third strike offense. Under California law, petty theft is a
     "wobbler," an offense that may be a misdemeanor or a felony. Under
     the circumstances of the cases before the court, the offenders
     records have led to the crime being treated as a felony. Once
     escalated to a felony, the crime becomes the third strike. The
     effect of the unique features of Californias sentencing laws is
     that what might be a misdemeanor ends up resulting in a life
     sentence. If the Ninth Circuits approach turns on that feature of
     the law, the impact of these cases is quite limited, perhaps to as
     few as 300-350 cases out of over thousands of "three strikes"
     cases. For example, if so limited, the Ninth Circuits approach
     would offer little hope for an offender whose third strike was a
     minor possession of narcotics or marijuana offense.

<p> The other important question is whether the Ninth Circuits
     decisions will survive U.S. Supreme Court scrutiny. Earlier this
     year, the Supreme Court granted Californias petition for a writ of
     certiorari. As indicated earlier, four justices raised concerns
     about "three strikes" sentences, again in the context of a theft
     "wobbler" case. But whether a fifth justice would agree is open to
     serious question.

<p> The Supreme Court has overturned a term of imprisonment as a
     violation of the Eighth Amendment in only one case. In Solem v.
     Helm, 463 U.S. 277 (1983), the Court struck down a true life
     sentence imposed on a habitual offender whose criminal record,
     although extensive, did not include any crimes of violence. The
     offense that triggered the life sentence was for writing a bad
     check, an offense described by the Court as passive and nonviolent.
     Although a majority of the Court refused to overrule Helm when it
     next considered the question, the Court did uphold a true life
     sentence for possession of more than 650 grams of cocaine. Harmelin
     v. Michigan, 501 U.S. 957 (1991). In addition, prior to Helm, the
     Court upheld a parolable life sentence in Rummel v. Estelle, 445
     U.S. 263 (1980), and a sentence of forty years for possession of
     marijuana in Hutto v. Davis, 454 U.S. 370 (1982). Were the Court to
     apply that case law to "three strikes," whether it would find any
     given sentence a violation of the Eighth Amendment is uncertain.

<p> "Three strikes" requires a significant minimum sentence, one that
     can be reduced by at most 20 percent for good time. Hence, a "three
     strikes" offender must serve a minimum sentence of at least twenty
     years. That may seem significant, and in some rough sense,
     disproportionate to an offenders third-strike offense (for example,
     possession of a small amount of drugs). But the punishment is less
     severe than, say, the offender in Hutto v. Davis, whose forty-year
     sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive. Instead, like
     Rummel, the offender in Rummel v. Estelle, the offender is not
     condemned to a true life sentence. Even if the long minimum
     sentence has the practical effect of a true life sentencefor
     example, when it is imposed on an older offender who as a practical
     matter will probably die in prison before serving his entire
     sentencethe case may not come within Solem v. Helm. While the Court
     struck down a sentence imposed on a habitual offender, his entire
     criminal record did not include a crime of violence. At least for
     those offenders whose earlier crimes have included crimes of
     violence, their earlier criminal records may be enough to take them
     out of Helms narrow holding. Perhaps an older offender whose
     minimum sentence may be the equivalent of a life sentence and whose
     two strikes were residential burglaries and whose third strike is a
     relatively minor offense, like possession of drugs, could invoke
     Eighth Amendment protection. But those cases may be too few to have
     much of an impact on the problem created by "three strikes."

<p> The issue bears watching. Excessive punishment raises serious moral
     questions. Beyond the moral question, "three strikes" opponents
     have mounting empirical evidence that "three strikes" cannot
     deliver on its overblown promises. But legislative reform,
     difficult under normal circumstance due to politicians fears of
     being labeled soft on crime, is doubly difficult because of the
     supermajority requirement. We are left hoping that the courts will
     save us from our own excesses; whether they will is very much up
     for grabs.
