<h> Summary:
<p> Studies show that reactions of top people in sport are faster than
   consciousness can register. How can you get to such a lightning
   reflex? Richard Passingham, Professor of Psychology at Oxford
   describes some remarkable experiments.

<h> Transcript:
<p> Robyn Williams: Have you checked the whereabouts of your left leg
   recently? Does it have a mind of its own like Peter Sellers arm in Dr
   Strangelove, always trying to give the Nazi salute irrespective of its
   owners intentions. Intention, thats the word for this evenings
   conversation. Its with Professor Dick Passingham whos a psychologist
   at Oxford and who likes to play tricks on us and our limbs, to see how
   the brain controls them. Or doesnt like when you think your arm or leg
   belongs to someone else.
   
<p> Do you believe for example that you could be tricked into thinking
   that a dummy arm is actually your own? Its something Professor
   Passingham does all the time.
   
<p> Richard Passingham: Its an illusion that was discovered by a man
   called Bogunovic in America and he was interested as we are in how we
   know that our body belongs to ourselves because there are patients who
   actually with particular lesions in their brain think that the left
   hand side of their body belongs to somebody else.
   
<p> The illusion involves the following. You have your arm, your right
   arm, under cover and on top of it a rubber arm. Its a prosthetic arm
   so it looks very like a real arm and normally of course you would know
   perfectly well that the prosthetic arm doesnt belong to you. And what
   he discovered is that if you use paint brushes, one to brush your real
   arm under the cover and one visibly to brush the rubber arm, after
   about ten seconds or so you get the illusion that the rubber arm
   belongs to yourself. And its so remarkable that you even think that if
   you were to move a finger that visible finger of the rubber arm would
   move.
   
<p> Robyn Williams: And do you feel the tickle?
   
<p> Richard Passingham: Oh you feel the tickle of course. It really feels
   as if its on your real arm. The illusion happens because theres a
   conflict on the one hand you can feel your real arm and you know where
   it is but on the other hand you see the brush on the rubber arm at the
   same time as you feel it on your real arm so theres a conflict. And
   the brain resolves this conflict by actually making you think that the
   rubber arm belongs to yourself.
   
<p> Robyn Williams: So how did you use this illusion as part of your
   investigation?
   
<p> Richard Passingham: Well I was working with Henry Kerson who comes
   from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden whos now one of the members of
   my group and as always Im interested in letting young people follow
   their own course and he wanted to follow up how we have this self
   concept. Our belief that we know the difference between our arm and
   somebody elses. So what we did was we used scanners. These may well
   now be familiar to your listeners using a magnetic resonance scanner
   we can now image activity in the brain while somebody lies in our
   scanner. So what we did is we got hold of oh I think about 20 people
   and we found out how many of them actually felt the illusion strongly.
   We put them in the scanner and we arranged their heads so that they
   could see the rubber arm directly, we didnt use a mirror, their head
   was slightly tilted up so that they could see their arm. And then we
   carried out the experiment exactly as Bogonovic had, that is we
   synchronously brushed both the real arm underneath the cover and the
   rubber arm which the person can see happening.
   
<p> Now to do the experiment we made use of the fact that there are two
   conditions in which you dont feel the illusion. One is if the brush
   doesnt happen synchronously, if in other words, youre brushing out of
   synch the real arm and the rubber arm then you dont feel the illusion.
   And theres another condition in which you dont feel the illusion and
   thats if you have the rubber arm pointing the wrong way so that its
   fingers are pointing towards your shoulders. So we could look for
   where is the activity in the brain when you do feel the illusion
   compared with these two control conditions.
   
<p> Robyn Williams: And what did you find?
   
<p> Richard Passingham: Well we found that the area that showed the
   strongest activity related to the illusion was an area called the
   pre-motor cortex which is part of your motor system and its an
   important area because it receives information from all the senses. So
   it receives both tactile information and about the position of your
   arm and it also receives visual information. And this area was active
   only in the condition in which you felt the illusion, only after you
   began to feel the illusion and remarkably the more strongly you felt
   the illusion the more strongly this area was active. We got the people
   to rate the strength of the illusion in various ways and as I say
   there was very close relation between how strongly they felt the
   illusion and how active this area was.
   
<p> Robyn Williams: And when you were going outside the conventional
   reaction where you actually have a successful illusion when in fact
   you had the arm going the other way, what happened in the brain?
   
<p> Richard Passingham: Then we found no activity in this area at all,
   these were controlled conditions in which as you say the subjects felt
   no illusion and there was no activity in the pre-motor cortex at all.
   And this is what tells us that the critical area for multi-sensory
   integration that is for the putting together of sensory information is
   in fact the pre-motor cortex. And we take it that the way in which you
   know that your arm belongs to you and not to somebody else is that you
   get both visual information about your arm and you get tactile or
   touch information about your arm and normally these are congruent.
   They tell you the same thing and they tell you that thats your arm.
   But in this case where theres a conflict then vision dominates.
   
<p> Robyn Williams: OK, so bring in the people whove got this misfortune
   where they cant actually recognise their limb how does your study
   affect understanding whats going on with them?
   
<p> Richard Passingham: Well the demonstration of people who think that
   their left arm belongs to somebody else has best been done by a method
   called the sodium amatol method. You inject sodium amatol into the
   right middle cerebral artery and this is done only in patients who are
   getting ready for surgery and its done not for experimental purposes
   but its done to tell you important things about where language is
   represented in these peoples brains. Now when you inject sodium amatol
   into the right hemisphere your left arm becomes paralysed and falls
   from a position as you are asked to hold it upright, it falls down
   onto the bed covers, youre awake at the time. If you then ask the
   people if their arm is OK, they say yes, my arms fine. And then if you
   ask them whose arm is that many of them say its somebody elses which
   is a quite remarkable finding.
   
<p> Now in the sodium amatol case the amatol is injected into the blood
   supply and infuses through much of the right hemisphere of the brain.
   So that doesnt tell you anything about the localisation of activity
   which is why you want to scan because if you scan, you can find out
   which are the critical areas for any particular phenomenon. Now in our
   experiments we found two areas in particular, the parietal cortex and
   the pre-motor cortex. The parietal cortex was more active both when
   the arm was pointing forwards and also when the brush strokes were
   synchronised. But the area that was most critical in the sense that it
   only showed up in the one condition in which you felt the illusion was
   as I say the pre-motor cortex. So what this adds is strong information
   about the location of areas, which are critical for the phenomena
   observed in the clinic.
   
<p> Robyn Williams: Having found those locations can it enable you to help
   the patients so that they can find their limbs again?
   
<p> Richard Passingham: We havent yet got anywhere on that. Now there are
   other examples where illusions have done that. The well-known
   neuroscientist Ramachandran has been interested in an allusion by
   which if your arm is cut off, lets say from the elbow lets say due to
   an accident you may go on feeling your forearm and you may think its
   there. And this is an illusion because the arm isnt there and theres
   been a lot of interest in why you feel this illusion. And hes indeed
   scanned people using a method called magneto encephalography to see
   whats happening in their brain under this illusion. But then being the
   ingenious man he is hes gone on to think of ways in which he might
   treat people and hes done this using mirrors.
   
<p> Robyn Williams: And in those experiments Dick Passingham was just
   referring to Dr Ramachandran showed the patients themselves in a
   mirror and told them that their real arm, not the amputated arm, was
   the one that felt the pain and treated them normally and the pain went
   away. The brain in other words believed the mirror trick and you may
   have heard Rama as hes know talking to Natasha Mitchell on All in the
   Mind on ABC Radio National a couple of weeks ago about this.
   
<p> Well Professor Richard Passingham is using scanners to help solve
   another problem, that of intention. Imagine facing Bret Lee bowling
   super fast and how quickly you need to respond with a cricket bat. In
   fact its quicker than the brain seems to be able to handle yet it does
   so how?
   
<p> Richard Passingham: Well the interest of the difference between
   automatic actions and those that we think about is being central to
   our research. Philosophers have for a long time said that they think
   voluntary actions are preceded by an intention and the very well known
   psychologist and philosopher William James early in the century or at
   the end of the last century in his classic book talked about these as
   willed actions. The suggestion being that they are preceded by an act
   of will. Now its been very difficult to do research on that but in a
   classic experiment carried out in 1983 the neuroscientist Benjamin
   Libet thought of a way of actually timing when you feel the intention.
   
<p> Now he did this using a clock face. So the person is sitting there and
   in front of them is a clock and a spot is going round the outside of
   the clock fairly quickly, rotating round. The person is then asked
   simply to move their forefinger whenever they want. They might do it
   after 15 seconds, or 9 seconds or 3 seconds its up to them; a typical
   voluntary action. What he then did was ask the people when they felt
   the intention to move they should remember where the spot was on the
   clock face and that tells you when they were first aware of their
   intention to move. Now his classic finding and the one that puzzled
   people was that you can record electrical activity from the brain from
   the scalp using either EEG or electro encephalograph about a second
   before a voluntary action it can be more. But people normally report
   the intention to move about 200 milliseconds before they move. So the
   puzzle is that the brain seems to be getting ready to move really some
   time before we are aware that we are going to move and that we have
   the intention.
   
<p> So thats the phenomenon that weve made use of in an experiment working
   in Oxford. What we did was scan people and in our experiment on some
   trials they timed when they intended to move and on some trials they
   times when they actually made the movement. So now we can compare
   activity when the subjects attention is directed to their intention
   with the activity when they are just attending to the movement itself.
   And what we found was that there was enhanced activity in an area
   called the pre-supplementary motor area which lies on the inner
   surface of the brain, increased activity there when you attended to
   your intention. Now the interesting thing is that it had been thought
   that the electrical activity that you can record using the EEG before
   movement has its origin in this area though that had never been
   proved. So what weve shown is that indeed your intention occurs in the
   same area in which the electrical activity occurs about a second
   before movement.
   
<p> What it seems to show is this: Actually the origin of the movement is
   unconscious, youre not aware of it, its occurring well before the time
   of which youre aware. Now that you are aware about 200 milliseconds
   before movement appears to be because the activity is enhanced and
   there seems to be a rule that if we are to be aware of representations
   in the brain the activity needs to be enhanced. So it looks as if the
   original direction for the movement is unconsciously performed by the
   brain and then we become aware of it and thats the time when we say we
   intend it. So you might then say well whats the point of awareness?
   And its been suggested by many that the point might be that theres
   still time to change the movement or indeed to veto it and that was
   proposed by Benjamin Libet.
   
<p> But what really this is relevant for is the whole issue of how much of
   our mental activity were aware of? And if you consider for example
   sportsman, cricketers, a batsman reacting to a bowler or a tennis
   player reacting to a serve then actually its been shown that the
   activity that leads to them responding is activity of which they are
   not aware they dont know how they do it. And we now think that much of
   our mental activity occurs below the level of consciousness.
   
<p> Robyn Williams: Now if you take Viv Richards whos the quickest natural
   player I can think of to get to that point where your reaction is
   right, in other words its appropriate, long before you can know enough
   about where the bowlers going to sling the ball, presumably you fine
   tune, you practice enables you to have an unconscious reflex if you
   like in advance so that you get it right more often than you get it
   wrong?
   
<p> Richard Passingham: Well weve been interested in that and what weve
   done is take the case of piano playing. If you play the piano youre
   aware that at first when you learn the piece you have to attend very
   hard and youre aware of what youre doing, you know which fingers youre
   moving and you are sight reading and it takes a lot of your attention.
   But after practising for many, many hours you can now play the piece
   automatically and you can, in fact, play it while holding a
   conversation; you dont have to attend to what your fingers are doing.
   So weve actually scanned people again using FMRI and we scanned people
   while they were learning a sequence of finger movements. And what we
   found was that at first the prefrontal cortex, which you could regard
   as the top of the hierarchy of information processing, the prefrontal
   cortex is very active indeed. But when the task has become automatic
   and the sequence is under your belt and you dont have to think about
   it then theres no longer activity in the prefrontal cortex. So that
   raises the question well what areas are active when the task has
   become automatic? And one of the areas thats active, though not the
   only one, is the cerebellum which lies in the hind brain. Now the
   cerebellum is very enlarged in the human brain and is involved in the
   learning of skills and motor skills, theres much evidence for that.
   
<p> And what we found was that when the task had become very automatic
   there was activity in the cerebellum and the areas that are connected
   to it. So I assume that what Viv Richards has done over very, very
   many years is go from having activity in his prefrontal cortex as he
   thinks about what hes doing until it becomes automatic and you no
   longer have to think about it and its then performed by other areas of
   the brain. And if you think Donald Bradman as I remember as a young
   man used to throw a cricket ball at a wire and this way by repeated
   practice he got to be able to throw without thinking and a cricketer
   can throw at the bails simply without thinking. And in the lab you can
   show that youre not thinking by asking the person when they are
   carrying out the task to do another task at the same time. Weve done
   that and when you learn the motor sequence youre very disturbed in
   learning it if you have to carry out another task whereas when the
   task is automatic you can do something else at the same time without
   interference.
   
<p> Robyn Williams: So thats how we do it every day, almost without
   thinking. Arent we clever. Richard Passisngham is Professor of
   Cognitive Neuropsychology at Oxford.
