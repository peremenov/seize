        <h>"Mcdonalds worker......older worker dealing with teenagers"

   <p>I had started working at Mcdonalds in October of 2003 i am 41 years
   old
   <p>i had been laid off from a good paying job and was working one part
   time job but needed some extra income First the didnt even have a
   uniform for me i am of average size and not over weight they made me
   wear a womens button down shirt that had no tails to tuck in and i was
   forever being told to tuck my shirt in .
   <p>They let the teenagers get away with murder i was working like a fool
   to clean up cause i was a closer while these kids were throwing french
   fries at each other and buns that were dropped on the floor.then the
   assistant manager who was 23 the only thing she should be allowed to
   manage was her personal checking account was having a bad day and i
   was sweeping up trash from the dining room floor and the threw a bunch
   of fries on the floor at where i had just swept and said here have
   some garbage.
   <p>the worst part was when they made me get down on my hands and knees
   and scrub the basebords in the dining and lobby area climbing under
   the booths and tables i was hired for GRILL work but i was always the
   one doing dishes and scrubbing the resrooms
   <p>they cater to lazy people i had worked there over a month and had two
   breaks the first night i started and on 1 saturday nightand and that
   is against the law it is not like they are paying you for it think
   they hide the people that arent Mcdonalds model material
   <p>in the back i worked with another guy close to my age but he had some
   tatoos on his arms so they hid him in the back too i am balding and
   slightly over weight and my teeth arent perfect so i was more or less
   a garbageman
   <p>one young teenagers aspically made fun of me constantly saying he
   wasnt as stupid as I looked so i told the store manager nothing
   happened so i told the kid when you turn 18 im coming back to kick
   your ass he never bothered me again I told the store manager you may
   let them kids make fools out of you but they wont do it to me you will
   just about do anything to make money when you have a mortgage to pay
   but not work for mcdonalds
