 <p>Chapter 4. Employment Measures and 
      Classifications 
      <h>INTRODUCTION

      <p>4.1 There are a number of measures and classifications related to 
      employment. Those discussed in this chapter include: status in employment; 
      occupation; hours of work; full-time/part-time status; 
      permanent/temporary/casual status; adult/junior status; 
      managerial/non-managerial status; employment type; and other measures of 
      working arrangements including details of shift work, overtime etc.


      <h>STATUS IN EMPLOYMENT

      <p>4.2 The status in employment classification is available from most ABS 
      household surveys producing estimates of employment, including the Labour 
      Force Survey, the Census of Population and Housing, and most Special 
      Social Surveys. The status in employment classification is not available 
      from business surveys producing estimates of employee jobs. However, as 
      discussed in Chapter 3, estimates of employee jobs from business surveys 
      are related to, but not the same as, estimates of persons in paid 
      employment (employees) from household surveys. 

      <p>4.3 The Australian status in employment classification is based on the 
      ILO's resolution (Fifteenth ICLS 1993) concerning the International 
      Classification of Status in Employment (ICSE-93). The ICSE classifies job 
      holders according to the type of economic risk held between the job holder 
      and other persons or legal organisations. The distinction between paid 
      employment jobs and self-employment jobs is central to the classification. 
      Paid employment (employee) jobs are those where remuneration is not 
      directly dependent on the profits of the unit for which the job holder 
      works. Self-employment jobs are those jobs where remuneration depends 
      directly on the profits (or future profits) derived from the goods and 
      services produced. The ICSE distinguishes five groups: employees (paid 
      employment jobs) and four types of self employment jobs: employers; own 
      account workers; contributing family workers; and members of producers' 
      cooperatives.

      <p>4.4 The Australian status in employment classification classifies job 
      holders according to their perception of the relationship between 
      themselves and the enterprise for which they work, together with the legal 
      status of the enterprise where this can be established. The ICSE group 
      "members of producers' cooperatives" is excluded from the Australian 
      classification due to its lack of relevance in the Australian context. The 
      groups distinguished in the Australian classification are:

        <p>employee - a person who works for a public or private employer and 
        receives remuneration in wages, salary, a retainer fee from their 
        employer while working on a commission basis, tips, piece-rates, or 
        payment in kind; or a person who operates his or her own incorporated 
        enterprise with or without hiring employees;
        <p>employer - a person who operates his or her own unincorporated economic 
        enterprise or engages independently in a profession or trade, and hires 
        one or more employees;
        <p>own account worker - a person who operates his or her own unincorporated 
        economic enterprise or engages independently in a profession or trade, 
        and hires no employees; and
        <p>contributing family worker - a person who works without pay in an 
        economic enterprise operated by a relative. 
      <p>4.5 The legal status concept is used to classify owner-managers of 
      incorporated businesses as employees rather than as employers or own 
      account workers, for consistency with Australian National Accounts 
      practice. Individuals who work in their own business are queried about the 
      legal status of the business. Although they may 'own' the business, if it 
      is incorporated the individual is not held personally liable for the 
      economic enterprise should it become insolvent. Those individuals who own 
      an incorporated business, with or without hiring one or more employees, 
      are therefore classified as employees. If the business is unincorporated 
      (and hence the owner is liable for the economic enterprise), those who 
      hire employees are classified as employers and those who do not are 
      classified as own account workers. 

      <p>4.6 The Australian status in employment classification is illustrated in 
      diagram 4.1.


      <h>4.1 AUSTRALIAN STATUS IN EMPLOYMENT CLASSIFICATION







      <h>OCCUPATION

      <p>4.7 The occupation classification used in ABS surveys is the Australian 
      Standard Classification of Occupations (ASCO) Second Edition 1996. 
      Occupation data are available from the Labour Force Survey (quarterly), a 
      number of supplementary topics to the Labour Force Survey, and most 
      Special Social Surveys as well as the five-yearly Census of Population and 
      Housing.

      <p>4.8 ASCO is a skill-based classification of occupations which covers all 
      jobs in the Australian workforce. Occupation information collected in 
      surveys and the Census provides a description of a person's job and refers 
      to the kind of work undertaken by an employed person irrespective of the 
      industry in which that job is held. Jobs and occupations are fundamental 
      concepts to the classification. A job is a set of tasks designed to be 
      performed by one individual. An occupation is a set of jobs with similar 
      sets of tasks. Occupations are classified according to two criteria - 
      skill level and skill specialisation. 

      <p>4.9 Skill level is a function of the range and complexity of the set of 
      tasks involved. The greater the range and complexity of the set of tasks, 
      the greater the skill level of the occupation. The criteria used in ASCO 
      Second Edition to measure skill level are the formal education and/or 
      training and previous experience usually required for entry to the 
      occupation. 

      <p>4.10 Skill specialisation of an occupation is a function of the field of 
      knowledge required, tools and equipment used, materials worked on, and 
      goods or services produced in relation to the tasks performed. Skill 
      specialisation is used to group occupations according to type, rather than 
      level of skill.

      <p>4.11 The structure of ASCO Second Edition comprises five hierarchical 
      levels: Major Groups (the broadest level), Sub-Major Groups, Minor Groups, 
      Unit Groups and Occupations (the finest level). The Major Groups are 
      distinguished from each other on the basis of skill level, and, where 
      necessary, the broad concept of skill specialisation. The nine Major 
      Groups are:

            <l>Managers and Administrators
            <l>Professionals
            <l>Associate Professionals
            <l>Tradespersons and Related Workers
            <l>Advanced Clerical and Service Workers
            <l>Intermediate Clerical, Sales and Service Workers
            <l>Intermediate Production and Transport Workers
            <l>Elementary Clerical, Sales and Service Workers
            <l>Labourers and Related Workers

      <p>4.12 The sub-major group, minor group, unit group and occupation levels 
      provide increasingly detailed dissections of the broad categories. For 
      further information on ASCO Second Edition, refer to ASCO: Australian 
      Standard Classification of Occupation, Second Edition (Cat. no. 1220.0).


      <h>HOURS OF WORK 

      <p>4.13 Information on hours of work enables: classification of employed 
      persons according to the number of hours worked; classification of 
      employed persons into full-time and part-time status; and the 
      identification of underemployed persons. The general notion of hours of 
      work encompasses a number of related concepts: usual hours worked; hours 
      actually worked; normal hours of work; and hours paid for (including both 
      normal hours and overtime hours).


      <h>USUAL HOURS OF WORK

      <p>4.14 Usual hours of work refers to a typical period rather than to a 
      specified reference period. The concept of usual hours applies both to 
      persons at work and to persons temporarily absent from work, and is 
      defined as the hours worked during a typical week or day. Actual hours 
      worked (for a specific reference period) may differ from usual hours 
      worked due to illness, vacation, strike, overtime work, a change of job or 
      similar reasons.

      <p>4.15 Measures of usual hours of work are available from: the Labour Force 
      Survey (see Chapter 19); the Labour Force Survey supplementary survey, the 
      Underemployed Workers Survey (see Chapter 20 Section 14); and from various 
      Special Social Surveys, including the Survey of Employment Arrangements 
      and Superannuation (see Chapter 21. Measures of usual hours of work are 
      not available from ABS business surveys.


      <h>ACTUAL HOURS OF WORK

      <p>4.16 International resolutions relating to actual hours worked adopted by 
      the Tenth ICLS in 1962 refer to wage and salaried employees. There are no 
      international recommendations relating to actual hours worked for all 
      categories of employed. However the ILO, in its manual Surveys of 
      Economically Active Population, Employment, Unemployment and 
      Underemployment suggests that actual hours worked in a given job should be 
      defined to cover all types of employment in labour force surveys.

      <p>4.17 According to the international resolution, actual hours of work 
      refers to a specified reference period and includes:

        <p>hours actually worked during normal periods of work;
        <p>time spent in addition to hours worked during normal periods of work 
        (including overtime);
        <p>time spent at the place of work on activities such as the preparation of 
        the workplace, repairs and maintenance, preparation and cleaning of 
        tools, and the preparation of receipts, time sheets and reports; 
        <p>time spent at the place of work waiting or standing by; and
        <p>time corresponding to short rest periods.

      <p>Excluded are: 

        <p>hours paid for but not worked such as paid annual leave, public holidays 
        or paid sick leave;
        <p>meal breaks; and
        <p>time spent on travel to and from work.

      <p>4.18 The ILO suggests that for multiple job holders (in the case of labour 
      force surveys), actual hours worked should equal the hours worked at all 
      jobs.

      <p>4.19 ABS measures of actual hours of work are consistent with the 
      international recommendations outlined above except for time spent 
      travelling to and from work by the self-employed which is sometimes 
      included in household surveys. 

      <p>4.20 Measures of actual hours of work are available from a number of ABS 
      household surveys: the Labour Force Survey (see Chapter 19 for more detail 
      on the content and methodology of this survey); various labour-related 
      supplementary topics to the Labour Force Survey (see Chapter 20, Sections 
      1 to 16 for more detail on the content and methodology of labour-related 
      supplementary surveys); various Special Social Surveys, including the 
      Survey of Employment Arrangements and Superannuation (see Chapter 21), and 
      the Survey of Employment and Unemployment Patterns (see Chapter 22); and 
      the Census of Population and Housing (see Chapter 18). Measures of actual 
      hours of work are not available from ABS business surveys.


      <h>HOURS PAID FOR 

      <p>4.21 Measures of hours paid for are collected in both ABS household 
      surveys and ABS business surveys including: the Survey of Employee 
      Earnings and Hours (a business survey - refer to Chapter 28 for more 
      detail on survey content and methodology); and the Labour Force Survey 
      supplement, the Employee Earnings, Benefits and Trade Union Membership 
      Survey (refer to Chapter 20 Section 2 for more detail).

      <p>4.22 Hours paid for are not necessarily the same as number of hours 
      actually worked (e.g. the quantum of hours reported as 'paid' and as 
      'worked' would differ for employees on paid leave, or in situations where 
      employees work more or less hours than their paid hours). While ABS 
      household surveys collect details of the number of hours paid, ABS 
      business surveys also collect information on the following components:

        <p>ordinary time hours paid for - defined as the award, standard or agreed 
        hours of work paid for at the ordinary rate. Ordinary hours paid for 
        include: stand-by or reporting time hours which are part of standard 
        hours of work, and hours of paid annual leave, paid sick leave and long 
        service leave taken during the reference period. Ordinary time hours 
        paid for at penalty rates (e.g. for shift work) are not converted to 
        their ordinary time equivalent; and
        <p>overtime hours paid for - defined as hours paid for in excess of award, 
        standard or agreed hours of work, at both standard and penalty rates. 

      <p>4.23 Measures of average (mean) and median hours paid for and average 
      hourly earnings for various categories of employee jobs are produced in 
      various ABS business surveys. 


      <h>NORMAL HOURS OF WORK

      <p>4.24 Normal hours of work were defined in a 1962 ICLS Resolution as "hours 
      of work fixed by or in pursuance of laws and regulations, collective 
      agreements or arbitral awards. Where not fixed by or in pursuance of laws 
      or regulations, collective agreements or arbitral awards, normal hours of 
      work should be taken as meaning the number of hours per day or week in 
      excess of which any time worked is remunerated at overtime rates or forms 
      an exception to the rules or custom of the establishment relating to the 
      classes of workers concerned". In the ABS, normal hours of work are 
      defined as those set down in awards or formal agreements or standard hours 
      of work in the industry or, where these do not exist, 35 hours per week.

      <p>4.25 Measures of normal hours of work are not produced by the ABS. 
      However, the concept is used in the full-time/part-time status 
      classification in ABS business surveys.


      <h>FULL-TIME/PART-TIME STATUS

      <p>4.26 The notion of what constitutes a standard full-time working week has 
      required continual re-examination over the last 40 years with the 
      progressive decline in standard hours of work, accompanied by a 
      substantial growth in the number of persons employed under part-time 
      working arrangements.

      <p>4.27 In the absence of any internationally accepted definition of 
      part-time work, two approaches have been taken in various countries. The 
      first is objective and is based on the number of hours worked. The second 
      is more subjective and involves classifying workers as full-time or 
      part-time based on the self-assessment of the person concerned 
      irrespective of the number of hours actually worked. The former approach 
      is relatively simple to apply without requiring the respondent to know 
      details about their contractual arrangements on hours worked, but provides 
      no flexibility to accommodate variations in 'normal' hours of work in 
      different industries and occupations. The self-assessment approach does 
      accommodate such differences but is subjective, and its accuracy is 
      dependent on respondents' knowledge of whether they work full-time or 
      part-time in their activity. Both approaches are used in ABS surveys. 

      <p>4.28 The full-time/part-time status classification differs from, and 
      should not be confused with, the permanent/casual classification. While 
      the classification of full-time and part-time work is based on hours 
      worked, the permanent/casual classifications used in ABS household and 
      business surveys are not. In ABS business surveys the classification of 
      employee jobs as permanent, temporary or casual is based on entitlements 
      to paid leave and the length of employment contracts. Traditionally, ABS 
      household surveys have classified employees as permanent or casual based 
      on their entitlements to paid leave. However, more recently an additional 
      criterion, on whether an employee perceives their job to be casual, has 
      been used to classify employees as self-identified casuals. The 
      permanent/casual classifications used in ABS business and household 
      surveys are discussed later in this chapter.


      <h>ABS HOUSEHOLD SURVEYS

      <p>4.29 The approach used in the Labour Force Survey and adopted in many 
      other ABS household surveys is to define full-time and part-time status in 
      terms of hours worked. The definition used designates full-time workers as 
      persons who (a) usually work 35 hours or more per week in all jobs, or (b) 
      although usually working less than 35 hours a week, actually worked 35 
      hours or more during the reference week. Part-time workers are those who 
      usually work less than 35 hours per week, and either did so during the 
      reference week, or were not at work in the reference week. Under this 
      definition, persons with more than one job are defined as full-time if 
      they work more than 35 hours across all of their jobs.

      <p>4.30 A subjective approach based on respondents' perception of their 
      full-time or part-time status is used in some supplementary topics to the 
      Labour Force Survey, and in some Special Social Surveys. This approach is 
      most often used where information is sought about work that is not 
      currently being undertaken and where recall problems may be encountered 
      using a more objective approach (e.g. for jobs held 12 months prior to the 
      survey date). It is also sometimes used to determine the full-time or 
      part-time status of each job held by multiple job holders. 

      <p>4.31 Full-time/part-time status is available from a number of ABS 
      household surveys including: the monthly Labour Force Survey (see Chapter 
      19 for more detail on the content and methodology of this survey); various 
      labour-related supplementary topics to the monthly Labour Force Survey 
      (see Chapter 20 Sections 1 to 16 for more detail on the content and 
      methodology of labour-related supplementary surveys); various Special 
      Social Surveys including the Survey of Employment Arrangements and 
      Superannuation (see Chapter 21), and the Survey of Employment and 
      Unemployment Patterns (see Chapter 22); and the Census of Population and 
      Housing (see Chapter 18).

      <p>4.32 Persons working part-time hours should not be confused with 
      underemployed workers (discussed in Chapter 5) even though both may be 
      working less than 35 hours per week. Part-time workers can be classified 
      into two groups: fully employed part-time workers who work part-time 
      voluntarily, and underemployed part-time workers who work part-time on an 
      involuntary basis (i.e. they want more hours of work) and who may be 
      seeking and/or available for more work.


      <h>ABS BUSINESS SURVEYS

      <p>4.33 In ABS business surveys, the classification of employee jobs as 
      full-time is based on whether the usual hours worked are equal to, or 
      greater than, what has been agreed to as being full-time under the 
      relevant award or agreement (i.e. normal hours). If there are no agreed or 
      award hours associated with the job, then it is classified as full-time 
      where the usual hours of work per week are 35 or more. Part-time jobs are 
      those not defined as full-time.

      <p>4.34 The full-time/part-time status classification is used in the 
      following ABS business surveys: the Survey of Employment and Earnings (see 
      Chapter 29); the Survey of Employee Earnings and Hours (see Chapter 28); 
      and the Survey of Average Weekly Earnings (see Chapter 27).


      <h>PERMANENT/CASUAL STATUS 

      <p>4.35 Traditionally, ABS household surveys have classified persons in paid 
      employment (employees) as permanent or casual according to their paid 
      leave entitlements. However, more recently an additional criterion, on 
      whether an employee perceives their job to be casual, has been used to 
      classify employees as self-identified casual. The classification used in 
      ABS business surveys is different, classifying employee jobs as either 
      permanent, temporary or casual. The classifications used in household and 
      business surveys are discussed further below.

      <p>4.36 The permanent/casual status classification differs from, and should 
      not be confused with, the full-time/part-time classification which is a 
      classification of hours worked. The full-time/part-time classification was 
      discussed earlier in this chapter.


      <h>ABS HOUSEHOLD SURVEYS

      <p>4.37 Entitlement to paid holiday leave and paid sick leave has been used 
      in ABS household surveys to distinguish between permanent and casual 
      employees. Employees who were entitled to either paid holiday or paid sick 
      leave (or both) in their main job have been classified as permanent, while 
      employees who were entitled to neither have been classified as casual. 
      This method of identifying permanent and casual employees was simple and 
      objective, and reflected long established definitions of permanent and 
      casual employees used in Australia's industrial relations systems where, 
      under the awards system, casuals were paid loadings in lieu of 
      entitlements to paid holiday leave and paid sick leave. Changes to the 
      leave entitlements of casuals from the late 1990s, where casuals are 
      increasingly entitled to various forms of paid leave, have meant that the 
      classification of permanent and casual employees based solely on paid 
      leave entitlements is no longer appropriate. From late 2000, the terms 
      'permanent' and 'casual' will no longer be used in ABS household surveys 
      to describe employees with and without leave entitlements. The term 
      'permanent' will be replaced with the term 'with leave entitlements', and 
      'casual' will be replaced with the term 'without leave entitlements'. 

      <p>4.38 In addition to information on leave entitlements, a small number of 
      ABS household surveys also collect information from employees on whether 
      they perceive themselves to be casual. Only those employees who are not 
      entitled to both paid holiday leave and paid sick leave are asked about 
      their casual status in these surveys. Information about leave entitlements 
      is then used together with information on respondents' perception of their 
      casual status to classify employees (excluding owner managers of 
      incorporated enterprises) into three groups.

        <p>Employees with any leave entitlements - comprising: employees who are 
        entitled to both paid holiday leave and paid sick leave; and employees 
        who are entitled to either paid holiday leave or paid sick leave and who 
        do not consider their jobs to be casual.
        <p>Self-identified casuals - comprising: employees who are entitled to 
        either paid holiday leave or paid sick leave but not both, or who have 
        no leave entitlements, and who consider their jobs to be casual.
        <p>Employees without leave entitlements who do not consider their jobs to 
        be casual. 

      <p>4.39 The relationship between the two classifications used in household 
      surveys is illustrated in diagram 4.2.


      <h>4.2 CLASSIFICATIONS OF PERMANENT AND CASUAL STATUS USED IN ABS HOUSEHOLD 
      SURVEYS






      <p>4.40 ABS household surveys for which the 'with leave 
      entitlements'/'without leave entitlements' classification (previously 
      known as permanent/casual classification) is available include a number of 
      supplements to the Labour Force Survey: the Employee Earnings, Benefits 
      and Trade Union Membership Survey (Chapter 20 Section 2); the Working 
      Arrangements Survey (Chapter 20 Section 16); and the Work Related Injuries 
      Survey (Chapter 20 Section 15). Household surveys which also use 
      information on employees' self-perception of their casual status include: 
      the Labour Force Survey supplement, the Forms of Employment Survey1 
      (Chapter 20 Section 3); and the Special Social Survey, the Survey of 
      Employment Arrangements and Superannuation (Chapter 21). 
      <p>1. The classification used in the 1998 Forms of Employment Survey differs 
      slightly from the classification presented. Employees who were entitled to 
      either paid holiday or sick leave (but not both) and who did not consider 
      their job to be casual were classified as 'other employed persons'. Also 
      classified as 'other employed persons' were: employees who were entitled 
      to neither paid holiday leave nor paid sick leave and who did not consider 
      their job to be casual; and owner managers of unincorporated enterprises 
      who did not invoice or bill for own payment and paid Pay As You Earn tax.


      <h>ABS BUSINESS SURVEYS

      <p>4.41 The permanent/temporary/casual classification is available from the 
      Survey of Employee Earnings and Hours (Chapter 28). In the survey, 
      employee jobs are classified according to respondents' perception of the 
      permanent, temporary or casual nature of the job. To assist respondents to 
      classify jobs, some information is provided on the survey questionnaire 
      about each type of job. Permanent jobs are described as jobs with paid 
      annual and sick leave entitlements. Temporary jobs are described as jobs 
      with some leave entitlements but with a short-term employment contract. 
      Casual jobs are described as jobs with higher rates of pay, to compensate 
      for lack of permanency and leave entitlements.


      <h>ADULT/JUNIOR STATUS

      <p>4.42 The adult/junior classification is only available from ABS 
      labour-related business surveys. In these surveys, adults are defined as 
      employees aged 21 years or over, and employees who are paid at the adult 
      rate regardless of their age (e.g. employees aged under 21 years may be 
      paid at the full adult rate for their occupation). Juniors are employees 
      aged under 21 years who are not paid at the adult rate of pay for their 
      occupation. ABS labour-related business surveys for which the adult/junior 
      classification is available include the Survey of Employee Earnings and 
      Hours (Chapter 28). The Survey of Average Weekly Earnings (Chapter 27) 
      also produces estimates relating to full-time adult jobs.

      <p>4.43 Adult/junior status is not determined in household surveys; however, 
      details of age are collected.


      <h>MANAGERIAL/NON-MANAGERIAL STATUS

      <p>4.44 The managerial/non-managerial classification is only available from 
      ABS business surveys. Managerial jobs are defined as those involving 
      responsibility for a significant number of employees, or having 
      significant responsibilities in the conduct or operations of an 
      enterprise/organisation. They do not usually have overtime payment 
      entitlements. Jobs occupied by professionally qualified persons are 
      defined as managerial only if the occupant primarily performs managerial 
      tasks. Jobs occupied by working proprietors of incorporated businesses are 
      considered managerial. Non-managerial occupations include supervisors, 
      clerical staff, tradespersons, non-managerial professionals, apprentices, 
      trainees and cadets. Business surveys for which the 
      managerial/non-managerial classification is available include the Survey 
      of Employee Earnings and Hours (Chapter 28).


      <h>EMPLOYMENT TYPE

      <p>4.45 The number and types of employment groups identified in the status in 
      employment classification (paragraphs 4.2-4.6) are extended in two 
      household surveys which examine working relationships in detail: the Forms 
      of Employment Survey (a supplement to the Labour Force Survey); and the 
      Survey of Employment Arrangements and Superannuation. Both surveys examine 
      the nature of employment arrangements of persons whose status in 
      employment is an employee2, employer or own account worker; and then 
      reclassify these persons into alternative paid employment and 
      self-employment groups. 
      2. Excluding employees who are paid only in kind.


      <h>FORMS OF EMPLOYMENT SURVEY

      <p>4.46 The 1998 Forms of Employment Survey (a supplement to the Labour Force 
      Survey) identified five employment types: employees with leave 
      entitlements; self identified casuals; other employed; owner managers of 
      incorporated enterprises; and owner managers of unincorporated 
      enterprises. These groups are described in more detail below.

        <p>Employees with leave entitlements - persons who were entitled to receive 
        both paid holiday leave and paid sick leave, and who either:
            <p>worked in someone else's business; or

            <p>reported that they worked in their own unincorporated business but 
            did not invoice clients for own payment and paid Pay As You Earn 
            (PAYE) tax.
        <p>Self identified casuals - persons who were not entitled to receive both 
        paid holiday leave and paid sick leave, and considered their job to be 
        casual, and who either:
            <p>worked in someone else's business; or

            <p>reported that they worked in their own unincorporated business but 
            did not invoice clients for own payment and paid PAYE tax.
        <p>Other employed persons - persons who were not entitled to receive both 
        paid holiday leave and paid sick leave, and did not consider their job 
        to be casual, and who either:
            <p>worked in someone else's business; or

            <p>reported that they worked in their own unincorporated business but 
            did not invoice clients for own payment and paid PAYE tax.
        <p>Owner managers of incorporated enterprises - persons who work in their 
        own incorporated enterprise. This group includes persons who draw a wage 
        or salary for their work in their own incorporated enterprise.
        <p>Owner managers of unincorporated enterprises - persons who operate their 
        own unincorporated enterprise, including those engaged independently in 
        a trade or profession.

      <p>4.47 The classification used in the 1998 Forms of Employment Survey is 
      illustrated below. Note that the classification used in the 1998 survey 
      was experimental, and will be revised for repeats of the survey in 2001 
      and beyond. The revised classification will be based on the employment 
      type classification used in the Survey of Employment Arrangements and 
      Superannuation, which is described below. A comparison of the employment 
      type classifications used in the 1998 Forms of Employment Survey and the 
      Survey of Employment Arrangements and Superannuation is also provided 
      below.


      <p>4.3 EMPLOYMENT TYPE CLASSIFICATION - FORMS OF EMPLOYMENT SURVEY, 1998







      <h>SURVEY OF EMPLOYMENT ARRANGEMENTS AND SUPERANNUATION

      <p>4.48 The Survey of Employment Arrangements and Superannuation also 
      identifies five employment types: employees with any leave entitlements; 
      self identified casuals; employees without leave entitlements; owner 
      managers of incorporated enterprises; and owner managers of unincorporated 
      enterprises. Three of these groups are then further classified as follows: 
      employees with any leave entitlements as either holding a fixed-term 
      employment contract or not; and both owner managers of incorporated 
      enterprises and owner managers of unincorporated enterprises as either 
      working on a contract basis or not. These groups are described in more 
      detail below:

        <p>Employees with some leave entitlements - persons who worked in someone 
        else's business, and were:
            entitled to both paid holiday leave and sick leave; or

            entitled to either paid holiday leave or sick leave, and did not 
            consider their job to be casual.
        <p>Employees with any leave entitlements are further classified as either 
        working on a fixed-term contract or not.
        <p>Self-identified casuals - persons who worked in someone else's business, 
        and were:
            <p>entitled to either paid holiday leave or sick leave (but not both), 
            and considered their job to be casual; or

            <p>entitled to neither paid holiday leave nor sick leave, and 
            considered their job to be casual.
        <p>Employees without leave entitlements who did not identify as casual - 
        persons who worked in someone else's business, and were entitled to 
        neither paid holiday leave nor sick leave, and did not consider their 
        job to be casual.
        <p>Owner managers of incorporated enterprises - persons who work in their 
        own incorporated enterprise. This includes persons who draw a wage or 
        salary for their work in their own incorporated enterprise. This group 
        is further classified as working on a contract basis or not.
        <p>Owner managers of unincorporated enterprises - persons who operate their 
        own unincorporated enterprise, including those engaged independently in 
        a trade or profession. This group is also further classified as working 
        on a contract basis or not.

      <p>4.49 The classification used in the Survey of Employment Arrangements and 
      Superannuation is illustrated in diagram 4.4.


      <h>4.4 EMPLOYMENT TYPE CLASSIFICATION - SURVEY OF EMPLOYMENT ARRANGEMENTS AND 
      SUPERANNUATION 








      <h>COMPARISON OF EMPLOYMENT TYPE CLASSIFICATIONS: THE 1998 FORMS OF 
      EMPLOYMENT SURVEY AND THE SURVEY OF EMPLOYMENT ARRANGEMENTS AND 
      SUPERANNUATION

      <p>4.50 There are some important differences in the way in which people are 
      classified to employment type categories in the 1998 Forms of Employment 
      Survey and the Survey of Employment Arrangements and Superannuation. These 
      differences are outlined below.

        <p>Entitled to either paid sick leave or paid holiday leave, but not both, 
        and did not identify as casual - in the Forms of Employment Survey, this 
        group formed part of the 'other employed persons' category. In the 
        Survey of Employment Arrangements and Superannuation, this group was 
        treated as 'employees with any leave entitlements', i.e. in the same way 
        as those who were entitled to both forms of paid leave.
        Working in own unincorporated enterprise, and did not invoice or bill 
        for own payment, and reported paying PAYE tax - in the Forms of 
        Employment Survey, this group was treated in a similar manner to 
        employees excluding owner managers of incorporated enterprises. These 
        workers were classified to different employment type categories 
        according to their entitlements to paid leave and whether they 
        considered their jobs to be casual. Thus these workers may be classified 
        as 'employees with leave entitlements', 'self-identified casuals' or 
        'other employed persons'. In the Survey of Employment Arrangements and 
        Superannuation, these workers were retained in the category 'owner 
        managers of unincorporated enterprises'. 
        <p>No paid leave entitlements but did not identify as casual - people 
        without any paid leave entitlements who did not identify as casual were 
        classified as 'other employed persons' in the Forms of Employment 
        Survey, but were separated into a group of their own in the Survey of 
        Employment Arrangements and Superannuation.

      <p>4.51 All those making up the 'other employed persons' category in the 
      Forms of Employment Survey were allocated to different categories in the 
      Survey of Employment Arrangements and Superannuation, and so the category 
      'other employed persons' is not used in the latter survey.

      <p>4.52 Apart from these differences, there is an extra level of detail in 
      the employment type categories of the Survey of Employment Arrangements 
      and Superannuation: employees with some leave entitlements are subdivided 
      into those working on a fixed-term contract and those not working on a 
      fixed-term contract; and owner managers of incorporated and unincorporated 
      enterprises are subdivided according to whether they are working on a 
      contract basis.


      <h>OTHER EMPLOYMENT MEASURES


      <h>WORKING ARRANGEMENTS

      <p>4.53 Measures of working arrangements supplement measures of hours of 
      work, full-time and part-time status, and other classifications of 
      jobholders (such as status in employment, permanent/casual status etc.) 
      and are useful in understanding changing workplace employment conditions. 
      Detailed information about working arrangements is collected in a number 
      of ABS surveys: the supplements to the Labour Force Survey, namely the 
      Working Arrangements Survey, the Forms of Employment Survey, the Locations 
      of Work Survey, and the Employee Earnings, Benefits and Trade Union 
      Membership Survey; and the Special Social Survey, namely the Survey of 
      Employment Arrangements and Superannuation.

      <h>Working Arrangements Survey

      <p>4.54 The Working Arrangements Survey (a supplement to the Labour Force 
      Survey), collects information about: patterns of hours worked, including 
      flexibility of start and finish times and ability to work extra hours in 
      order to take time off; entitlement to rostered days off including whether 
      there is choice in when a rostered day is to be taken off; overtime 
      including regularity of overtime, whether usually works the same number of 
      hours each week, number of overtime hours usually worked, methods of 
      payment and main reason usually works overtime; shift work; part-time work 
      including reasons for working part-time; job sharing; child-care 
      arrangements; and recent absences from work including reason for absence, 
      length of absence and type of leave taken. For further information on the 
      content and methodology of the Working Arrangements Survey refer to 
      Chapter 20 Section 16.

      <h>Forms of Employment Survey

      <p>4.55 The Forms of Employment Survey (a supplement to the Labour Force 
      Survey), collects detailed information on a range of aspects of employment 
      arrangements including: the temporary nature of work; whether paid by an 
      employment agency; and whether owner managers pay PAYE tax (or equivalent) 
      or draw a wage or salary. The survey classified jobholders according to 
      their working relationship/type of work undertaken (see discussion above) 
      and collected detailed information about the characteristics of each group 
      including: occupation, and industry in which they were employed; 
      continuous duration in current job and expected future duration in current 
      job; whether earnings vary; hours worked and paid for; and preferences to 
      change hours. Additional information was collected for various 
      classifications of work relationships/types of work:

        <p>for employees with leave entitlements - details of leave entitlements 
        (paid holiday leave, paid sick leave and long service leave), 
        superannuation coverage, details of the temporary nature of job (whether 
        has a set employment completion date, whether employed on a fixed term 
        contract, and whether expects contract to be renewed) and whether paid 
        by an employment agency;
        <p>for self-identified casuals - as above plus whether looked for 
        alternative employment in the last three months, and whether looked for 
        permanent employment;
        <p>for other employed persons - details of leave entitlements, 
        superannuation coverage, details of contract work undertaken (whether 
        has more than one contract, whether can subcontract, whether can work 
        for multiple clients under contract, whether has control over working 
        procedures), details of the temporary nature of job, whether paid by an 
        employment agency, and whether receives a payslip;
        <p>owner managers of incorporated enterprises - whether has employees, 
        details of leave entitlements, superannuation coverage, details of 
        contract work undertaken, and whether draws a wage or salary from 
        current business; and
        <p>owner managers of unincorporated enterprises - whether has employees, 
        whether invoices for own payment, details of contract work undertaken, 
        and whether draws a wage or salary from current business.

      <p>4.56 For further information on the content and methodology of the Forms 
      of Employment Survey refer to Chapter 20 Section 3.

      <h>Survey of Employment Arrangements and Superannuation

      <p>4.57 As discussed previously, the Survey of Employment Arrangements and 
      Superannuation also classifies jobholders according to their employment 
      relationships/type of work undertaken and collects detailed information 
      about jobholders' employment or working arrangements. Included in the 
      survey are details of: superannuation; casual employment (based on leave 
      entitlements and self-identification); occupation, industry and sector; 
      the number and regularity of hours worked, additional hours/overtime, on 
      call/stand-by, evening and weekend work, time in job/business and shift 
      work; contract work; leave entitlements; occupational health and safety; 
      home-based work; preferred working patterns; job duration and expected job 
      duration; educational attainment; apprenticeships/traineeships; multiple 
      jobholders; and trade union membership. For further information on the 
      content and methodology of the Survey of Employment Arrangements and 
      Superannuation refer to Chapter 21.

      <h>Locations of Work Survey

      <p>4.58 The Locations of Work Survey (a supplement to the Labour Force 
      Survey), collects information on: where people work, such as their own 
      home or employer's premises; and the working arrangements of persons who 
      are working at home such as use of computers, time in job at home and 
      information on how workers are paid. For further information on the 
      content and methodology of the Locations of Work Survey refer to Chapter 
      20 Section 8.

      <h>Employee Earnings, Benefits and Trade Union Membership Survey

      <p>4.59 The Employee Earnings, Benefits and Trade Union Membership Survey (a 
      supplement to the Labour Force Survey), collects information on: employee 
      earnings; trade union membership; and employee benefits. Information 
      collected on employee benefits includes: entitlement to paid holiday 
      leave, paid sick leave and paid long service leave; and superannuation 
      coverage. More detailed information on the receipt of a range of other 
      employee benefits (including transport, telephone, holiday expenses, 
      medical, low interest finance, housing, goods and services) is collected 
      on a three yearly basis. For further information on the content and 
      methodology of the Employee Earnings, Benefits and Trade Union Membership 
      Survey refer to Chapter 20 Section 2.
