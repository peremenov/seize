                    <p>"George Lucas is a master storyteller, but he is first and 
                    foremost a moving image pioneer. He has advanced the art of 
                    the moving image like few others, and in the process has 
                    inspired a new generation of filmmakers around the world. 
                    AFI is proud to present him with its Life Achievement 
                    Award."

                     <p>"I've been very fortunate to have had a long career doing 
                    what I love to do, and being recognized by AFI for it is 
                    really an honor. I'm proud to be counted among such an 
                    extraordinary group of people whose lives are dedicated to 
                    the art of making movies."

                  <h>About the AFI Life Achievement Award
                   <p>The highest honor given for a career in film, the AFI Life 
                  Achievement Award was established by the AFI Board of Trustees 
                  on February 26, 1973. It is presented to a single honoree each 
                  year based on the following criteria as mandated through a 
                  resolution passed by the AFI Board of Trustees: 
                   <p>"The recipient should be one whose talent has in a fundamental 
                  way advanced the film art; whose accomplishment has been 
                  acknowledged by scholars, critics, professional peers and the 
                  general public; and whose work has stood the test of time." 
                   <p>In 1993, the trustees extended the criteria to encompass 
                  "individuals with active careers and work of significance yet 
                  to be accomplished." 

                  <h>About George Lucas
                   <p>Born and reared in Modesto, California, George Lucas first 
                  attracted attention for his filmmaking abilities as a student 
                  at the University of Southern California, when his short film, 
                  ELECTRONIC LABYRINTH THX 1138 4EB, won the top award at the 
                  National Student Film Festival.
                   <p>In 1971, using San Francisco production studio American 
                  Zoetrope and long-time friend Francis Ford Coppola as 
                  executive producer, Lucas transformed the short film into his 
                  first feature, the stunningly prescient THX 1138.
                   <p>His follow-up, the low-budget AMERICAN GRAFFITI (1973), became 
                  the most successful film of its time. But it was STAR WARS 
                  (1977), Lucas' third film, which changed everything. A 
                  deceptively simple morality tale of good versus evil told 
                  across a fantastic landscape of exotic planets and bizarre 
                  creatures, STAR WARS became an international phenomenon. 
                  Refusing to accept the limitations of filmmaking at the time, 
                  Lucas created his own visual effects company, Industrial Light 
                  & Magic, to make his vision a reality.
                   <p>Lucas has been storywriter and executive producer of a series 
                  of box-office hits beginning in the 1980s, starting with the 
                  continuation of the STAR WARS saga, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK in 
                  1980 and RETURN OF THE JEDI in 1983. In 1981, he created the 
                  classic adventurer INDIANA JONES, star of three classic 
                  box-office hits as well as a television series, THE YOUNG 
                  INDIANA JONES CHRONICLES, which won 12 Emmy Awards.
                   <p>Throughout the 1980s, Lucas helped bring to the screen an 
                  array of films as diverse as WILLOW, TUCKER: THE MAN AND HIS 
                  DREAM and MISHIMA, and helped create unforgettable Disney 
                  theme park attractions. As chairman of Lucasfilm Ltd., Lucas 
                  oversaw its growth into all facets of filmmaking and 
                  entertainment. ILM has delivered revolutionary visual effects 
                  for scores of films and blazed new trails into the world of 
                  digital imagery. The computer graphic research division of 
                  Lucasfilm was spun-off in 1986 and became Pixar Animation 
                  Studios. 
                   <p>Skywalker Sound has applied its own perfection and devotion to 
                  the crafting of a film's soundtrack and post-production 
                  editing. Lucasfilm has been a post-production innovator, with 
                  such pioneering achievements as non-linear video editing 
                  systems that became the basis of the standard editing 
                  platforms used in film and television today. 
                   <p>Lucasfilm also includes LucasArts, a leading developer of home 
                  computer and console-based entertainment, and Lucas Licensing, 
                  which has expanded the STAR WARS and INDIANA JONES brands into 
                  best-selling novels, toys and merchandise. 
                   <p>Lucas returned to directing in 1999 with STAR WARS: EPISODE I 
                  THE PHANTOM MENACE. Three years later, STAR WARS: EPISODE II 
                  ATTACK OF THE CLONES was the first major live-action movie to 
                  be shot entirely digitally. Lucas is currently in 
                  post-production on the third and final STAR WARS film, EPISODE 
                  III REVENGE OF THE SITH, scheduled to be released May 19, 
                  2005.
