            <p>"I like him, 
            but does he know how to manage his money? And will I get stuck 
            holding the bag?" Our advice team gives the word.

             


      <h>Dear Rosie & Sherry,
      <p>I am dating someone I really like, and I think he'll make a wonderful 
      husband and father. He has great qualities that I admire and respect, 
      strong morals and ethics, and is kind, giving and sensitive to my needs. 
      I'm also very attracted to him. We enjoy many of the same things together.
      <p>He feels pretty much the same way about me, and he wants to get married.
      <p>One major issue is holding me back, however. He owes $80,000 in school 
      loans. I'm sure that many professionals have similarly large student 
      debts, but I wonder how this impacts a marriage. How secure should a 
      person's financial situation be before leaping into marriage -- or should 
      you just have faith that everything will work out? He's not working for a 
      major firm, but is trying to make it own his own. I believe in him and 
      think he can do it, but I worry about money nonetheless. I'm trying to be 
      sensible, but I don't want a great guy to slip by.

      <h>Dear Alice:
      <p>Money is a big issue in every marriage and each couple must address a 
      variety financial before they get to the chuppah.
      <p>What about student loans specifically? They are a fact of life for 
      thousands of young adults, and if they are being repaid according to a 
      plan, there is no reason why a couple with student loans cannot get 
      married.
      <p>The two of you should look at the loans as an investment that will be 
      repaid over a relatively short period of time, but will reap benefits for 
      decades to come. Then, reach an understanding how these loans will be 
      repaid, amongst the repayment options being offered. If you are ready to 
      become engaged and he has not yet chosen an option, do it together, since 
      it will affect you both. Then, make sure that you follow that choice, and 
      don't look back at your original decision.
      <p>True, the loan repayments will affect your lifestyle, but without the loan 
      he probably would earn much less to begin with. The obligation will be 
      repaid after a relatively short period of time, and you can use the way 
      you deal will this issue as a model for dealing with other major expenses 
      and obligations you'll encounter during marriage -- e.g. mortgages, kids' 
      educations.
      <p>Everything you say about the man you are dating leads us to believe that 
      the two of you have all the ingredients for a happy and enduring marriage. 
      However, if you had told us that he had $80,000 in consumer debt, our 
      answer would be very different. In such a case, you would face two 
      challenges: a payment schedule involving double-digit interest charges, 
      and a spouse who probably cannot manage money. Your intended would have to 
      acknowledge this difficulty and would have to learn how to live within his 
      means, which might require help from a financial counselor. The two of you 
      would then have to establish a financial plan for your marriage that would 
      enable him to pay off the debt, control spending, and learn to save.
      <p>One word of legal advice. Generally speaking, pre-marital debts don't 
      become joint legal obligations once a couple gets married, even though 
      their combined incomes are used for payments. Pre-marital debt can turn 
      into a joint obligation, though, if at some time in the future the couple 
      pays it off with the proceeds of a new loan taken out in both of their 
      names. If you are marrying someone with any significant pre-marital debt, 
      both of you should sign a prenuptial agreement that will protect the 
      debt-free spouse from having to pay the other's pre-marriage debts in the 
      event of death or divorce.

      <h>Dear Rosie & Sherry:
      <p>In an earlier column, you advised a reader to bring up the subject of 
      marriage and commitment on her own, since her boyfriend never discussed 
      it. I'm in a similar situation and I'd like to know how to initiate such a 
      conversation and get it going. How do you discuss the subject? What do you 
      say?
      <p>Meredith


      <h>Dear Meredith:
      <p>As a general rule, we advise marriage-oriented men and women to only date 
      people who are also dating for marriage. Practically speaking, it's 
      awkward to raise this subject when you first meet or start to date. 
      However, telling your goal to everyone who helps set you up will encourage 
      them introduce you to people you are on a similar track.
      <p>You can open the subject less directly by explaining the reason why you 
      are dating: You hope to find the man you will marry. This approach lets 
      you explain your goal, but doesn't put him in the uncomfortable position 
      of being identified as the object of your intentions -- before you know if 
      he shares your goals.
      <p>If he admits that he won't be ready for marriage in the near future, run 
      to the nearest exit and spend some time nursing your wounded heart. Do the 
      same if he tells you he'd like to get married someday, but doesn't see 
      that happening for 3-to-5 years. Cut your losses now. Trust us -- you'll 
      save yourself a bigger heartbreak in the future and a wasted investment of 
      your time and emotions.
      <p>On the other hand, if he says that he's also dating for marriage or that 
      he hopes to get married within the next year or so, the two of you can 
      discuss the possibilities of a future together. Mention the qualities he 
      has that you admire and respect, and talk about other positive aspects of 
      your relationship. And wonder if he shares many of these feelings. If he 
      does, you can handle the rest of the discussion on your own...
