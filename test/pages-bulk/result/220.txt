      <p>The deadline to place a measure on the fall ballot has come and gone, but 
      a San Mateo County Superior Court judge said he may issue a court order 
      requiring the county to ignore the deadline and allow Coastside voters to 
      decide a contentious annexation issue on November 2. 
      <p>Judge Carl W. Holm said on August 6 that he was duty-bound to personally 
      review rejected petitions protesting the planned annexation of some 220 
      square miles of the San Mateo County coast to the Midpeninsula Regional 
      Open Space District. But, he added, pointing to a box of rejected protests 
      perched next to him in his courtroom, "these are in a mess." 
      <p>He then ordered the county elections office to organize them so he can 
      conduct his review prior to a new court hearing, to be conducted no later 
      than August 20. 
      <p>The annexation was set to go forward last month after the elections office 
      determined that opponents had not turned in the required number of protest 
      petitions to place the matter on the ballot. With 4,071 protests required 
      -- a figure representing 25 percent of registered voters living in the 
      annexation area -- annexation opponents submitted 5,340 protests. But 
      elections officials determined that 1,757 were invalid, meaning opponents 
      missed the mark by 628 protests. 
      <p>After that ruling, Coastside resident Oscar Braun and the Half Moon Bay 
      Coastside Foundation filed a lawsuit, and obtained a temporary restraining 
      order to prevent the annexation from occurring. 
      <p>After four days of legal wrangling in Superior Court and a court-ordered 
      recount of the rejected protests, both parties expected a decision last 
      Friday -- the last day to file a ballot measure for the November election. 
      But Judge Holm instead ordered both parties back in court after everyone 
      has had a chance to review the invalidated protests. 
      <p>Those protests had been rejected for a number of reasons. About 540 were 
      found to be duplicate protests, meaning some petitioners signed more than 
      one protest -- in some cases, five, according to the elections office. 
      Under questioning during one court hearing in July, even protest leader 
      Terry Gossett revealed that he had signed duplicate protests, as did his 
      wife. 
      <p>The county also rejected 376 protests that had been altered after they 
      were signed; about 170 from people living outside the annexation area; and 
      about 340 from people not registered to vote. 
      <p>The plaintiffs focused mainly on the 376 altered protests in trying to 
      convince the judge that the county unfairly threw out protests to deny 
      opponents a chance to put the question to voters. Those protests, the 
      plaintiffs argued, had been altered by a petition collector only to 
      clarify the information on the protest -- for example, the addition of a 
      street address to a post office box. 
      <p>But attorneys for the open space district noted that even if all the 
      altered protests were validated, the total would still fall short of the 
      required 25 percent threshold. 
      <p>Judge Holm emphasized that his postponement of a decision didn't mean he 
      would order an election. Saying he believed that the law required him to 
      review the rejected protests, he added, "I'm not saying I would disagree 
      with (the elections office's) conclusion." 
      <p>Should he disagree, however, he could order the elections office to put 
      the question on the November ballot. Linda Tulett of the elections office 
      said that the office could protest such an order, but is unlikely to. An 
      exception might be if the order came after ballots were printed, she said. 

      <p>The public open space district has worked for about seven years to annex 
      the Coastside from the southern boundary of Pacifica to the Santa Cruz 
      County border. The annexation would allow the district to buy and manage 
      the land for open space, agriculture and limited recreation.
