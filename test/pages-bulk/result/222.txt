       <h>STARS IN YOUR EYES!
      Astrological Forecasts for Uncommon Womyn and Others
      By CHAD HENRY, AFA, NCGR 
      <h>MARCH ASTROLOGICAL FORECAST

      <h>DO YOU KNOW YOUR MOON SIGN?
      <p>Most of us know our Sun signsâ€"Libra, Aries, Sagittarius, Pisces, and so 
      on through the zodiac. But how many of us know what sign the Moon was in 
      at the moment of our birth? Though people of all sexes have an 
      astrological Moon, women have a special affinity for this mysterious lady 
      of the nightâ€"no matter where you stand in the butch-femme line-up. Luna 
      rules women, moms, the public, the tides, the menstrual cycle, the moods 
      and emotions. She is intuitive and psychic. She symbolizes the great 
      Goddess in all her phases, from maiden to warrior to mother to crone. 
      Planting by Moon sign improves garden production, and planning by Moon 
      sign can improve every phase of your life. The Moon rules home, family, 
      motherhood, and childbirth. Whereas the planet Mercury rules the 
      analytical, intellectual brain, the Moon rules the entire mind, which 
      receives knowledge and wisdom directly from the universe, the 
      subconscious, and the collective unconscious. She also rules habits and 
      unconscious knowledgeâ€"like knowing how to tie your shoes, drive a car, 
      cruise a cutie without getting busted. 
      <p>The Moon gives form to your Sun sign, the way a mother gives form to the 
      spark that becomes her child. You may have a rambunctious Aries Sun, but 
      with a Libra Moon, youâ€™ll warm up that drive and assertiveness with 
      diplomacy, tact, consideration and uncertainty. With a Leo Moon, youâ€™re 
      Xena II! There are 144 Sun-Moon combinationsâ€"whatâ€™s yours? Your Lunar 
      Phase at birth will tell an astrologer a lot about your mission in life, 
      and the lunar nodesâ€"a lot more, even, according to Indian astrologers, 
      your true life path. 
      <p>Although women as a rule seem much more in touch with lunar energy than 
      men do, still, Western Civilization keeps trying to steer us away from the 
      irrational, illogical, deep and ancient wisdom of lunar energy, and toward 
      rationality, logic, "common sense", clock time, schedules, facts and 
      figures. In fact, Don Miguel Ruiz, author of the highly recommended "The 
      Four Agreements", calls modern urban humans "domesticated". Which means 
      tamed, intimidated, dumbed down, uptight, cut off from our instinctual, 
      lunar selves. To be truly joyful and connected, we need the freedom to 
      honor our instinctive, lunar identity, which in fact is a big part of our 
      overall personality! Learning your Moon sign, natal Lunar Phase, and sign 
      and house placement of your lunar nodes, is a first step toward better 
      self-understanding. 
      <p>For those who follow the paths of Wicca, Tibetan Buddhism, and so many 
      other spiritual practices, following the phases of the Moon, and 
      celebrating the New and Full Moons every month, are an important part of 
      worship. Honoring the new and full moons monthly, even with a single white 
      candle, can help to reconnect you when youâ€™re feeling lonely, cut off, 
      depressed, flat and dull, or trapped in a boring job, a frustrating 
      relationship, an environment that doesnâ€™t bring you happiness. If you 
      donâ€™t have one, find a picture that you love of any one of the great 
      Goddesses of any world religion, from Virgin Mary to Kali to Kwan Yinâ€"or 
      even mix and match!â€"make a tiny little shrine to the Goddess on your 
      bookshelf or window sill, and start watching the moon phasesâ€"with a 
      calendar, the newspaper, or one of the many online resources that track 
      the phases, such as Lunabar.com. Light that candle twice a month on the 
      new and full moons, light some great incense, ring a bell, give her a 
      brownie or a glass of vodka, and ask Her for guidance, wisdom, love, 
      health, and luck. Connect with her during your period, too. Chanting, 
      drumming, dancing, singing, playing music, making freeform artwork, 
      playing games, meditating, casting spells, working with Tarot, I Ching or 
      runes or other non-linear spirit work can help forge a link back to your 
      lunar self, and back to wholeness and happiness. 
      <p>The New Moon in March is the 14thâ€"the Full Moon is on the 28th. The New 
      Moon is a great time to start a new project. The Full Moon is a time to 
      reap, and a time to wrap up loose ends. 
       
      <p>Since March brings the spring equinox and the Sun moves into the Cardinal 
      sign of Aries, Iâ€™ll give you a quick thumbprint of Moon in Aries: 
      Restless, impatient, quick, fiery, assertive, a natural leaderâ€"Aries 
      Moon likes to be numero uno. Even women with Aries Moon are male 
      chauvinists! Theyâ€™ve always got one eye on the future and hate to wait 
      in line, and slowpokes drive them nuts. They want to be independent, free 
      to come and go at will, and they want to do things their own way. They 
      like speed and efficiency. Their leadership style is "you can follow me or 
      not-but Iâ€™m gonna be out there in front!" A lot of folks with Aries Moon 
      will tell you they had horrible fights at home, especially with dad. They 
      tend to drive too fast, even though their skills and coordination are 
      usually excellent. A partner with Aries Moon needs a long leash. Unless 
      the Moon is cooled off by a tough aspect from planets such as Saturn or 
      Neptune, you need action, speed, and lots of good lovinâ€™. 
      <h>ARIES 
      <p>Youâ€™ll experience your Solar Return on or near your birthday, the time 
      when the transiting Sun comes home to the exact place of your natal Sun, 
      setting the tone and theme for the coming year. The first three weeks of 
      the month may find you feeling like you want to check in to a nice quiet 
      convent or ashram or rehab joint somewhere, spend some down time 
      meditating and retreating from all the craziness. This is a great time to 
      clean up some old loose ends, spend time at the hot springs, a yoga or 
      meditation weekend, hit that 12-step program a little harder, stay out of 
      the bars and off the X, and put in time at the library, university, 
      hospital, prison (hopefully as a volunteer!), or whatever other 
      institution you might be linked to. With the Pisces Sun transiting through 
      your 12th House of Self-Undoing, keep your nose clean nowâ€"figure out in 
      what way you are your own worst enemy, and stifle that behaviorâ€"for a 
      while anyway. 
      <p>On March 20thâ€"sistah!--break out the champagneâ€"the Sunâ€™s crossed 
      over into your first house and the sign of Aries, itâ€™s the spring 
      Equinox, full speed ahead for you rams and lambs, and the Sunâ€™ll be 
      hooking up with Venus, putting an extra bounce in your step and zapping up 
      your love life. Mars through your 2nd house may bring financial 
      opportunities beginning the 7th. On the 1st, it may be a good time to buy 
      property or new furniture to spruce up the love shack. Itâ€™s also an 
      especially good month for group activities with your sewing circle or 
      biker club or drumming gang. 
      <h>TAURUS 
      <p>The Sunâ€™s in your solar 11th house until the 20th. Time spent socially, 
      with your "people", your groups, political activist group, dream circle, 
      folks you have common cause withâ€"can be energetic, exciting, and way 
      fun. Follow that dream, tooâ€"focus on some of your big life goals, both 
      the possible and the impossible ones. Like they say, write it down, make 
      it happen. If youâ€™re in business for yourself, this may be an "up" 
      period for your balance sheet. This is a great time to bring in new people 
      into your circle, make new friends, making your goals public. 
      <p>On March 20th, when the Sun moves into your solar 12th, things will tend 
      to quiet down for you. Do some spring cleaning, paint the kitchen, pay off 
      your credit card, do a cleanse, get off your Taurus "tochas" and go for a 
      hike or a weekend bike ride. Spend some down time with a few close 
      friends, a lover, a cat, or yourselfâ€"get off your earth-bound trip for a 
      while, light some incense, get a tarot reading, have a massage, go hang 
      gliding, or just a nice hot bath with some bath salts and candles and 
      wine. Educational action is good this month. You may get some added 
      responsibilities at work this month, or find you need to tighten your 
      purse strings a little bit. There may be health worries with a parent, or 
      maybe some confusion or delusions or general weirdness at work. The full 
      moon on the 28th may make everybody a little edgy; donâ€™t forget your 
      Full Moon ceremony! 
      <h>GEMINI 
      <p>Emphasis on career this month, boss-type people, maybe even good old Mom. 
      This is a great time to put some extra shine on things at work; Venus in 
      your solar 10th will give you some nice opportunity to mix business with 
      pleasure, too! You might feel inspired artistically, musically, or moved 
      to volunteer some time at the local childrenâ€™s hospital, or to help a 
      friend move (if youâ€™re REALLY a saint!). The pagan festival of Ostara 
      occurs on March 21st, the spring Equinox, which coincides roughly with 
      Easterâ€"a little spring fling is definitely called for. You might be a 
      little more serious and hard-working this month, not quite your usual 
      Gemini motormouth self. Careful who you slip off with for a night of joy 
      this monthâ€"your emotions arenâ€™t as reliable as usual. And there might 
      be a real strong urge to do some spring cleaning around relationships, 
      especially on the 22nd. 
      <h>CANCER 
      <p>Pisces Sun in your solar 9th house this month puts the spotlight on 
      travel, higher education (including online study), publishing, 
      spiritualityâ€"and horses (for all you pony girls and boys)! On the 20th, 
      the emphasis shifts to your career, your reputation, and your status 
      (including new committed relationships). You might push for more money and 
      recognition now, and spend time with Momâ€"if that relationship is rocky, 
      this might be a time to take steps toward healing. You might feel inspired 
      to get actively involved in political or social activism this monthâ€"but 
      donâ€™t be SO enthusiastic that you turn everybody else off! You might 
      tend to weight gain this month so lay off the Oreos. The stars might nudge 
      you toward some real electric sex this month, and it also might be a time 
      for you to finally decide to dump that nowhere job and reach for something 
      more satisfying. 
      <h>LEO 
      <p>The first three weeks of the month may be a good time to think about 
      financial security, to take a look at debts, taxes, mortgages, and your 
      and your partnerâ€™s shared resources. If youâ€™re thinking of getting 
      counseling for any reason, during this period you may have easier access 
      to your dreams and your subconscious mindâ€"all that buried STUFF that 
      needs to get thrown out. Clean out closets, basements, attics. You may get 
      financial or other support from people who want to help out. Long-distance 
      travel, continuing ed, or working with exotic types may happen for you 
      now. After the 20th, you may feel a new energetic push at work in your 
      career. Jupiter going direct in your 12th house may help improve health 
      issues, especially with stomach and digestion. And keep openâ€"you may 
      meet somebody truly magical and excitingâ€"and friendship may turn to 
      looooooove! 
      <h>VIRGO 
      <p>This is a month for romance, tying the knot, signing a contract with a 
      business partner, bursting into the public eye if youâ€™re a performer. 
      Itâ€™s also a great month to start a new relationship, or buff up your 
      current oneâ€"make some resolutions together to strengthen the bond. You 
      may feel a real drive to fix up the apartmentâ€"new paint, new pix on the 
      wallâ€"or maybe something even more ambitiousâ€"tearing out a wall and 
      putting in new linoleum in the kitchen. Toward the 20th of the month start 
      taking a look at your investments, taxes (you may have filed an 
      extension), how the two of you manage your joint bank account or household 
      budget, or if youâ€™re in business together, getting that start-up loan or 
      seed money from a backer. From the 15th onâ€"possible chances for new 
      romance! 
      <h>LIBRA 
      <p>Emphasis for the first three weeks of this month are on your job (NOT your 
      career!) your health, your pets, and your employeesâ€"if you have any! For 
      those fortunate souls whose jobs are also their career, attention you pay 
      to streamlining your efficiency and effectiveness on the job could pay off 
      in increased profits for you. Also, if you have healing skills and 
      talents, these first three weeks are a great time to attend a workshop, or 
      add something new to your healerâ€™s tool kit. 
      <p>After the 20th, the Sun moves into Libraâ€™s FAVORITE houseâ€"the 7th, 
      house of partnership, marriage, committed relationships, as well as 
      business partnerships, legal contests, and the Public Eyeâ€"where some 
      Venus-ruled Libras love to be! From the 20th on is a great time for a 
      commitment ceremony, signing a partnership or business agreement, settling 
      a lawsuit, or moving in with Ms. Wonderful. 
      <p>The new moon in Libra on the 28th is a great time to start a new 
      projectâ€"just not a dietâ€"wait until just after the full moon for that! 
      As the Moon gets smallerâ€"hopefully you will too! 
      <h>SCORPIO 
      <p>Lucky Scorpio! This is your month to have some fun! Creativity, romance, 
      entertainment, gambling, playing or watching sportsâ€"and kidsâ€"all these 
      things are a great place for Scorpio to focus on in March. Any 
      kid-centered projectâ€"childrenâ€™s theatre, day care, starting a baby, 
      adopting a childâ€"is favored for you this month. Itâ€™s not really the 
      time to try to get serious in a relationshipâ€"this time is better for 
      just having some romantic, casual fun. Wait until late April to move in 
      together! 
      <p>Those in a tight relationship might run the risk of have a little domestic 
      spat this monthâ€"resolve ahead of time to agree to disagreeâ€"and fight 
      fair! 
      <p>After the 20th, itâ€™s time to focus special attention on your job and 
      your health. If youâ€™ve been promising yourself youâ€™re going to start 
      lifting, or running, or walking, or even crawling, this is a great time. 
      Just say no to that third helping of Heath Bar Crunch. 
      <p>Hold off any serious spending that involves you and your 
      partnerâ€"instead, you may suddenly decide to re-wire the apartment just 
      for laughs. 
      <h>SAGITTARIUS 
      <p>It might be a little early to be getting the garden ready for 
      plantingâ€"but all 4th house activities are highlighted for Sag this 
      monthâ€"home, hearth, family, the house, gardeningâ€"sometimes "dad" 
      issues are favored now tooâ€"if you need to mend fences with the old guy, 
      this is a time to make steps. Social events at home are favoredâ€"and even 
      though you Sagittarii have trouble staying in one place for long, this 
      might be a good time to put in some work around the house, or stay home 
      and study hard for midterms. For some Sadges, this is the month to tie the 
      knot; for others, if things are looking bleak in the relationship 
      department, this may be the period when it gets over with for good. 
      <p>Things speed up at work this month; this is also a good time to invest 
      some cash in something conservative like a bond fund or utilitiesâ€"you 
      might also get a nice little financial windfallâ€"pay down your credit 
      card debt! 
      <p>If youâ€™re into the arts, this is a great time for creative 
      effortsâ€"write that new song, get your novel finished, go get another 
      tattoo, show yourself off at a slam poetry reading! 
      <h>CAPRICORN 
      <p>Neighborhood and community matters shine for you the front part of the 
      monthâ€"and if that seems pretty boring, how about your evil siblings, 
      uncles and aunts, communications of all kinds (teaching, learning, the 
      news, reading, writing, cheat sheets, documents, mental/intellectual 
      work), and lots of short trips and travel? After the 20th, pull in your 
      focus to your own home and family and circle of loved ones. 
      <p>Work may get intenseâ€"you might find yourself working overtime, or being 
      handed extra responsibilitiesâ€"donâ€™t let yourself be a workaholic, 
      which Capricorn can be prone to. Capricorns tend to rise through 
      administrative and management kinds of work, so if they hand you a bunch 
      of extra assignments, show â€˜em what you can do! It may lead to a 
      promotion. 
      <p>Your snoop factor may be get a big boost this month with Pluto in the 
      12thâ€"investigative, behind the scenes, and research work might be just 
      what youâ€™re good at right now. 
      <h>AQUARIUS 
      <p>Money, money, moneyâ€"financial matters get the spotlight the first three 
      weeks of Marchâ€"specifically, money you earn directly through workâ€"not 
      your investments, tax return, lotto ticket or trust fund! Your income, 
      your personal possessions (your furniture, DVD player, Twister game) and 
      your valuesâ€"the things that really matter to you--get the highlights. 
      The 2nd house is also ruled by Ms. Sensuous herselfâ€"Venusâ€"you and your 
      main squeeze might try something a little new and different this month in 
      the passion departmentâ€"maybe a new flavor of Kama Sutra oil? Something 
      featuring feathers? 
      <p>Then, on the 20th, itâ€™s out of the sack and onto the sidewalk as the 
      focus moves more toward community type involvements in your neighborhood, 
      calling your brother in St. Louis, or taking your Real Estate exams. 
      <p>Youâ€™ve also got the universe pulling for you this month as you sit down 
      with pencil and paper and really get serious about your dreams and your 
      goals. 
      <h>PISCES 
      <p>This month, the spotlight is on you, yes, YOU, Pisces person! So get the 
      gum out of your hair, find your car keys, find out if your 1997 tax return 
      is actually somewhere back in the closet behind that stack of songs you 
      wrote five years agoâ€"and put your best foot forward. This is about 
      youâ€"your charisma, your leadership (?), making a good first impression, 
      and kicking off an important new project (a great time to start something 
      new would be the new moon on the 13th). 
      <p>Then, on the 20th, uh-oh, money. Actually, it might be a good time to 
      boost your income, or balance your checkbook (z-z-z-z) or ask for a raise. 
      Things might get serious around the house at some point during the 
      monthâ€"you might have to get that leak in the basement fixed or move all 
      your tropical fish tanks out of the spare bedroom. Things might get shook 
      up a little if you work at an institution, like a library or schoolâ€"but 
      this might also be a great time to get the boss to take you a little more 
      seriously tooâ€"things could move up a notch for you in the career 
      department this monthâ€"make your move! 
      
      <p>Want to know more about your horoscope? You can run a chart for free at 
      www.astro.com. Youâ€™ll need to know your date of birth, place of birth, 
      and exact time of birth. Your birth certificate is a more reliable source 
      than mom, usually. 






      <h>PA Dutch Recipes
      <p>For anyone fortunate enough to be passing through PA, the culinary 
      experience is something you will never forget and want to repeat in your 
      own kitchen. 
      <p>These folks originally populated Pennsylvania in the 1680s and were 
      primarily Mennonites, Seventh Day Baptists, Moravians, Amish, and a few 
      other groups. They were soon joined by Reformed and Lutherans. These 
      Germanic groups brought with them the recipe secrets and kitchen magic 
      that makes Pennsylvania Dutch cooking so sought after. 
      <p>The term PA Dutch is not an accurate as they are Germanic in heritage. The 
      German way to say German is Deutsch and Dutch is a bastardization of that. 
      Here, each month, you will find some of the most wonderful taste delights 
      which require relatively little creativity in the kitchen, just follow the 
      directions!
      <h>Funnel Cake
      <p>3 eggs 
      <p>2 cups milk 
      <p>4 cups flour 
      <p>1/3 cup sugar 
      <p>1 Tablespoon baking powder 
      <p>Oil for frying 
      <p>Beat eggs and add milk. Sift dry ingredients together and beat the 
      egg-milk mixture into it. Continue beating until batter is smooth. Let 
      stand while you heat the oil to 375 degrees. You need at least 3 or 4 
      inches of oil. 
      <p>Batter can be poured into a small pitcher for easier handling. Use a 
      funnel closed off at the end by your finger. The funnel should have an 
      opening of at least 1/2 inch and be able to hold around a cup of batter. 
      Pour some batter into the funnel. Take your finger off the end and swirl 
      the batter in concentric circles into the hot oil. Fry until golden brown 
      on both sides. Drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with powdered sugar or 
      cinnamon sugar, and serve hot. Or you can serve them with maple syrup or a 
      table molasses (like King syrup) for breakfast. 
       <h>Corn Fritters
      <p>6 ears of corn, scrapped
      <p>3 eggs, beaten
      <p>2 TBSP. flour, or more
      <p>Salt and Pepper, to taste
      <p>Mix together and fry on greased griddle like pancakes. These are served as 
      a vegetable side dish. These are good! Great for snackin'.
