      <p>The American Beauty Project will honor the Grateful Dead’s Dead’s two 
      storied 1970 albums, American Beauty and Workingman’s Dead -- albums 
      comprised of true hymns to Americana, and created during a period in the 
      band's history that they were compared to a Charles Ives village green 
      band -- with two free concerts under the glass atrium of the World 
      Financial Center Winter Garden (directly across the street from the World 
      Trade Center site in lower Manhattan), Saturday and Sunday, January 20 and 
      21, 2007. Performing their own arrangements of the songs will be Mark 
      Eitzel (American Music Club), Tim O’Reagan (The Jayhawks), Catherine 
      Russell, The Holmes Brothers, Ollabelle, Jay Farrar (Son Volt/Uncle 
      Tupelo), Jorma Kaukonen (Jefferson Airplane/Hot Tuna), Toshi Reagon, Dar 
      Williams, Jim Lauderdale, Jen Chapin, Larry Campbell (Bob Dylan, Phil Lesh 
      & Friends), Andy Statman, The Klezmatics, Tony Trischka, and many more!
