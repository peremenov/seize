Brain Teasers 
<h>SILLY COW. 
<p>Sidney and his wife Flora were sitting in a 
            restaurant eating. Suddenly, Flora noticed a handbag on the floor. 
            Just as Sidney was slicing his fresh cabbage, on all fours, the cow 
            stole money. Why?  

             <h>SEQUENCE IN THE SAND.
			 <p>As the pirates rowed Tainted Angel, their 
            ship, away from the Greek island where they had rested, left behind 
            in the sand was a message (shown below) that a shipmate had written 
            about their captain, Short John Sliver. What did it say? 

       <h>ALIEN MUTATIONS. 
	   <p>Shown right are 12 mutation chambers labelled A-L. Each 
      of the four aliens on the left passes through the three chambers directly 
      to the right to finish as the alien on the right (e.g. the alien to the 
      left of A passes through A, B, C to finish as the one to the right of C). 
      <p>Also, each of the three aliens at the top passes through the four chambers 
      directly below to finish as the 
	  alien at the bottom. 
	  <p>Every chamber 
      performs a mutation and does so on one part of the body (e.g. makes head 
      square). What does each of the 12 chambers do? 
      <h>LOGICAL LIGHT-UP. 
	  <p>As Miss Earwig entered the interview room, her four 
      inquisitors sat behind the oak table watching her. Earwig mentally 
      numbered them from 1-4 left to right and noted the following facts. The 
      pipe smoker sat immediately to the right of Mr Blowtorch. Mr Crumpet did 
      not smoke cigarettes. Neither Mr Crumpet nor Mr Drivel were third. The 
      cigarette smoket sat immediately to the left of Mr Amoeba. Mr Crumpet was 
      not the cigar smoker. The cigar smoker sat immediately to the left of the 
      cigarette smoker. The cigar smoker was neither second nor third. Assuming 
      no interrogator smoked two different items, can you find the name and 
      smoking habit for each position? 
      <h>WORD PLAY. 
	  <p>Seven members of the Hollywood Theatre Company were being cast 
      in a post-Chaucer staging (4,6,2,7). The payment for playing the 
      characters followed a ranking system as follows. Hanks was playing a 
      character ranked 3 places below Cage's and 10 places above Foster's. 
      Kidman's character was 3 positions below Everett's and 11 places below 
      Stone's. Olivier's character was 9 places above Foster's and 5 places 
      above Stone's. What was the play (5,2) and who was Cage playing 
      (4,6,2,7)?
	  <h>THE SLUG AND THE SNAIL. 
	  <p>A slug and a snail decided to settle a 
      long-standing argument as to who was the best sprinter. So they planned a 
      race between two stones set a distance D cm apart. Said the slug to the 
      snail "Since I'm slimier than you, I intend to start T seconds before 
      you". "In that case," said the snail, who was rather slow, "I'm going to 
      give you X cm start". It didn't matter. The slug, who could move at speed 
      V cm/sec, was only half as fast as the snail. The result was a dead heat, 
      t seconds after the slug set off. Now, D,t,T,V and X were all whole 
      numbers from 1 to 10 inclusive, no two numbers being the same. How long 
      did it take the snail to reach the finish?
      <h>FISH FEAST. 
	  <p>A shoal of fish (shown right) were enjoying a swim when the 
      fish at X decided to eat the five fish A-E. This he did by moving only 
      along the blue lines, visiting each position once only and finally 
      returning to X to swim with the shoal. Now C was eaten some time before D 
      who was not the last eaten, B was devoured some time before A and the 
      route that was taken did not cross over itself at O. Can you draw the 
      route that X took? 
	  <h>CONNECT FOUR. 
	  <p>Which one of the following words is the 
      odd one out and why?
            <l>aviary
            <l>cagey
            <l>detain
            <l>devious

      <h>ARMLESS ALIENS. 
	  <p>On planet ?*!@, the inhabitants are robots with various 
      numbers of arms. The robots are grouped into tribes according to the 
      numbers of arms they have so that in any tribe, no member has a different 
      number of arms to the other members. Each tribe follows the same fertility 
      ritual before bed each night, a ritual that also reveals the number of 
      members in a tribe. In the ritual, each arm of a male links with an arm of 
      a female, no male-female pair of robots linking more than once. The 
      minimum number of robots required to link all arms once only is the number 
      belonging to that tribe. Now one night, the Creaky tribe cornered half of 
      the Rusty tribe and despite being outnumbered two to one, unscrewed one 
      arm from each, there being an equal number of male and female victims. 
      However, the Creaky tribe were extremely poor at arithmetic and had failed 
      to realise that they needed 24 times their actual haul of spare arms in 
      order that the number of links their members could then make, each with 
      the same number of extra arms, was half the maximum number of links the 
      Rusty tribe could then make. How many Creakies and Rusties were there? 
      <h>THE GREATEST HUMAN BEING. 
	  <p>In a survey to find the greatest human being, 
      the top four people and their occupation were listed in Clock magazine. 
      <p>However, only one entry in each column was correctly positioned. The 
      following facts were true. (1) Albert was two places above the bricklayer, 
      (2) Darling was one place below Charles, (3) Curious was two places below 
      the welder. Can you find the 1st name, surname and occupation for each 
      position?  1st NameSurnameOccupation

	  <h>SOLUTIONS
      <p>To find the solutions page, the following puzzle must be solved. There is 
      a five-digit number having digits 1-9, no two digits being identical. Two 
      are prime numbers, two are square numbers, and one is neither. The third 
      digit is twice the fifth, the fourth is six greater than the second and 
      the last is three less than the first. This five-digit number forms part 
      of the URL for the solutions page. For example, if you think the solution
