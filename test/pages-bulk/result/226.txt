        <h>NOTICE! 12/28/2001 
		<p>Back when Charity gave me permission to list her 
        links, she had found the need to focus her attention at home, rather 
        than on maintaining a website. Although I set out to repair the many 
        links that had gone out of date, I find that life is intervening in way 
        that makes it impossible for me to continue to update this Unit Studies 
        page as well, at least at this time. My brother is now living with us 
        while he fights brain cancer, and our attention is necessarily on his 
        health, wellbeing and happiness. If you find that the unit studies you 
        are interested in are out of date, or the links are broken, try copying 
        the title of the unit and doing a search for it. You can also try 
        searching for the term "unit study". You may be pleasantly surprised. 
        Good luck in your endeavors!!
      ______________________________ 
        <p>Finding materials to use in setting up your daily curriculum can be 
        quite a challenge. We are grateful to Charity Lovelace, of Hilltop 
        Homeschool (no longer available after Sept 15,2000, but we can hope she 
        finds time to share her extraordinary talents again), for putting 
        together this long list of Unit Study sites, and kindly allowing us to 
        copy and share it. Although it does not include any of her own, it is a 
        wealth of good ones.
