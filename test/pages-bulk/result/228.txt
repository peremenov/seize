<h>King Camera used Toon Boom Animation Software for Ad Spot
<p>(Montreal, September 9, 2004) - King Camera has just completed, "A Life", a 
stunning 60-second animated commercial, currently airing on United Airlines 
flights. It was directed by prominent, Oscar Winning Director of "Father and 
Daughter", Michael Dudok de Wit in HD and Toon Boom's USAnimation software was 
used to create the animation effects. "A Life" is part of a series of animated 
commercials for United Airlines produced by Acme Filmworks for the agency 
Fallon/Worldwide of Minneapolis; including "Light Bulb" by Joanna Quinn and 
"Interview" by Wendy Tilby and Amanda Forbis.
<p>"The men from King Camera were experienced, professional, perfectionists and 
they understood the animator's mind. I wanted to rely on their skills totally 
and I could. Wonderful. And on top of that we got on really well." Stated 
Michael Dudok de Wit, Director.
<p>With the objective of recapturing the Oscar, BAFTA, Grand Prix & Prix du Public 
award-winning style of "Father and Daughter", Michael Dudok de Wit decided to 
approach King Camera. System Administrator, Chris King, and creative Senior 
Digital Artist & Compositor, Tim Barter brought the production together. Michael 
initially created colour models in Photoshop while King Camera created special 
purpose built modules to emulate the various Photoshop blending modes used in 
the models. As with Michael's previous work, textures were required, not only 
for the backgrounds but also for all the characters, with some scenes requiring 
the application of over 70 textures at a time. USAnimation's(r) new Opus 
upgrade, coupled with Michael's inimitable line quality with it's subtle 
greyscale variations, achieved the desired effects.
<p>King Camera's full HD capability, teamed with Toon Boom's USAnimations'(r) Opus 
resolution independent software, enabled the output of two versions 
simultaneously; in High Definition (HD) at 24 Frames per second and NTSC formats 
at 30 Frames per second. Tim Barter confirms: "In all we had an extensive use of 
over 1200 textures across the 60 second commercial. So with the additional need 
to perfectly retain Michael's outstanding line quality and output to both Hi Def 
and NTSC within an extremely tight deadline, USAnimation(r) once again proved 
itself to be an ideal tool." Additionally, King Camera's Chris King made use of 
Houdini from Side Effects to create snowfall for the commercial and composite 
NTSC field rendered output from USAnimation's(r) Opus.
<p>The production was highly complex and work intensive, challenged by a deadline 
that was moved forward by two weeks and resulted in Michael creating artwork 
through to the very last days of production. With this in mind, King Camera's 
Senior Digital Artist and Compositor, Tim Barter, decided to structure the 
compositing of the production so that most of the important textures and colour 
models could arrive later without impacting on the deadline. To this effect, 
highly complex compositing modules were created that enabled any characters or 
textures to be plugged into them. Michael's storyboard was then extrapolated to 
create proxy characters that would later be scanned in as the real thing. In the 
process, approximately 1200 proxy textures were created and plugged in, to be 
replaced as and when the correct textures arrived. This meant that the entire 
job could be 'composited' long before the actual artwork arrived, with only 
minor changes to follow.
<p>"The King Camera work ethic is that with proper organisation, communication and 
pre-visualisation, no production should be stressful or over-run beyond the 
normal hours in the day! Wishful thinking perhaps, but for the above reasons, 
working with Michael was an absolute pleasure. Despite Michael's overwhelming 
workload, he was incredibly organised, which made it possible for me to work 
from his storyboards, ensuring that neither of us became dependent on the other 
for material. Michael also had such pre conceived ideas of what he wanted to 
achieve, that I was able to confidently work in unison with him with the 
knowledge that our work wouldn't all become redundant as changes were made 
further down the line. Consequently, despite a curtailed delivery period, a 
massive workload for Michael and the need to work towards both High Definition 
and NTSC outputs, the production was wonderfully stress free." Tim Barter from 
King Camera stated.
