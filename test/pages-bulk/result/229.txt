            <p>I found Anne Collins through my doctor! We had a long discussion one 
            day about my weight and how many diets I had tried etc. He told me 
            to go on-line and find Anne"s site. He was doing research at the 
            time on on-line diets (e-diets etc) and said that Anne's was the 
            only one that was always nutritionally sound and would make sure the 
            weight would come off and stay off! The best advice I was ever 
            given!!

            <p>...my doctor called me personally at work to tell me that I won't 
            have to take cholesterol meds. My LDL was 164. It is now 104! I 
            really feel like my body is ready to let go of the fat and maybe it 
            won't be so hard from now on. Thanks Anne for not letting me give 
up!

      <h>What Members Say About the Forum
        <p>"I have literally dieted 38 of my 48 years and I have learned more in 
        the six weeks since I joined this group than ever before. Oh, I knew all 
        there was to know about calories, fat grams, carbs, etc. I could write 
        my own book. What I have learned....actually, what I am learning is 
        about self-image, positive attitude, etc. I knew all the physical stuff 
        but here I am learning about the mental part of weight loss. I am 
        finding out that is an essential part of any weight loss program."

        <p>"Boy, I love this forum. You can't get this kind of treatment anywhere 
        else, and believe me I have tried WW, Curves, Jenny Craig, everything. 
        Nothing beats Anne. I want to eventually get to 150 lbs. I will be 
        happpy if I just break the terrible 200 lb mark. I haven't seen that in 
        almost 18 years when I had my last child."

            I used shame to motivate myself to reduce weight. That's why I check 
            out your weight loss motivation tips at least once a day. They are 
            not "shame-based"! They are great touchstones to make me think that 
            I really can lose this weight and feel good about myself through the 
            whole dieting process...

            <p>Hi Anne,
            Just wanted to say - from the bottom of my heart - your diet is 
            awesome... Great value, unbelievable support... no other internet 
            diet program I've tried comes close... you are so unbelievably REAL!

            <p>I have lost 60 pounds as of today. I`m on thyroid medicine, I was on 
            prednisone which made me gain weight, but on this diet [cholesterol 
            lowering diet] I started losing even though I was on both 
            medications. I`m on the GI diet now. I love the food on it.

            <p>Hi Anne
            what REALLY impresses me is your customer service. It is simply 
            amazing compared to anything else I've experienced...

            Joining your weight loss program was the best $20 we ever spent, I 
            have lost 50 pounds and my wife has lost 100 pounds! My wife has 
            even been asked a couple of times if she has had gastric bypass. We 
            are quick to tell them, just order your program, follow it, and 
            exercise. I have attached before/after pics of my wife.

            <p>Hi Anne
            I just wanted to thank you for your wonderful web site. I recently 
            completed a 10 week diet sponsored by my work place. With the help 
            of your low carb diet I was able to lose 24 pounds over the 10 week 
            period.... Once again, thanks, I have never felt so wonderful and I 
            think your customer service is awesome.

            <p>Hi Anne
            When I joined your weight loss plan nine months ago, I was confused 
            and bitter about lots of different things in my life - especially my 
            weight. I won't list all these things - the list would be too long!! 
            - but I can say that with your help I can now see some light at the 
            end of the tunnel. Your motivation advice especially has been a huge 
            help. Anyway, I am now 60 pounds lighter... you don't know what a 
            difference you have made to me. Bless You!

            I had a cholesterol screening yesterday at Fred Meyer pharmacy. 
            Blood is from a finger poke vs. a blood draw but the technician said 
            accuracy is within a few points. Since starting the cholesterol 
            lowering diet 11 weeks ago: total cholesterol, down 39 points to 
            197; triglicerides, down 28; HDL (good cholesterol), about the same; 
            LDL (bad cholesterol), down 29 points with a total cholesterol/HDL 
            ratio of 3.8 instead of 4.14. I'm delighted with my progress...

            I would like to thank you for your motivational tips and diet 
            solutions! I am a 28yr old male hispanic, 5ft 4in. In two months, my 
            weight and body stats have changed from 139 pounds, 20 percent body 
            fat, 34 inch waist - to 125 pounds, 13 percent body fat, and 31 inch 
            waist. My activity level has remained constant: lightly active (1-2 
            hours at the gym a week weightlifting, light running)...

            Well, this is my fourth week on the low glycemic diet and I lost 4 
            pounds this week. That's a total of 12 pounds and I actually feel 
            better. I went to the doctor last week and she reduced my insulin 
            dosages, which is terrific...

            Just a quick update for you. As of today, July 22, I am down 90 
            pounds to 180. I have not been this lean since I was 18 years old. I 
            will be 51 in 9 days!

            I am about 5 foot 9, and was weighing 182 pounds. My doctor had just 
            told me that the constant pain in my low back was arthritis and that 
            losing weight would be important to minimizing the effects of the 
            disease over time. Last Friday... he was stunned to look at my chart 
            and see that I now weigh 150 pounds! He applauded my effort. Thank 
            you for your diet.
            <p>Sheila (Illinois)

            <p>Anne, ... my doctor told me yesterday that he didn`t think I needed 
            my zestril [high blood pressure med] He has lowered my thyroid med 
            to about half of what it was. And I`ve been off prednisone now since 
            Aug. ALL THANKS TO YOU. Thanks so much Anne for all you`ve done..
