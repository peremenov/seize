            <p>ANS President Dr. Gail H. Marcus's written testimony on nuclear 
            transportation

            <p>Submitted to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.

            <p>Mr. Chairman, as President of the American Nuclear Society, I 
            appreciate the opportunity to provide a written statement on behalf 
            of ANS regarding transportation issues related to the nuclear waste 
            repository at Yucca Mountain for the committee's hearing.

            <p>ANS' confidence in the safety of high-level waste (HLW) 
            transportation arises from the robustness of the cask design, the 
            demonstrated safety record of HLW transportation and safeguards in 
            the transportation process.  I would like to elaborate on each of 
            these factors.


            <h>Robustness of the Cask Design

            <p>Casks used for shipping spent nuclear fuel are designed to protect 
            against radiation exposure to the public under both normal and 
            accident conditions.  The casks are designed and tested in 
            accordance with requirements established by the Nuclear Regulatory 
            Commission and the Department of Transportation and documented in 
            volumes 10 and 49 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations.

            <p>The casks are about 15 times thicker than a gasoline tank truck 
            shell and they include three inches of stainless steel with thick 
            lead radiation shields.  Typically, for every ton of spent nuclear 
            fuel, there are more than three tons of protective packaging and 
            shielding.

            <p>Casks are designed and tested to withstand crashes, fire, water 
            immersion and puncture.  To be certified, a cask design must 
            withstand a sequence of four tests that measure its performance in 
            specified crash and fire accident conditions.  This means the casks 
            are designed to contain its contents in the event an accident 
occurs.


            <h>Safety Record of Transportation

            <p>Over the past 40 years, about 3,000 shipments of spent nuclear fuel 
            have navigated more than 1.7 million miles of U.S. roads and 
            railways.  Since the early days of HLW transportation, 90 spent fuel 
            casks have been involved in accidents.  None of these accidents 
            resulted in any release of radioactive material.

            <p>It should be noted that the impact tests required by Federal 
            Regulation exert forces on the casks that are greater than the 
            impact forces (g forces) in the worst recorded accidents.  
            Temperatures produced in the casks by the regulatory fire tests are 
            higher than those in any recorded fire accident.

            <p>In addition, Sandia National Laboratories has conducted three 
            extra-regulatory types of tests:

              <l>A 20-ton truck cask struck by a 120-ton diesel locomotive 
              traveling at 81 mph

              <l>A 22-ton cask on a flatbed crashed into a 690-ton concrete block 
              at 84 mph

              <l>A propane tank car exploding next to a cask in a pool fire, 
              throwing the cask 33 feet.

            <p>The casks emerged from these tests with only minor damage, and in 
            none of the tests did the casks fail to hold their contents.

            <p>While there would be more shipments of nuclear waste in the coming 
            years as a result of the opening of Yucca Mountain, the probability 
            of radiation exposure to the public from an accident would remain 
            low because casks of the same design would be used and the same 
            safety procedures would be followed.

            <p>Recently, concerns have been raised about the potential impacts of 
            terrorist attacks during the transport of HLW.  While there are many 
            dimensions to the issue of terrorism that we, as a nation, are only 
            beginning to understand, we can say that the same features that 
            render casks highly resistant to highway and rail accidents tend to 
            make them difficult targets for such attacks.  By comparison, many 
            hazardous chemical and other substances are shipped by truck and 
            rail in less robust containers, and are more apt, if successfully 
            attacked, to result in immediate casualties.


            <h>Safeguards in the Transportation Process

            <p>Public routes used for the transport of nuclear materials must meet 
            strict safety requirements before nuclear fuel is transported.  
            Department of Transportation regulations require carriers of certain 
            controlled radioactive materials, such as spent fuel, to use the 
            safest routes available.  Risk assessments of the transportation of 
            radioactive materials evaluate factors such as accident rate, 
            transit time, population density, other vehicles sharing the route 
            and time of day.

            <p>The DOT identifies "preferred routes," which consist primarily of 
            interstate highways and bypass routes around cities, where such 
            bypass routes exist, or an alternative route selected by a state 
            routing authority.  If the routing authority selects an alternate 
            route, it must demonstrate by a routing analysis that using the 
            alternate route does not increase overall risk.  Alternate route 
            selections must be preceded by consultations between DOT and 
            affected state and local authorities before such designations can go 
            into effect.

            <p>Most materials being transported are monitored by global satellites 
            and are monitored at all times during the transportation process.  
            Specialized trucking companies handle spent nuclear fuel shipments 
            in the United States.  These experienced, specially licensed 
            companies haul all kinds of hazardous materials more than 50 million 
            miles annually.  Vehicles are state of the art, equipped with 
            computers that provide an instantaneous update on the truck's 
            location and convey messages between driver and dispatcher through a 
            satellite communications network.  Drivers receive extensive 
            training and must be certified by the federal government.


            <h>In Summary

            <p>The regulatory requirements on casks and transportation security, 
            and the industry's high level of performance, have produced a safety 
            record that would be difficult to match.  This performance record 
            gives us strong confidence that the transport of spent nuclear fuel 
            to Yucca Mountain can and will be conducted without harm to the 
            public.

            <p>Mr. Chairman, we sincerely appreciate the opportunities to share our 
            views and facts concerning the safety of transporting nuclear fuel.

            <p>The American Nuclear Society is a professional society devoted to 
            advancing nuclear science and technology.
