<h>Muppets 
<p>The Muppets are a family of puppet/marionette characters created by Jim Henson 
in the 1950's. The first, and most, famous Muppet is "Kermit the Frog", created 
in 1955 for a daily two-minute puppet show called, "Sam and Friends." Kermit had 
feet instead of flippers and no collar, becoming "Kermit the Frog" later, in a 
show called "Hey Cinderella." In 1969, the Children's Television Workshop began 
televising Sesame Street, starring Muppet characters, "Bert" and "Ernie", "Oscar 
the Grouch", "Cookie Monster", "Grover", and "Big Bird."
<p>The Muppets got their own television series, a variety show hosted by "Kermit", 
in 1976. It ran for five years and reached audiences in more than 100 countries. 
Among the characters created for the show were "Miss Piggy", "Fozzie the Bear," 
"Gonzo," "Dr. Bunsen Honeydew," "Beaker," and "The Swedish Chef". The Muppets 
also "starred" in a string of films, including, The Muppet Movie, The Muppets 
Take Manhattan, and The Great Muppet Caper. 
<p>There were two other Muppet TV series, one called, Fraggle Rock, and the other, 
The Storyteller.
 
 
<h>the Muppets 
<p>The Muppets are a group of puppets and costume characters, and the company 
created by Jim Henson. Individually, a Muppet is properly one of the puppets 
made by Jim Henson or his Creature Shop – though the term is often used 
erroneously to refer to any puppet that resembles the distinctive style of The 
Muppet Show and Sesame Street characters, the term is both an informal name and 
legal trademark linked to the characters created by The Jim Henson Company. 
After frequently changing hands since the death of creator Jim Henson in 1990, 
The Muppets have been owned by The Walt Disney Company, through the Muppets 
Holding Company, since early 2004.
<p>The word "Muppet" itself was said by Henson to have been created by combining 
the words "marionette" and "puppet"; however, Henson was also known to have 
stated that it was just something he liked the sound of, and he made up the 
"marionette/puppet" story while talking to a journalist because it sounded 
plausible. [1]
<p>Muppets are distinguished from ventriloquist "dummies", which are typically 
animated only in the head and face, in that their arms or other features are 
also mobile and expressive. Muppets are typically made of softer materials. They 
are also presented as being independent of the puppeteer, who is usually not 
visible, hidden behind a set or outside of the camera frame.
<h>Appearance
<p>The most common design for a Jim Henson Muppet is a character with a very wide 
mouth and large protruding eyes. The puppets are often molded or carved out of 
foam rubber, and then covered with fleece. Yarn, nylon string, or (most 
commonly) ostrich feathers are used to create hair. As there is no "eye store" 
from which they can be purchased, Muppet eyes are often made (as in the case of 
the original Kermit) from ping-pong balls, from fishing floats, or from a 
hemispherical toy called a Wacky Stax. Muppets may represent humans, 
anthropomorphic animals, realistic animals, robots or anthropomorphic objects, 
extra-terrestrial creatures, mythical beings or other unidentified, newly 
imagined creatures.
<h>Operation
<p>The puppeteer typically holds the puppet above his head or in front of his body, 
with one hand operating the head and mouth and the other manipulating the hands 
and arms, either with two separate control rods or by "wearing" the hands like 
gloves. One consequence of this design is that most Muppets are left handed as 
the puppeteer uses his right hand to operate the head while operating the arm 
rod with his left hand. There are many other common designs and means of 
operation. In advanced puppets, several puppeteers may control a single 
character; the performer who controls the mouth usually provides the voice for 
the character. As technology has evolved, the Jim Henson team and other 
puppeteers have developed an enormous variety of means to operate puppets for 
film and television, including the use of suspended rigs, internal motors, 
remote radio control, and computer enhanced and superimposed images. Creative 
use of a mix of technologies has allowed for scenes in which Muppets appear to 
be riding a bicycle, rowing a boat, and even dancing onstage with no puppeteer 
in sight.
<h>Famous Muppets
 
<p>The Muppets in Weezer's 'Keep Fishin'
<p>"Famous Muppets include Kermit the Frog, 
Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo, Big Bird, Bert and Ernie, Elmo, and Oscar the 
Grouch. The most widely known television shows featuring Muppets are Sesame 
Street, Fraggle Rock, and The Muppet Show. A recurring adult-oriented cast of 
Muppets (in a setting known as the “Land of Gortch”) were part of the first 
season of Saturday Night Live. Other, less popular series have included The Jim 
Henson Hour and Muppets Tonight. The puppet characters of Farscape, The 
Storyteller, The Hoobs, and Dinosaurs, as well as from the films Labyrinth, 
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and The Dark Crystal, are not considered Muppets, 
although they were also made by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. For a history of Jim 
Henson's Muppets, see Jim Henson.
<p>After earlier unsuccessful attempts, The Walt Disney Company finally bought the 
Muppets in 2004. Exceptions include characters appearing on Sesame Street (as 
they were previously sold to Sesame Workshop), the Fraggles of Fraggle Rock, 
along with the above-mentioned non-"Muppet"-brand characters.
<p>The show's popularity has been so expansive that Muppet characters have been 
treated as celebrities in their own right, including presenting at the Academy 
Awards, making cameos in Rocky III and An American Werewolf in London, and being 
interviewed on the newsmagazine 60 Minutes. Kermit the Frog was interviewed 
early on in Jon Stewart's run on The Daily Show, and Michael Parkinson once 
famously interviewed Miss Piggy on his UK chatshow.
<p>Muppet-like and Muppet-inspired puppets star in the 2004 Tony Award-winning 
Broadway musical Avenue Q (which disavows any relationship with Sesame Workshop 
or the Jim Henson Company).
<h>America's Next Muppet
<p>In 2005, ABC announced it was purchasing a six-episode mini-series titled 
America's Next Muppet. The mini-series is going to be produced by The Jim Henson 
Company for Disney, and is going to be a direct parody of America's Next Top 
Model. The show is going to feature many famous Muppets holding a talent contest 
to find the next Muppet to add to their famous group. The show was tentatively 
scheduled to air in spring or summer of 2006, but there has been no public 
mention in recent months.
<h>Regional usage
<p>In Great Britain and in Ireland the word muppet has come to be used as a mild 
term of abuse, meaning a stupid, incompetent, or moronic person, or the obvious 
interpretation of someone who is inanimated or somehow not there. It can also be 
applied (in the United Kingdom but not in Ireland) to an aesthetically 
displeasing individual.
<p>The Swedish translation mupp is often used in a similar manner.
<p>The term muppetry is also rapidly gaining popularity as a description for an 
individual, or group of people collectively behaving in a muppet like fashion. 
The origins are believed to have come from workers in large organisations, who 
were unhappy with the low to non-existent level of thought or application, that 
other colleagues put into their work. For example - "I'm sorry the figures will 
be late this quarter, due to the high amount of muppetry going on in the 
accounts department", or "Gregory's muppetry appears to have been infectious."
<h>Cultural references
  <l>In The Simpsons episode 3F15: "A Fish Called Selma", actor Troy McClure stars 
  in the fictional film The Muppets Go Medieval. Kermit and Miss Piggy are shown 
  as well. Homer tries to explain what a muppet is with "It's not quite a mop, 
  and it's not quite a puppet, but man...(laughs)...So to answer your question, 
  I don't know." Later in the episode, Selma and Troy McClure are watching the 
  movie on a drive-in movie screen, and before kissing, they speak right along 
  with the characters. 
  <l>The film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels: "Hatchet" Harry: "I don't want 
  to know who you use, as long as they're not complete muppets." 
  <l>The music video for the Weezer song "Keep Fishin', is premised on the band 
  performing on The Muppet Show and features appearances by several characters. 
  <l>On September 28, 2005, the United States Postal Service released a Jim Henson 
  and the Muppets postage stamp series.[1] 
  <l>The 1987 film Dragnet: As a car chase crashes through a carnival display of 
  stuffed animals: Friday: "Look out! Muppets!" 
  <l>A skit on the MTV series The State involved dinner guests luring generic 
  Muppets to their window, catching them and eating them. 
  <l>In the 2005 animated Teen Titans episode "Bunny Raven... or How To Make A 
  Titanimal Disappear", the final scene takes place in a theatre that resembles 
  the set of The Muppet Show. There is a puppet Amazing Mumbo stage manager that 
  mimics Kermit's mannerisms and a pithy one-liner joke is delivered by two 
  Mumbos that look like Statler & Waldorf. 
  <l>In "The Goodies" episode titled "Earthanasia", Tim, Bill and Graeme are 
  waiting for the end of the world. As Tim does some ironing, he explains that 
  there will be no more Muppets when the world ends. Graeme then explains that 
  they are just puppets and even takes some socks and imitates the voices of 
  Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy, which causes Tim to go insane. 
  <l>Originating from Australia, "Muppet" is used as a derogatory and racist term 
  describing someone of African descent who is commonly viewed as an incompetent 
  immigrant worker. 
  <l>In a Family Guy episode, in one of Peter's visions, he was watching Lost on 
  TV, and there was a balcony with Statler & Waldorf saying "Lost? I'll say! I 
  couldn't follow any of it!" 
  <l>In "Worms 3D", a certain voice box of worms has a death sentence that says 
  "You Muppet!" 
  <l>On an episode of Saturday Night Live in which pop singer Justin Timberlake 
  hosted, one sketch featured Timberlake and Kermit the Frog performing a duet 
  of Rainbow Connection. 
<h>Some Muppets and their performers
