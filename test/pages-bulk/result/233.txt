             <h>Why Are You Wearing That Parachute?
                  By Robin McCulloch
                  <p>I remember the gesture very clearly. It was done with a care 
                  for detail that informed all the work we did as 
                  improvisational performers. It was like seeing one of those 
                  international symbols inside the red circle, “no smoking,” “no 
                  left turn” or “no dogs allowed.” I would be on stage in front 
                  of a couple of hundred people, improvising a scene I had 
                  pitched to one of my improv collaborators. Suddenly you see 
                  the fear in their eyes; the hand would go to the chest as if 
                  clasping something and then the distinct pull away from the 
                  chest followed by the smile, half mocking, half seeking 
                  forgiveness. Your improv partner had “hit the chutes”. The 
                  gesture was that of pulling the ripcord on a parachute and 
                  meant that they were bailing out. They sensed the scene was 
                  going down in flames and as it hadn’t been there idea in the 
                  first place, why stick around for the crash.
                  <p>Does this have a familiar ring? Have you felt the clarion call 
                  of the washroom sirens just as the meeting took a turn for the 
                  worse? Or watched a colleague bail out on you when things 
                  started to get tough? Maybe one of your kids broke a rule, 
                  needs to be “spoken to” so knowing your spouse is better at 
                  “that sort of thing” you head out to “clean” the garage.
                  <p>And we had no real excuse. We were supposed to be, arguably, 
                  some of the best professional improvisers in the world. We 
                  were on stage at the Toronto wing of The Second City, the 
                  Mecca of improvisational comedy. A stage that had been, or 
                  would be, graced by John Candy, Catherine O’Hara, and the rest 
                  of their SCTV comrades, Mike Myers, Gilda Radner and Dan 
                  Aykroyd…a very long list of accomplished improvisers and 
                  actors. Also, the concept of “hitting the chutes”, as we 
                  referred to it, was against the very principles of 
                  improvisation. Support, agreement, acceptance and saying “yes” 
                  to each new offer, these were the foundation of good 
                  improvisation.
                  <p>So why would such accomplished improvisational performers 
                  abandon each other to certain theatrical death? Maybe to 
                  understand the fear you need to be aware of exactly what was 
                  being attempted in the first place. There is a cyclical nature 
                  to the creative process that exists at The Second City so it’s 
                  always hard to know where to break into that cycle to start 
                  the explanation. But let’s assume that a show has already been 
                  created by you and your fellow cast members. Each night you 
                  would do that set show, two acts, ninety minutes total, on 
                  average, of memorized material. Then after taking a curtain 
                  call you would get suggestions from the audience in various 
                  categories: current events, occupations, pet peeves, etc. You 
                  would take the suggestions back stage while the audience, you 
                  hoped, would seek out that perfect mix of alcohol intoxication 
                  that makes the jokes seem funnier but doesn’t make the 
                  audience think they’re funnier than the people on stage.
                  <h>The Pitch
                  <p>Once you have the suggestions backstage, posted on the 
                  bulletin board, you would immediately start pitching ideas to 
                  each other based on a combination of suggestions or a single 
                  suggestion or, to be honest, on something you had thought of 
                  that afternoon while gazing at a waitress in a bar. You would 
                  have fifteen minutes to pitch a couple of ideas, get someone 
                  to buy into one or more of them, rope someone into the 
                  thankless roll doing the grunt work to introduce your 
                  brilliant concept, exchange some quick ideas about characters, 
                  grab a drink and smoke before the lights start coming back up 
                  for the post-show improv set. 
                  <p>Sound like some work meetings you’ve been in lately? No time 
                  to solve too many problems while the folks that pay your 
                  salary wait to see what kind of brilliant concepts you 
                  discover.
                  <p>While some of the other performers are out on stage taking 
                  their chances you’re backstage, going over, in your head, how 
                  you imagine the scene playing out. Then your turn arrives. The 
                  lights come up to find you on stage and immediately things 
                  start to change from the course you had imagined. The 
                  performer you had enlisted to do the compulsory role of the 
                  hotel Doorman has decided that the scene really revolves 
                  around him. It is no longer a scene about two lovers sneaking 
                  into a hotel for an afternoon tryst, but one about a Doorman 
                  who secretly suffers from leprosy. Some initial shtick about a 
                  one-handed Doorman suddenly makes your original partner decide 
                  that the scene is no longer what they had agreed to and they 
                  are refusing to enter. It doesn’t take long for the Doorman to 
                  realize the leprosy joke is just that, a joke, and will not 
                  carry a scene very far. He uses his good hand to clasp the 
                  imaginary ripcord on his chest, hits the chute and exits, 
                  leaving you alone, looking at your watch as the lights fade to 
                  a smattering of confused applause. 
                  <p>I’m betting you can see the parallels with trying to pitch 
                  your concept, which you thought your partner was fully behind, 
                  for the new project. Suddenly he has a second possibility that 
                  he has “just thought of” and the other members of the team 
                  have come down with laryngitis. 
                  <h>The Post Mortem
                  <p>What went wrong is that a group of highly competitive 
                  individuals were attempting create something new in front of 
                  two hundred people who had just seen ninety minutes of one 
                  laugh after another. The audience didn’t know that the set 
                  show they had just laughed through had started out as first 
                  time improvisations in an improv set like the one they were 
                  now watching. That it had been worked, re-worked, re-written 
                  and rehearsed for months. No one told the audience that the 
                  performers were abandoning the principles that made them 
                  successful. How could they know that the very laughs that the 
                  performer got as they backed off stage, at the expense of the 
                  scene and fellow performers, were dooming the scene to 
failure?
                  <p>I am sure you have all witnessed a fellow colleague getting 
                  some laughs as they threw someone to the wolves to save their 
                  own hide. You watch all that work go down the drain because 
                  someone started feel the pressure and decided to hit the 
chute.
                  <p>So what is the difference, then, between success and failure 
                  in improvisation? Pretty much the same as it is in other 
                  aspects of work and life. You can usually trace it back to 
                  commitment. How much do you buy-in to the concept in the first 
                  place? How committed are you to the team? If saying “yes” is 
                  really just a subtly disguised “no” in the form of “okay I’ll 
                  go out there with you but I don’t think this is going to 
                  work”, then you can almost hear the ripcord being pulled as 
                  the lights come up. That gentle fluttering you hear is the 
                  room emptying even though the bodies may still be there.
                  <h>The Solution
                  <p>To improvise well, you commit yourself on two levels, first, 
                  to the principles of improvisation, acceptance, support, 
                  justification, saying “yes”, and second, to the specifics of 
                  the scene you are improvising. And your commitment can’t be 
                  dependent on things staying the same because change is 
                  inevitable.
                  <p>The audiences at The Second City are usually very forgiving 
                  because they understand that making it up on the spot is 
                  difficult but is also rewarding when it all comes together in 
                  a magical experience that seems too good to believe. But it is 
                  one thing to be in the audience when it doesn’t come together 
                  and quite another to be one of those poor souls on stage, 
                  descending into comedy hell. Nothing quite focuses the 
                  survival instincts like that first smell of failure; the first 
                  realization that, Martian surgeons discovering why we have an 
                  appendix, may only be funny to you. And once the not-funny 
                  veil starts to descend over a scene most uncommitted 
                  improvisers start to hear their mothers calling them home for 
                  dinner or if not for dinner at the very least, OFF STAGE! 
                  <p>But when you see improvisation that is committed from the 
                  start, ideas that seemed doomed at birth suddenly take the 
                  most unexpected turns and become these amazing products of 
                  positive cooperation. The desperate search for the “Big Idea” 
                  seems unnecessary. “Big Ideas” go nowhere without support and 
                  commitment. “Bad ideas” can develop into great concepts with a 
                  supportive, committed process.
                  <p>The Second City was my office. Improvisation was the work I 
                  did there. And the one thing above all others that made the 
                  difference between failure and success was the level of 
                  commitment.
                  <p>Understanding the value of real commitment, to the team and to 
                  the concept, can improve a team’s success rate and innovative 
                  potential dramatically.
                  <p>Think about this the next time you join a new project or 
                  things seem to be going off the tracks or you realize your 
                  Doorman only has one hand. When you feel yourself reaching for 
                  that imaginary ripcord, ask yourself if you’re really 
                  committed or you’re just “hitting the chute”? Throw your 
                  parachute in the garbage because nothing is more exciting or 
                  rewarding than using your support and imagination to turn 
                  defeat into victory. And improvisation embodies the principles 
                  that allow you to create solutions in a parachute free 
                  workplace.
