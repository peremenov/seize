      <h>WHY? 
      <p>The Archaeology Channel is a visitor-supported nonprofit public service. 
      Income from Memberships is essential for continued operation of this 
      service. Please help supply the cash needed to deliver the programming you 
      want—become a Member of The Archaeology Channel. Don’t expect others to 
      carry the load—step up now and make a difference! 

      <p>At this time, Memberships are our primary source of revenue to pay the 
      bills. 
      <h>HOW MUCH? 
      <p>Annual Memberships to The Archaeology Channel are available in the 
      following categories: Child (US$18), Student (US$25), Limited or fixed 
      income (US$20), Individual (US$45), Organizations (US$250), Lifetime 
      (US$1000), and Quantum Benefactor (US$5000). These are suggested amounts 
      only : send us any amount that you can afford and we will include you in 
      our Membership roster! Because ALI is registered as a non-profit, 
      tax-exempt (501[c][3]) organization in the US, the Membership fee is fully 
      tax-deductible for US citizens and residents. 
      <h>WHAT DO I GET? 
      <p>First and foremost, you will know that you have played a valuable role in 
      sharing the valuable messages of archaeology and indigenous peoples. As a 
      Member of The Archaeology Channel , unless you choose to be anonymous, you 
      will be included on the Membership roll on this website and recognized as 
      one who has stepped forward to support this innovative public service. You 
      will receive a gift as part of your Membership as well as a Membership 
      certificate documenting your support of our valuable work. We will not 
      share your contact information with other organizations. Your Membership 
      can also be obtained through your generous in-kind contribution. This may 
      also be tax-deductible. /font>

      <h>What Membership Fees Will Pay For 
      <h>Short-Term Goals and Activities: 
      <p>Meet the costs of webcasting. Monthly costs of video and audio streaming, 
      which will grow as our web traffic increases. 
      <p>Continued web site development. Upgrading this web site is critical to 
      maintaining its function and attracting an audience. 
      <p>Bring you new programming, including more audio interviews, commentaries, 
      and news as well as videos from others and our own video productions. 
      <p>The Endangered Languages Project, which will bring you the sounds and 
      messages of languages threatened with extinction. 
      <p>Organize an Archaeological Field School for Teachers, to promote and 
      assist in the use of archaeology as a classroom teaching tool. 
      <p>Work with partners, including teachers to develop and deliver school 
      curricula through The Archaeology Channel. 
      <p>Write grant proposals to secure support for TAC programs and development. 
      <p>Hire two or three paid staff instead of relying completely on volunteer 
      help. 
      <p>Buy a mini-DV video camcorder to play tapes for video capture and encoding 
      and for shooting our own video footage. 
      <p>Send a representative to regional and national conferences to promote The 
      Archaeology Channel and develop partnerships that will bring you valuable 
      programming. 
      <p>Organize an Archaeological Film and Video Festival. We have already begun 
      preliminary planning for this event, to be held in July of 2003. 

      <h>Some Longer-term Goals and Activities: 
      <p>Establish a fund for sending a videographer to important discovery 
      locations to capture footage you can see on The Archaeology Channel. 
      Create virtual tours of important archaeological sites (e.g., Pompei, 
      Stonehenge, Mesa Verde) for you to see on The Archaeology Channel. 
      Set up webcams so you can watch ongoing archaeological excavations. 
      Stream an indigenous-peoples radio station through The Archaeology Channel 
      .
