      <h>The Open Architecture Network 
      <p>Architecture for Humanity is building a new space to collaborate online. 
      The Open Architecture Network will be a gathering place for community 
      designers and all those interested in improving the built environment. 
      Here designers of all persuasions can post their projects, browse projects 
      posted by others, comment and review projects, discuss relevant topics, 
      contribute to shared resources, collaborate with each other and access 
      project management tools to support their work. 
      <p>We imagine a site that not only helps create, support and implement ideas, 
      but also a place that fosters sustainable, replicable, adaptable and 
      scalable design solutions. The network has a simple mission: to generate 
      design opportunities that will improve living standards for all. 
      <p>The Sapling Foundation is currently matching upwards of $125,000 for the 
      Open Architecture Network. and we are looking for your help to meet their 
      challenge. To support the network, just type "Open Architecture" in the 
      comments field when you make your donation.

      <h>Rebuilding after Hurricane Katrina

      <p>One Year after the storm, families are beginning to rebuild in New Orleans 
      and across the Gulf Coast. Architecture for Humanity is sponsoring and 
      supporting a number of projects across the coast. From pairing architects 
      with community groups and families in New Orleans to supporting the work 
      of the Gulf Coast Community Design Studio to sponsoring the Model Home 
      program. 
      <h>Biloxi House Fair and Model Home Program



      <p>To help mark the progress made in bringing families home to Biloxi, 
      Architecture for Humanity partnered with the Biloxi Relief, Recovery and 
      Revitalization Center, the Salvation Army and a number of volunteer groups 
      working in the area to host a House Tour and Design Fair. The fair also 
      launched the start of the Model Home program, a pilot program to provide 
      design services and financial assistance for the construction of a number 
      of new homes for families in East Biloxi whose houses were destroyed by 
      Hurricane Katrina.

      solutions to such urgent needs as basic shelter, health care, education, 
      and access to clean water, energy, and sanitation. Featured projects

      undertaken independently, often against great odds.

      <h>Tsunami Reconstruction
      <p>On December 26th 2004, a series of earthquakes occurred in the area of the

      a further 4 million were forced from their homes.

      initiated, designed and built a number of community structures including 
      schools, community halls, medical clinics and livelihood centers. All 
      projects have been designed and developed under the Creative Commons 
      Developing Nations License allowing other NGOs and community group to 
      replicate and adapt our projects. Our projects in India are being run by 
      Purnima McCutcheon and in Sri Lanka by Susi Platt.
