            <h>U.S. Pushes to Restart North Korea Talks 
            Paul Kerr 
            <p>After a fresh series of provocative North Korean actions, Assistant 
            Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Christopher 
            Hill traveled to China, Japan, and South Korea late last month in 
            another effort to restart six-party talks designed to eliminate 
            Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons program. The talks, which also include 
            Russia, have been stalled for nearly a year.

            <p>A Bush administration official, as well as a congressional source 
            familiar with the matter, told Arms Control Today that recent North 
            Korean statements, along with a modest amount of new intelligence, 
            have increased U.S. officials’ concern that North Korea may test 
            nuclear weapons. Pyongyang has not tested such weapons, although it 
            has threatened to do so.

            <p>In addition, a senior North Korean diplomat said April 18 that 
            Pyongyang had halted the operation of its five-megawatt nuclear 
            reactor, an action that could permit it to obtain additional 
            plutonium for use as fissile material in nuclear weapons. The 
            announcement came approximately two months after North Korea 
            announced that it possesses nuclear weapons.

            <p>The United States believes that North Korea possesses one or two 
            plutonium-based nuclear weapons and may possess enough fissile 
            material for several more. Whether Pyongyang is in the process of 
            augmenting its purported nuclear arsenal, however, remains unclear.

            <h>Talks 
            <p>Administration and congressional sources confirmed an April 25 Wall 
            Street Journal report that the United States sent an urgent 
            diplomatic message to allies earlier in the month notifying them of 
            U.S. concerns that North Korea might conduct a nuclear test. The 
            message also asked at least certain talks participants, such as 
            China and South Korea, to urge Pyongyang to refrain from provocative 
            behavior.

            <p>The other participants have been more supportive of engaging North 
            Korea than has the United States. Nevertheless, South Korean Foreign 
            Minster Ban Ki-moon warned North Korea against testing April 25, 
            stating that such an act would result in Pyongyang’s “isolation.”

            <p>The congressional source said the other countries would likely 
            follow suit, but perhaps not publicly.

            <p>Although conveying impatience with Pyongyang’s behavior, U.S. 
            officials continued to express support for the talks. Department of 
            State spokesperson Adam Ereli acknowledged April 25 that “the 
            stalemate has gone on…longer than any of us would have liked” but 
            “vehemently” denied that administration officials are “at the end of 
            our rope on this.”

            <p>In an April 28 news conference, President George W. Bush also 
            indicated continued U.S. support for the talks, adding that other 
            actions, such as involving the UN Security Council in the matter, 
            would depend on other participants’ support. China, which has veto 
            power on the Security Council, and South Korea have resisted asking 
            that body to take up the issue.

            <p>The duration of the current diplomatic track “is dependent upon our 
            consensus amongst ourselves,” Bush said.

            <p>For its part, North Korea continues to express a willingness to 
            return to the talks, albeit under certain conditions.

            <p>Pyongyang says it wants the United States to end its “hostile 
            policy” toward North Korea, express a willingness to accept peaceful 
            coexistence with the current regime, and retract Secretary of State 
            Condoleezza Rice’s reference to the government as one of several 
            “outposts of tyranny” during her January 2005 confirmation hearings. 
            (See ACT, April 2005.)

            <p>Perhaps significantly, North Korean officials have also hinted that 
            Pyongyang may change its stance on discussing its suspected 
            uranium-enrichment program. The congressional source, as well as a 
            witness to at least one such discussion, told Arms Control Today 
            that these officials have suggested to unofficial interlocutors 
            within the past several months that Pyongyang is willing to discuss 
            U.S. concerns about the program in private bilateral talks.

            <p>Suspicions that North Korea is pursuing the capability to enrich 
            uranium have played a central role in the current nuclear crisis. 
            The standoff began in October 2002 after a visiting U.S. delegation 
            accused Pyongyang of pursuing such a program covertly. North Korean 
            officials admitted as much, U.S. officials said later, but Pyongyang 
            has denied that it made such an admission. Highly enriched uranium 
            and plutonium are the two types of fissile materials used in nuclear 
            weapons.

            <p>The issue has also become a major point of contention in the 
            six-party talks. During the last round, the United States insisted 
            that North Korea disclose and dismantle the program, but the North 
            Korean delegation denied that it has such a program and refused to 
            discuss the matter. Pyongyang has not publicly changed this 
position.

            <p>The United States has said repeatedly that it will not engage North 
            Korea in bilateral negotiations, although it has met privately with 
            the North Koreans during the six-party talks. (See ACT, July/August 
            2004.)

            <h>Testing and Threats
            <p>According to the congressional source, the United States has 
            identified “about half a dozen” possible North Korean nuclear 
            testing sites and has recently seen “foggy” indications that 
            Pyongyang may be preparing to test. However, South Korea’s National 
            Security Adviser Kwon Jin-ho dismissed reports of such preparations 
            in an April 27 radio interview, stating that “no unusual [North 
            Korean] moves have been detected.”

            <p>Washington’s concerns stem mainly from Pyongyang’s recent 
            provocative statements, rather than any new intelligence, the 
            administration official said.

            <p>A March 31 North Korean Foreign Ministry statement describing the 
            country as a “full-fledged nuclear weapons state” is one such 
            example. Speaking to reporters April 27 in Beijing, Hill voiced 
            concern about what North Korea “might do to further demonstrate that 
            [status],” Reuters reported.

            <p>Hill’s warning came three days after North Korean Army Staff Chief 
            Kim Yong Chun further escalated the tension, stating that Pyongyang 
            will “steadily bolster its nuclear deterrent force,” according to 
            the state-run Korean Central News Agency.

            <p>The extent to which a nuclear test would advance North Korea’s 
            weapons capabilities is unclear. According to an August 2003 CIA 
            assessment, North Korea has “validated” designs for simple fission 
            nuclear weapons without conducting “yield-producing nuclear tests.”

            <p>U.S. officials are also concerned about a reported North Korean 
            threat to transfer nuclear weapons to terrorists. North Korea expert 
            Selig Harrison told reporters April 9 that, during a recent meeting, 
            Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gye Gwan said Pyongyang might give nuclear 
            weapons to terrorists if “the United States drives us into a 
corner.”

            <p>North Korea has previously implied that it would transfer nuclear 
            weapons to other countries, but Assistant Secretary of State for 
            Intelligence and Research (INR) Thomas Fingar told the Senate Select 
            Committee on Intelligence in February that “[t]here is no convincing 
            evidence that [North Korea] has ever sold, given, or even offered to 
            transfer such material to any state or nonstate actor.”

            <h>Reactor Shutdown
            Han Song Ryol, North Korea’s deputy ambassador to the UN, told USA 
            Today April 18 that North Korea had shut down its research reactor 
            at Yongbyon. Pyongyang plans to reprocess the spent fuel to produce 
            additional nuclear weapons, Han added.

            <p>South Korea has verified the reactor shutdown “through various 
            channels,” Foreign Affairs and Trade Ministry official Kim Sook told 
            the Korean Broadcasting System the same day.

            <p>Whether Pyongyang is in the process of producing additional 
            plutonium is unclear.

            <p>Stopping the reactor’s operation is necessary if North Korea is to 
            unload the reactor’s irradiated nuclear fuel rods. Spent nuclear 
            fuel can be “reprocessed” to separate plutonium from other elements 
            of those fuel rods, which can then be used as fissile material in 
            nuclear weapons. 

            <p>Despite Han’s boast, other observers are not certain that Pyongyang 
            intends either to unload or reprocess the fuel rods.

            <p>South Korea’s semi-official Yonhap News Agency quoted an unnamed 
            South Korean “senior government official” April 18 who contended 
            that North Korea suspended the reactor merely for “technical 
            reasons.” That official cautioned that this assessment could change, 
            the report said.

            <p>The U.S. assessment that North Korea has one or two weapons is 
            believed to have been based on estimates of the amount of plutonium 
            North Korea separated from spent fuel produced in the reactor prior 
            to a 1994 agreement with the United States. Whether Pyongyang has 
            since built weapons is unclear.

            <p>North Korea announced in December 2002 that it was restarting the 
            reactor, which, along with North Korea’s reprocessing facility and 
            approximately 8,000 spent fuel rods, had been frozen under the 1994 
            agreement. Later that month, North Korea ejected International 
            Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors charged with monitoring the 
            freeze. The United States announced in February 2003 that North 
            Korea had restarted the reactor.

            <p>Pyongyang’s announcement followed the escalation of bilateral 
            diplomatic tensions after the October 2002 meeting with the U.S. 
            delegation.

            <p>Pyongyang has since claimed to have reprocessed the spent fuel 
            previously subject to IAEA monitoring. That fuel would have 
            contained enough plutonium for “several more” nuclear weapons, 
            then-CIA director George Tenet told the Senate Intelligence 
            Committee in February 2004.

            <p>North Korea’s possible reprocessing likely formed the basis for 
            current CIA director Porter Goss’s February 2005 statement before 
            the same committee that Pyongyang’s “capability” to produce nuclear 
            weapons has “increased.” (See ACT, March 2005.)

            <p>South Korean Defense Minister Yoon Kwang-ung reportedly stated in 
            February, however, that North Korea has reprocessed “only part of 
            the spent fuel rods.” Siegfried Hecker, a senior fellow at the Los 
            Alamos National Laboratory, told the Senate Foreign Relations 
            Committee in January 2004 that the fuel rods were no longer in 
            storage when he visited North Korea earlier that year, but he could 
            not verify North Korea’s reprocessing claim. (See ACT, March 2005.)

            <p>A 2004 Congressional Research Service report stated that the fuel 
            rods currently in the reactor could yield enough plutonium for one 
            nuclear weapon annually.

            <p>Describing another possible danger of North Korea’s unfettered 
            nuclear program, a 2003 INR assessment indicates that North Korea is 
            more apt to export nuclear material as it produces more plutonium. 
            Pyongyang would be “most likely to export nuclear material if it has 
            more fissile material than it believes it needs for deterrent 
            purposes and if it perceives little risk” that such a transaction 
            would be detected, the assessment said.
