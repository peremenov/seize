                        (the goddess of wealth), holds an important place among

                        fortnight.

                        <p>The temple of Kaila Devi is located on the banks of the 
                        Kalisil river in the hills of Trikut, 2 kms. to the 
                        north-west of Kaila village. It houses the images of 
                        Mahalakshmi and Chamunda. Kaila Devi has been regarded 
                        as the guardian deity throughout the ages by the 
                        Khinchis, the Yadavas and the princess of Karauli.

                              <p>A small temple dedicated to Bhairon is situated in 
                              the courtyard and facing the shrine of Kaila Devi 
                              is a temple of Hanuman locally called 'Languriya'. 
                              Throughout the year, there is a steady flow of 
                              devotees to this spot but during the Kaila Devi 
                              Fair, the participants number as many as 2 lakhs. 
                              There is no restriction for members of any 
                              community to visit the fair or the shrine. A large 
                              number of pilgrims from Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, 
                              Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Delhi and Haryana visit 
                              the fair.


                        <h>WORSHIP & RITUALS
                        <p>The devotees bring with them cash, coconuts, kajal 
                        (kohl), tikki (vermilion), sweets and bangles as 
                        offerings to the goddess. 

                        <p>The ritual of Kanak-Dandoti is observed by the staunch 
                        devotees. They cover a distance of 15 to 20 kms. to 
                        reach the temple, not on foot but by lying prostrate, 
                        making lines with their hands in that position, 
                        advancing upto the line drawn and repeating this 
                        procedure till they reach the temple. While some eat 
                        food and take rest during the journey, others endure the 
                        rigours of the ritual without these.

                        <p>Successors of Goli Bhagat, who used to be a great 
                        devotee of Kaila Devi, come from Agra to carry out his 
                        tradition of paying homage at the shrine.

                        <h>TRADING & FESTIVITY
                        <p>The fair is visited by a large number of traders who set 
                        up their shops and sell a variety of indigenous 
                        products. Groups of Mina tribesmen arrive in a spirit of 
                        gaiety-dancing, singing and creating a lively 
                        atmosphere. The spacious courtyard becomes the venue for 
                        dances and songs sung in praise of the deities.
