      <p>Dec 2003



      <h>Background: 
      <p>TF operates an evening school for children. Most of the children come from 
      the surrounding areas and go to regular municipal schools. After they are 
      done with the regular schooling, they come to the TF operated school. In 
      some cases dropout children are coached for the open school exams. The 
      school operates from 5PM to 8PM and uses the premises one local municipal 
      school called the Dharamdas Trust Model School. TF has 36 staff including 
      21 teachers. They run classes for children from PP (preprimary) to the std 
      XII. There are fewer children in the higher classes but in the next couple 
      of years, there should be lot more. 

      <p>TF operates in an old part of the city - Kalighat. It is surrounded by 
      slums. There are a few thousand families in the area covered by this 
      organization. Most of the children come from poor families but some 
      mothers are prostitutes. 
      I visited a couple of slums - Sarat Bose and Masjid which I talk about 
      later in this report. 

      <p>TF believes in overall development of the child. The evening school is 
      place to (1) continue the formal learning (2) improve mental and physical 
      health, and (3) provide hope, vision and preparation for future for the 
      children, and (3) reaching out to the community through the children.

      <h>Summary
      <p>TF has been running a school for children from slums in Kolkata for the 
      past 10 years. Consistness and completeness is their objective. They have 
      shown considerable innovation w.r.t keeping the children motivated, 
      involving the community, and working with the local government. This visit 
      comes approximately 10 years after they started and while everything is 
      done as yet, it appears that they are pretty successful in their effort to 
      retain and motivate children. It is an interesting experiment, and throws 
      up many questions regarding the role of NGOs, government, parents and 
      education. 


      <h>Day 1: 

      <p>Reached Kalighat subway station at around 2PM. One of staff members, 
      Kaustub, came to pick me up from the station. The Tomorrow's Foundation 
      office was less than 10 min walk from the station. 

      <p>I was introduced all the staff there - 

      <l>Anitaji - External relations
      <l>Ashish Dey - Teaching 
      <l>Kasturi di - Counseling
      <l>Shiela - Home visit Cell 
      <l>Kaustub - Accounts
      <l>Chanchal - Assistant 
      <l>Arpan - Teacher and replacement coordinator when Ashish is not around. 

      <p>and later on 
      <l>Ashish Roy - Project Coordinator 
      <l>Tanushree Roy - Ex-home visit cell 

      <p>Totally there are 36 staff - who take one or more classes. Some come 
      during certain days of the week. 

      <p>There were a couple of folks who came in later from a local college who 
      were interning with TF. 

      <p>The office has three rooms one each for Mamoni and Ashish. Another for 
      rest of the staff (accounting, cells etc.) 

      <p>I gave an update on the sanctuary conference which happened that same week 
      in Mysore, and talked about Ashis's presentation there. 

      <p>Shortly after I reached office, children started flowing in. They hung 
      around for some time before going to the evening school run by Tomorrow's 
      Foundation at the local Dharamdas School. They recited poem and sang songs 
      for me. While I was there three girls from the open school (Std X) came 
      back after writing their history exam. They seem satisfied enough with 
      their performance but they hope to do better in the next couple of exams - 
      one of which is bengali and another is biology. Then I gave a short test 
      on geography and political map of india. They kept getting confused but 
      made progress. I gave them some simple tips on writing exams. 

      <p>An interesting thing happened: One of the girls wanted to come to US. I 
      asked why. She replied that she likes to watch WWF and if she comes to US 
      she can see WWF for real. I tried convincing them that the whole show is 
      scripted but they refused to believe it. Later Kasturi di (Counseling) 
      explained to me the significance of WWF. They saw the WWF fights give a 
      vent to aggression building up in them from within. Subtle but 
      unmistakable if you are looking for clues. 

      <p>I left for the school slightly after 5PM. By the time I reached, the 
      prayer was over and children were in their classes. I visited each class 
      starting from PP (pre-primary to 12th). In higher classes there were 
      relatively few students. I met some star candidades whose name I had only 
      heard of before. I went into each class and greeted everyone. Children 
      naturally welcomed from the interruption. Some of the classes were 
      preparing from exams or taking mocks. 

      <p>The PP and Standard I children were particularly excited. The standard I 
      children rushed towards me. Most wanted to shake hands with me and try 
      their latest technique for that involving the thumb and the little finger. 
      Some (embarrasingly) wanted to touch my feet - a local custom being 
      drilled into their minds. 

      <p>I spent almost 1 hour (one period) with Standard 4. I discussed India's 
      geography. They were quite eager to converse about anything and 
      everything, and asked many questions. They made me sing and one of them 
      also sang. It was the most fun part of my visit. 

      <p>Just before leaving one small girl gave me greeting card and ran away 
      before I realized. She drew a nice picture of a home with crayons and 
      wrote her name and class at the back. Cool! Apparently thats the 
      responsibility of Class I. 

      <p>Chanchal dropped me off at Ashish and Tanushree's place. We caught up on 
      the conference happenings. 


      <h>Day 2 

      <p>Visit to HWH Site: 

      <p>Day started with a visit to the Half Way Home construction site. (See the 
      pictures). The Half Way Home is a temporary shelter for children in need - 
      there are about 3-4 crisis situations everyweek. There was also a need to 
      consolidate TF activities. With support from Asha and others, they bought 
      some land in Kolkata suburbs near Ruby Hospital off a major highway. The 
      construction has begun in December. Half Way Home was one of the 
      benificiaries of the Asha WAH 2003 effort. 

      <p>The Half Way Home has been expanded since the original WAH proposal was 
      made - now it is a four storeyed building with an impressive design 
      contributed by an italian. It is about 20-30 min from the Goria (Ashish's 
      place) and also from Raash Beharee (where TF office is). The construction 
      workers were digging the plot - wet, clayey soil - to lay the foundation. 
      Since the place is away from the mainroad (bypass) and there is nothing 
      but a lake behind, it appears that the children of half way home can get 
      some space to play outside. Kalighat area is too crowded. There is a worry 
      about malaria because the lake has stagnant water - but that may not be a 
      new problem. there are ponds and mosquitos all over the place. 

      <p>Interestingly the local community, after coming to know about the 
      objective of the place, agitated against the construction. TF using some 
      local contacts were able to convince them. 

      <p>Office: 

      <p>Swarup dropped in to meet me. He updated me (along with Ashish and 
      Anitaji) about the finances - how the budget of the HWH has grown and how 
      they pooling in money to complete it. At a later point in time I talked to 
      Arup who was in Delhi. He talked about how the organization has grown and 
      how they are trying to keep it a consistent effort. I updated him about 
      the recently held sanctuary conference. I asked about the TF Card project 
      and future plans for them. 

      <p>The TF Card project is a vocational training center for the older 
      children. The products include cards, lamp shades, books etc. The revenue 
      of this center is around 2 lakhs which is sufficient to break even and 
      generate some profit. The main issue seems to (1) the high cost of the raw 
      material - because they buy in small quantities (2) the demands are 
      seasonal. 

      <p>There is a possibility that Asha can source material from TF - if we can 
      figure out how to make it happen. The key issue is the costs of transport. 


      <p>Harlett School: 

      <p>I paid a brief visit to Harlett school (a christian missionary school) 
      where a bunch of TF students were participating in the their (Harlett 
      School's) Christmas Day celebration. They were a few solos and a short 
      skit -- all with ease in front of a crowd of about 2-300 students. They 
      got a genuine and long applause. One girl in particular had a truely 
      wonderful voice. I wanted to meet her on Day 3 but she was absent. I met 
      her mother, though. She (mother) came to meet TF staff for some reason. 

      <p>Conseling Cell: 

      <p>I spent a couple of hours with Kasturi talking about the psychological 
      impact of TF environment on children. She discussed case studies of 
      various children and how they handle them. There are some key skills 
      required for this (1) figuring out when exactly something is wrong with a 
      child. they show up primarily in changed behavior. (2) talking to figure 
      out what exactly the problem is - everything from adolescence-related 
      issues to problems at home. This sometimes take multiple sessions - in one 
      case 20 sessions. Kasturi di also handles career counseling. There are a 
      couple of tests which atleast to a first approximation can tell us about 
      interests about the child. Sometimes a note is passed to the teachers 
      asking them to pay special attention to a particular child and teachers 
      comes back with observations. All these are documents are maintained in a 
      per-child folder. I got to see a few but did not have time to read the 
      notes in detail. 

      <p>Unstable families - domestic violence, drunkard father, broken homes, loss 
      of livelihood - are the key reasons for dropping out. Poor motivation and 
      lack of family interest add to it. Other issues such as poor documentation 
      (date of birth), lack of proper shelter esp. during rainy seasons also 
      contribute to the problem. 

      <p>There are standard (psychology) tests apparently give reasonably good 
      hints about the child - interests and mental state. 

      <p>The case load is higher during monsoon and during exams. 

      <p>Home Visit: 

      <p>I went along with Ashish and Shiela on a home visit to the surrounding 
      slums. I visited the slums of Sarat Bose and Masjid. The homes in Sarat 
      Bose are small but generally appear to be clean - no stink from open 
      drains. Masjid was more run down. This walk serves multiple purposes (1) 
      to figure out what the issue is with specific children who have not been 
      turning up at school (2) to urge children who get distracted with activity 
      on the street and forget about TF school, and (3) to identify children who 
      are not attending school. This appears to be quite effective. There were 
      only a couple houses with absentee children. This trip was short and there 
      didnt appear to be any outstanding issues (except with one child who's 
      uncle expired). 


      <p>School: 

      <p>I spent more than an hour with standard 6. Pinaki was incharge. He let me 
      spend time. I didnt have much problem with language. Many of the children 
      knew hindi. They like to sing and dance - something that I found they all 
      want to do all the time. They talked about many things including favorite 
      bollywood stars. Somewhere in the middle I mentioned about the personal 
      histories of a public figures. It really got them interested. They couldnt 
      believe that somebody could start small and do well. They repeatedly asked 
      me if it was true. I then realized how they have built mental limits for 
      themselves. I gave a pep talk on why it was possible, and the importance 
      of school and attending classes. One of them confessed about difficulties 
      that she was having with math. Another jumped in and confessed the same 
      about History. I spent the rest of class giving them tips on classes and 
      tried to motivate them about the various classes they take. 


      <h>Day 3

      <p>I spent the initial part of Day 3 (saturday) visiting another 
      organization, Sanlaap. I came back to the school for the evening classes. 

      <p>This was undoubtedly the most exciting day for the children - only 
      cultural activities were scheduled. There were yoga, drawing, singing, 
      dancing and drama classes. The children were free to choose whatever 
      interests them. The dance class is the clear winner by a huge margin. 
      Almost everyone wanted to be in it. The staff was very impressive. I spent 
      most of my time with the drama class though. The teacher was quite 
      accomplished, I believe, from National School of Drama. He has been with 
      TF with more than two years. When I entered his class, he was discussing 
      scenes from Shakespeare's Hamlet and enacting bits and pieces of it. Later 
      his discussed a little bit of Macbeth as well -- all to students who are 
      between 3 and 8th standards. I read Macbeth when I was in Class 12! The 
      class was preparing for the upcoming annual function on Jan 31. I asked 
      him what the story would be. He said he does know as yet. He plans to 
      "share his experiences with the children", and they will come up with 
      something _together_. The final drama might be a collage. He expressed 
      confidence in the children's abilities and creativity. The children 
      apparently have figured out the basic stage management, lighting and sound 
      principles. I would have loved to have such a teacher who gives so much 
      room for creativity of the children. I left with the comment that enacting 
      Macbeth, whatever be the length of the piece, in 5th standard can do 
      wonders to their confidence. 

      <p>I left the next day morning. 



      <h>TF Plans for Future

      <p>The primary focus right now is the Half Way Home. They are waiting for it 
      to be built so that they can settle down to think about newer initatives. 

      <p>Now the children are growing. A couple of years from now there will be 
      significantly more number of children in higher classes. A couple of 
      different plans are in the works (1) ways to give the older children 
      greater responsibility, independence and areas of operations - right in 
      the midst of the community - as a way to demonstrate the value of 
      education. (2) way to engage the children through vocational training 
      activities. 


      <h>Philosophical Aspects: 

      <p>I spent all three evenings with Ashish Roy talking about the philosophy 
      and operation of TF. 

      <h>1. What is TF's role

      <p>TF's role is encourage a change in mindset of people. Children - create 
      awareness of their rights. Parents- awareness about their 
      responsibilities, Local government - make them aware of their 
      responsibility to support institutions like TF. The key technique used was 
      to provide partial solution and motivate the parents/government to provide 
      the rest. If this meant delay and pain, so be it. 

      <h>2. Conduct of TF staff 

      <p>TF staff all wear bright clothes and always cheerful. The point is a 
      subtle one. It is to create a sense of liveliness and confidence - and 
      create the enthusiasm to attain that stage. 

      <p>A couple of the staff are products of TF. They provide effective role 
      models - always in front of them. 


      <p>4. General points to ponder upon (not specific TF but a result of a number 
      of discussions with people and visits to other organizations): 

      <p>(a) How do we ensure that for any given family, this generation is the 
      last one which require help? 

      <p>(b) NGOs have vested interest in sustaining the problem (e.g., a certain 
      number of derived children) because their livelihood depends on it. So 
      have to be careful while dealing with them. By using specific words (e.g., 
      devadasi) they may actually help keep the problem domain alive.
