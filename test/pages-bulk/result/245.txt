                              <h>Journalists got into the business because they 
                              love to tell stories, but do readers have the time 
                              to read them?
                              By Clark Hoyt
                              <p>I never said that long, windy stories are the only 
                              threats to newspapers. Sure, sensationalism, 
                              irrelevance, arrogance and bad ethics are threats. 
                              So, as Roy Peter Clark, a distinguished academic, 
                              says, are superficiality and boredom. Staff 
                              cutbacks? Shrinking newsholes? They may be more 
                              symptoms of newspapers’ ills, not the root 
                              causes of them.
                              <p>Other threats are increased competition from other 
                              media, a declining sense of community and changing 
                              lifestyles, including an ever faster pace that 
                              leaves people feeling they have less time to spend 
                              with a newspaper. 
                              And that brings us right back to long stories. 
                              <p>Clark says nobody can disagree with the premise 
                              that readers want sharply focused, tightly written 
                              pieces that get on and off the stage quickly. But 
                              then he argues against it. 
                              <p>Faced with the inconvenient fact that readers 
                              spend an average of no more than 15 minutes a day 
                              reading the newspaper, Clark introduces a clever 
                              replacement for the clock. Instead of real time, 
                              we now have something called ART, Approximate 
                              Reading Time. Unfortunately, the reader with only 
                              10 minutes to spend on the morning paper probably 
                              doesn’t care whether that monster narrative 
                              takes 30 real minutes to read or 30 approximate 
                              minutes. He doesn’t have either one. 
                              <p>In the end, Approximate Reading Time is just the 
                              latest way to rationalize our stubborn refusal to 
                              listen to readers, to respect what they are 
                              telling us and to act on it. Sure, there are long 
                              stories that are of such transcendent interest and 
                              written with such powerful skill that they justify 
                              their length. There are just far fewer of them 
                              than the number of long stories published every 
                              day in America’s newspapers. 
                              <p>Let’s face it, most of us got into this business 
                              because we love to tell stories. At 300 words, 
                              we’re just clearing our throats. Cut off a story 
                              at 500 words? That’s an insult to all the effort 
                              I’ve put into the reporting. 1,000 words? Well, 
                              that’s a start. I submit that this process is 
                              driven by internal journalistic needs, not by a 
                              concern for readers and what they want from us. 
                              <p>For readers’ sakes, we need to learn the fine 
                              art of telling stories quickly, with rapid-fire 
                              impact. The long, leisurely, slowly unfolding 
                              narrative is great for books and may work in some 
                              magazines. It’s usually deadly for daily 
                              newspapers. 
                              <p>As for that St. Petersburg Times story, clearly 
                              Clark and I don’t agree. I understood the 
                              context; it was made clear in the letter 
                              nominating the piece for an ASNE Writing Award. 
                              The defendant’s makeover should have been old 
                              news by the end of a 10-day trial. What readers 
                              needed on the morning after the verdict was a 
                              story explaining why and how the jurors decided on 
                              their compromise verdict. This story never even 
                              addressed those questions. 
                              <p>Clark mocks criticism of long stories by asking 
                              where are the protesters marching in the streets. 
                              The protesters are the tens of thousands of former 
                              newspaper readers who have dropped their 
                              subscriptions and the countless others, many of 
                              them young and affluent, who haven’t started 
                              subscribing. Why? “No time to read,” they tell 
                              us. The circulation slide is now most pronounced 
                              on Sunday, the day we reserve for the very longest 
                              of our long stories. 
                              <p>Instead of arguing for stories with long narrative 
                              arcs, we need to be celebrating more excellent 
                              stories that pack in information with great 
                              economy, stories that are (dare I say it?) short.
