                  <p>Using a telescope 
                  <p>Now that you've bought a telescope, here are some ideas about 
                  what to start observing.
                  <p>Michael E. Bakich
                        <p>Congratulations. You've purchased a telescope. What now? 
                        You don't know what to look at? Welcome to the beginning 
                        of your journey as an amateur astronomer. 

                               
                              <p>The Moon is an easy target for beginning 
                              observers. NASA / USGS [larger image] 
                        <p>Start with the bright stuff
                        <p>I've been observing for many years, yet I still look at 
                        Jupiter and the Moon as often as I ever did. The Moon 
                        has so many features and details that if you observed it 
                        each possible night for the next decade, you wouldn't 
                        see everything. There's an added benefit to looking at 
                        brighter objects when you're first starting out — 
                        they're easier to find.

                        <p>Read about observing
                        <p>Many observing guidebooks exist to help you tour the 
                        sky's best celestial objects. In addition, each month, 
                        Astronomy magazine presents a section entitled "The sky 
                        this month." Individual features about that month's 
                        astronomy highlights (such as eclipses), the planets, 
                        deep-sky observing, meteor showers, comets, and 
                        asteroids will provide you with plenty of ideas about 
                        what to observe. Ongoing (but not monthly) features such 
                        as "Moon observer's notebook" and "A deep-sky year" 
                        provide additional projects that go into a bit more 
                        depth for beginning observers.

                        <p>Scan the Milky Way
                        <p>One of the most pleasurable observing experiences you 
                        can have under the summer or winter sky is simply 
                        scanning the Milky Way with your telescope. It's so 
                        simple — just shut down your laptop, ignore your 
                        observing guides, and turn off your go-to drive.

                        <p>Obtain a solar filter
                        <p>You can double your potential observing time if you 
                        purchase a quality solar filter and observe the Sun. You 
                        must be very careful when observing the Sun. Never look 
                        directly at the Sun with the naked eye or with any 
                        unfiltered optical instrument, and always cover your 
                        finder when observing the Sun. That being said, there 
                        are a number of safe ways to observe the Sun. 

                        <p>A filter that fits over the objective of the telescope 
                        is called a pre-filter. If you use a pre-filter, be 
                        absolutely certain it cannot be dislodged accidentally 
                        by the wind or by being bumped. If you are in doubt, 
                        securely tape the side flange of the filter to the 
                        telescope tube. When I construct a mounting cell for a 
                        solar pre-filter, I always include a large thumb screw 
                        that secures the cell to the tube.

                        <p>Start your solar observing by counting sunspots. Apart 
                        from being fun, sunspot counts provide a gauge of solar 
                        activity. Numbers of sunspots have been recorded on a 
                        daily basis since the middle of the 18th century. 
                        Sunspot observations can be quite different day to day 
                        because of different atmospheric conditions.

                        <p>Observe the Moon
                        <p>The Moon is a brilliant object when viewed through a 
                        telescope. You actually may want to use a neutral 
                        density filter to reduce the Moon's light. A better 
                        method is to do what many observers do to help them 
                        observe the Moon in comfort: Turn on nearby white lights 
                        when you're observing the Moon between First Quarter and 
                        Full. The addition of white lights suppresses the eyes' 
                        tendency to dark adapt at night and, in fact, causes the 
                        eye to use normal (scotopic) vision, which is of much 
                        higher quality than dark-adapted (photopic) vision.

                        <p>Of the 1,940 named features on the Moon, 1,545 (nearly 
                        80 percent) are craters. There are many more craters in 
                        the highlands than in the maria. The size range of 
                        craters is large, and some observers make it a personal 
                        challenge to see either (1) how small a crater they can 
                        see, or (2) how many small craters in a given area they 
                        can observe with a particular telescope. A detailed map 
                        of the Moon is, of course, a necessity for a project of 
                        this type.

                        <p>When observing larger craters, note whether you can see 
                        "rays" emanating from them. These features were formed 
                        when crushed rock sprayed out from a meteor impact. They 
                        form streaks in a radial pattern, which can be a great 
                        distance from the crater itself.

                              Ganymede next to its host planet, Jupiter, on 
                              December 3, 2000. NASA / JPL / University of 
                              Arizona [larger image] 
                        <p>Observe Jupiter
                        <p>Next to the Sun and Moon, the celestial object with the 
                        greatest detail is Jupiter. Even small telescopes will 
                        show Jupiter's four largest satellites. They appear as 
                        bright stars on either side of Jupiter and are generally 
                        in a straight line (although some interesting triangles 
                        and other forms are possible).

                        <p>In addition to the moons, several dark stripes can 
                        easily be seen on the planet. These stripes, on either 
                        side of the equator, are known as the North and South 
                        Equatorial Belts. With larger telescopes operating at 
                        greater magnifications, more belts are visible.

                        <p>At higher magnification, you can see that Jupiter is 
                        flattened, a result of its rapid rotation rate coupled 
                        with the fact that it is not a solid planet. Jupiter's 
                        equatorial diameter is more than 5,000 miles larger than 
                        its polar diameter.

                        <p>Watching Jupiter night after night can be a rewarding 
                        pursuit. In addition to the changing positions of its 
                        moons, the planet's rapid rotation brings nearly all of 
                        its visible area into view in a single night. At times, 
                        individual belts and zones become more or less 
                        prominent. Some have even disappeared for extended 
                        periods of time.

                        <p>All observers should use filters to bring out fainter 
                        detail not visualized in integrated (white) light. A 
                        blue (e.g., Wratten 38A) filter will enhance the dark 
                        reddish-brown belts over the planet. A red (e.g., 
                        Wratten 23A) filter will bring out the blue features 
                        (festoons) within the Equatorial Zone (EZ) of Jupiter as 
                        well as the northern and southern borders of the major 
                        belts.

                        <p>Jupiter is a great object to sketch. Sketching will make 
                        you a better observer because you'll study small areas 
                        more intently. Two words of caution when sketching 
                        Jupiter: Draw quickly! Jupiter rotates quite rapidly, 
                        and some of the features you'll be sketching may rotate 
                        out of view if you take longer than about 20 minutes. 
                        Sketch the positions of the equatorial belts and polar 
                        regions first. Carefully estimate their widths and 
                        extent and where, in terms of latitude, they begin and 
                        end. Next, place the less apparent belts and zones on 
                        your sketch as they appear on the planet. Work on one 
                        hemisphere at a time. Next, place features within the 
                        belts and zones using Jupiter's central meridian (an 
                        imaginary line from top to bottom) to help you gauge the 
                        distances. Finally, carefully shade your sketch to 
                        duplicate what you see. One technique some observers say 
                        works to bring out additional detail on Jupiter is to 
                        focus the eye on a spot halfway between one of the poles 
                        and the equator — but don't actually look at the spot. 
                        Concentrate on seeing and sketching detail in the polar 
                        area. Repeat for the other hemisphere.

                               
                              <p>The beautiful double star Albireo is in Cygnus the

                        <p>Observe double stars
                        <p>Astronomers estimate that 60 percent of all the stars in 
                        the Milky Way Galaxy are double or multiple stars. These 
                        stars appear as one to the unaided eye, but many may be 
                        resolved into pairs with the help of a telescope. I 
                        don't think there's an amateur astronomer I know who 
                        doesn't enjoy observing double stars. It's fun, easy, 
                        rewarding, doesn't take a complicated setup, you can 
                        observe from within a city, and challenging objects 
                        exist for every size of telescope.

                        <p>In addition to where the double star is in the sky and 
                        how bright each component is, there are two quantities 
                        with which a double star observer should be familiar. 
                        The first is the "separation" of the pair. This number 
                        is given in arcseconds, and it is simply the distance 
                        between the two stars. The second quantity is the 
                        "position angle." This is the angle, measured from north 
                        through east, of the fainter of the pair (the 
                        "companion," or "secondary") from the brighter (the 
                        "primary"). For instance, if the companion is due north 
                        of the primary, its position angle is 0°. If it is due 
                        east, 90°, and if midway between south and west, 225°.

                        <p>To determine the directions in your field of view, just 
                        let the stars drift for a while. If your telescope has a 
                        motor drive, turn it off for this check. The stars will 
                        enter the field of view from the east and exit to the 
                        west. Determine the longest path for the stars you see 
                        drifting through the field. This is your east-west line. 
                        The north-south line is perpendicular to it, and to find 
                        it, turn the drive back on, center a reasonably bright 
                        star, release the declination lock on your drive, and 
                        move the telescope by hand toward the north. As you 
                        observe the field of view, the bright star will be 
                        heading out, toward the south. Reverse this if you are 
                        located in the Southern Hemisphere. The technique is 
                        only slightly more complicated if you own a telescope on 
                        an alt-azimuth mount. To move this type of telescope 
                        "north," you have to adjust the altitude and azimuth 
                        motions simultaneously.

                        <p>The size of your telescope will influence which double 
                        stars you observe. The resolution of a telescope only 
                        depends on its size. Double star observers often refer 
                        to a rule of thumb called "Dawes Limit." The formula for 
                        Dawes Limit is r = 4.56/D, where r is the separation (in 
                        arcseconds) of the closest resolvable double star, and D 
                        is the diameter of the objective in inches. Alternately, 
                        you can use r = 114/D, where D is the diameter of the 
                        objective in millimeters. And remember, Dawes Limit is 
                        only a guideline.

                        <p>One reason for the popularity of double stars is that 
                        many of them show color. Colorful double stars are a joy 
                        to behold. It does take some time at the telescope 
                        before you begin to see colors easily, but the payoff is 
                        big. Close double stars often help us see color. The 
                        contrast between two or more stars in close proximity 
                        brings out subtle color tones that normally would be 
                        lost if each was viewed separately.

                        <p>Some of the enjoyment in amateur astronomy is in sharing 
                        observations with friends. You will find, however, that 
                        color perception at the eyepiece is about as personal 
                        and subjective as any phase of our hobby. Colors that 
                        you see apply to your eyes, period. Consider the 
                        following example. Once, at an observing session, my 
                        friend Steve Coe of the Saguaro Astronomy Club of 
                        Phoenix, Arizona, mentioned that he saw the double star 
                        107 Aqr as white and light green. His friend Gerry 
                        Rattley immediately stepped to the eyepiece and, after a 
                        moment, asked, "Which star are you calling green, the 
                        orange one?"

                              Large Telescope captured this image of the 
                              nebula's center. European Southern Observatory

                        <p>Observe Messier's list
                        <p>Charles Messier (1730 - 1817) was a French comet hunter. 
                        In his searches, he occasionally encountered celestial 
                        objects that had the appearance of comets. These objects 
                        appeared fuzzy in his small telescope but did not move 
                        against the background of stars. The astronomers of the 
                        day called these objects "nebulae, " a word whose 
                        definition is much more specific today.

                        <p>During his searches, he discovered a comet-like patch in 
                        Taurus on August 28, 1758. This non-moving object later 
                        became the first entry — M1 — in his famous catalog of 
                        nebulous objects that might be mistaken for comets. 
                        Messier published three versions of this catalog. The 
                        final tally of objects amounts to 110 and is the catalog 
                        we recognize today. For more about Messier and the 
                        objects in his catalog, I suggest reading Messier's 
                        Nebulae & Star Clusters by Kenneth Glyn Jones (Cambridge 
                        University Press, New York, second edition, 1991).

                        <p>Working your way through Messier's list will introduce 
                        you to some of the brightest deep-sky objects in the 
                        sky. You'll also learn about several types of deep-sky 
                        objects: star clusters, nebulae, and galaxies. 

                        <p>If you've seen all, most, or even just a few of the 
                        Messier objects, it may be time for you to participate 
                        in a Messier marathon — trying to see as many Messier 
                        objects as you can in a single night. I remember 
                        participating in Messier marathons in the early 1970s. 
                        In 1974, from the reasonably well-lit campus of the Ohio 
                        State University in Columbus, Ohio, a friend and I 
                        logged 106 Messier objects in one night using his 6-inch 
                        Newtonian reflector. Since then, I've seen all 110 in 
                        one night more than a dozen times.

                        <p>But the number of nights on which you can see all the 
                        Messier objects is limited due to the way the objects 
                        are distributed around the sky. Tom Polakis, an Arizona 
                        amateur astronomer and Astronomy contributing editor, 
                        has calculated the window of opportunity for a complete 
                        Messier marathon. Polakis's numbers are for 33° north 
                        latitude, and they get more favorable as you work your 
                        way south. The beginning of the season is about March 
                        17. The Messier marathon season ends on April 3. 
                        Remember, however, that you can't just go out and 
                        observe the Messier objects on all those dates. The 
                        second limiting factor is the Moon. Its phase must be 
                        within a day or so of New Moon.

                        <p>Can you see them all in one night? The quick answer is 
                        "yes." Many people have viewed all the Messier objects 
                        during a single night. All the Messier objects can be 
                        seen from a dark site on a good night With a good 3-inch 
                        telescope. I even have done the marathon with 
                        high-quality 7x50 binoculars. On March 4/5, 2000, under 
                        a partly cloudy sky, I saw 75 Messier objects, and I 
                        believe 90 is a strong possibility with good weather.
