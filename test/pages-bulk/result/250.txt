          <l>The Use of Storytelling in the Department of the Navy (local copy) 
            <p>Conveying information in a story provides a rich context, remaining 
            in the conscious memory longer and creating more memory traces than 
            information not in context. Therefore a story is more likely to be 
            acted upon than normal means of communications. Storytelling, 
            whether in a personal or organizational setting, connects people, 
            develops creativity, and increases confidence. The use of stories in 
            organizations can build descriptive capabilities, increase 
            organizational learning, convey complex meaning, and communicate 
            common values and rule sets. 
            <p>Description capabilities are essential in strategic thinking and 
            planning, and create a greater awareness of what we could achieve. 
            Fictional stories can be powerful because they provide a mechanism 
            by which an organization can learn from failure without attributing 
            blame. 
            <p>With the advent of the Internet and Intranet, there is a larger 
            opportunity to use stories to bring about change. Electronic media 
            adds moving images and sound as context setters. Hypertext 
            capabilities and collaboration software invites groups, teams and 
            communities to co-create their stories. New multiprocessing skills 
            are required to navigate this new world, skills that include the 
            quick and sure assimilation of and response to fast-flowing images 
            and sounds and sensory assaults. 
            <p>In summary, when used well storytelling is a powerful 
            transformational tool in organizations, one that all of our managers 
            and leaders across the Department need to utilize.

          <p>by Zsambok, Beach, and Klein, for Naval 
          Command, Control and Ocean Surveillance Center, Dec 1992 
            <p>According to the theory, the story coordinates three types of 
            knowledge: 
              <p>facts or information from the current situation 
              <p>knowledge about similar situations 
              <p>generic expectations about what makes a complete story, such as 
              believing that people do what they do for a reason 
            <p>Given a set of known facts in an unfolding situation, knowledge 
            about similar situations, and expectations about what is needed to 
            make a complete story, the decisionmaker can know when important 
            information is missing, and where inferences must be made.

          coach Robert McKee, 
          <p>abstract with PubMed, at National Library of 
          Medicine 
            <p>In this conversation with HBR, Robert McKee, the world's best-known 
            screenwriting lecturer, argues that executives can engage people in 
            a much deeper--and ultimately more convincing--way if they toss out 
            their Power-Point slides and memos and learn to tell good stories. 
            As human beings, we make sense of our experiences through stories. 
            But becoming a good storyteller is hard. It requires imagination and 
            an understanding of what makes a story worth telling. All great 
            stories deal with the conflict between subjective expectations and 
            an uncooperative objective reality.

           <p>Ten Commandments of Good Listening - as posted by the Wildland Fire 
          Leadership Development Program 
            <p>the first ten - from K. Davis, Human Behavior at Work, McGraw Hill, 
            1972 
              <p>Stop talking. Obvious, but not easy. 
              <p>Put the speaker at ease. Create a permissive, supportive climate 
              in which the speaker will feel free to express himself or herself. 

              <p>Show a desire to listen. Act interested and mean it. 
              <p>Remove distractions. External preoccupation is less likely if 
              nothing external is present to preoccupy you. 
              <p>Empathize. Try to experience to some degree the feelings the 
              speaker is experiencing. 
              <p>Be patient. Give the speaker time to finish; don't interrupt. 
              <p>Hold your temper. Don't let your emotions obstruct your thoughts. 
              <p>Go easy on argument and criticism. Suspend judgment. 
              <p>Ask questions. If things are still unclear when a speaker has 
              finished, ask questions which serve to clarify the intended 
              meanings. 
              <p>Stop talking. In case you missed the first commandment. 
            <p>additional listening techniques - from P. Bradley and J. Baird, 
            Communication for Business and the Professions, Brown, 1980 
              <p>Preparation. If you know what the topic is ahead of time, learn 
              something about it so you will not be an ignorant listener. Even 
              some careful thinking will allow you to listen more accurately 
              when the communication actually begins. 
              <p>Seek intent. Try to discover the intent of the source; why is he 
              or she saying these things? 
              <p>Seek structure. Look for an organizational scheme of the message. 
              If the speaker is an accomplished one, you won't have to look very 
              hard; it will be obvious. But if the speaker is less skilled, the 
              responsibility falls to you. 
              <p>Analyze. Do not accept what you hear at face value; analyze what 
              the speaker is saying and pay attention to body language. 
              <p>Focus. Keep the main topic of the message in mind at all times, 
              using it to bring focus to the information which the speaker 
              supplies. 
              <p>Motivate yourself. This may be the most important. Listening takes 
              work, and to do that you may have to "psych yourself up."

             <p>from NTSB - relies more 
            on lengthy narrative responses 
              <p>The traditional interviewer asks many questions, each of which 
              elicits a very brief response. The cognitive interview, on the 
              other hand, is in some ways a questionless interview. The goal is 
              to ask as few questions as possible so that witnesses give you 
              long narrative responses that each contains that much more 
              information than a traditional interview. The objective is to try 
              to elicit information, not extract information. The good 
              interviewer tries to create a social environment so the witness 
              generates information without having to wait for questions to be 
              asked.

            (local copy), 
            <p>by Artwohl, in Law Enforcement Bulletin, Oct 2002 
              <p>The developers of this method found that how investigators 
              interview individuals can significantly impact the ability of the 
              witnesses to remember and report the details of an event. Their 
              research indicated the cognitive interview as the most effective 
              technique for facilitating memory retrieval with cooperative 
              witnesses. Using proper interview techniques is particularly 
              important for high-stress situations because during experiential 
              thinking, the individual is more likely to be dissociative and 
              “encodes reality in concrete images, metaphors, and narratives,” 
              whereas, in rational thinking, the individual is more logical and 
              “encodes reality in abstract symbols, words, and numbers.” 
            <p>As cognitive interviewing involves thinking aloud on the part of the 
            interviewee, one should keep in mind the following item (which may 
            also apply to cultures other than Asian) from 
              <p>The Geography of Thought: How Asians and Westerners Think 
              Differently… and Why, by Richard Nisbett, 2003 
                <p>To test the possibility that Asians and Asian Americans in fact 
                find it relatively difficult to use language to represent

          <l>FM 34-52 Intelligence Interrogation, 
          <p>1992 version 
          <p>NOTE: some sources believe the 1987 version below was more permissive 
          than the 1992 version above - however, even in the 1987 version below 
          you can see the prohibition against force. 
          <l>Principles of Interrogation, 
          <p>in Chapter 1, FM 34-52 (1987 version, now 
          superceded) - included the following 
            <p>Interrogation is the art of questioning and examining a source to 
            obtain the maximum amount of usable information. The goal of any 
            interrogation is to obtain usable and reliable information, in a 
            lawful manner and in the least amount of time, which meets 
            intelligence requirements of any echelon of command. 
            ... 
            <p>The use of force, mental torture, threats, insults, or exposure to 
            unpleasant and inhumane treatment of any kind is prohibited by law 
            and is neither authorized nor condoned by the US Government. 
            Experience indicates that the use of force is not necessary to gain 
            the cooperation of sources for interrogation. Therefore, the use of 
            force is a poor technique, as it yields unreliable results, may 
            damage subsequent collection efforts, and can induce the source to 
            say whatever he thinks the interrogator wants to hear. However, the 
            use of force is not to be confused with psychological ploys, verbal 
            trickery, or other nonviolent and noncoercive ruses used by the 
            interrogator in questioning hesitant or uncooperative sources. 
            <p>The psychological techniques and principles outlined should neither 
            be confused with, nor construed to be synonymous with, unauthorized 
            techniques such as brainwashing, mental torture, or any other form 
            of mental coercion to include drugs. These techniques and principles 
            are intended to serve as guides in obtaining the willing cooperation 
            of a source. The absence of threats in interrogation is intentional, 
            as their enforcement and use normally constitute violations of 
            international law and may result in prosecution under the UCMJ. 
            <p>Additionally, the inability to carry out a threat of violence or 
            force renders an interrogator ineffective should the source 
            challenge the threat. Consequently, from both legal and moral 
            viewpoints, the restrictions established by international law, 
            agreements, and customs render threats of force, violence, and 
            deprivation useless as interrogation techniques.

              <p>Discover Magazine [Jan 2005 issue] reports Ekman is working with 
              the Department of Defense on software that could detect liars by 
              studying facial emotions, called micro-expressions, that go 
              unnoticed by the untrained eye. 
              <p>"They look just like an ordinary expression, except they're only 
              on the face about a 25th of a second," this researcher observes. 
              Ekman has shown that certain emotions flash almost undetectably 
              when people are telling high-stakes lies, where they benefit or 
              lose a lot.

            <p>Never use the passive where you can use the active. 
            <p>Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if 
            you can think of an everyday English equivalent.

          <l>The Use of Storytelling in the Department of the Navy (local copy) 
            <p>Conveying information in a story provides a rich context, remaining 
            in the conscious memory longer and creating more memory traces than 
            information not in context. Therefore a story is more likely to be 
            acted upon than normal means of communications. Storytelling, 
            whether in a personal or organizational setting, connects people, 
            develops creativity, and increases confidence. The use of stories in 
            organizations can build descriptive capabilities, increase 
            organizational learning, convey complex meaning, and communicate 
            common values and rule sets. 
            <p>Description capabilities are essential in strategic thinking and 
            planning, and create a greater awareness of what we could achieve. 
            Fictional stories can be powerful because they provide a mechanism 
            by which an organization can learn from failure without attributing 
            blame. 
            <p>With the advent of the Internet and Intranet, there is a larger 
            opportunity to use stories to bring about change. Electronic media 
            adds moving images and sound as context setters. Hypertext 
            capabilities and collaboration software invites groups, teams and 
            communities to co-create their stories. New multiprocessing skills 
            are required to navigate this new world, skills that include the 
            quick and sure assimilation of and response to fast-flowing images 
            and sounds and sensory assaults. 
            <p>In summary, when used well storytelling is a powerful 
            transformational tool in organizations, one that all of our managers 
            and leaders across the Department need to utilize.

            <p>According to the theory, the story coordinates three types of

            about similar situations, and expectations about what is needed to 
            make a complete story, the decisionmaker can know when important 
            information is missing, and where inferences must be made.

            <p>In this conversation with HBR, Robert McKee, the world's best-known 
            screenwriting lecturer, argues that executives can engage people in 
            a much deeper--and ultimately more convincing--way if they toss out 
            their Power-Point slides and memos and learn to tell good stories. 
            As human beings, we make sense of our experiences through stories. 
            But becoming a good storyteller is hard. It requires imagination and 
            an understanding of what makes a story worth telling. All great 
            stories deal with the conflict between subjective expectations and 
            an uncooperative objective reality.

           <p>Ten Commandments of Good Listening - as posted by the Wildland Fire 
          Leadership Development Program 
            <p>the first ten - from K. Davis, Human Behavior at Work, McGraw Hill, 
            1972 
              <p>Stop talking. Obvious, but not easy. 
              <p>Put the speaker at ease. Create a permissive, supportive climate 
              in which the speaker will feel free to express himself or herself. 

              <p>Show a desire to listen. Act interested and mean it. 
              <p>Remove distractions. External preoccupation is less likely if 
              nothing external is present to preoccupy you. 
              <p>Empathize. Try to experience to some degree the feelings the 
              speaker is experiencing. 
              <p>Be patient. Give the speaker time to finish; don't interrupt. 
              <p>Hold your temper. Don't let your emotions obstruct your thoughts. 
              <p>Go easy on argument and criticism. Suspend judgment. 
              <p>Ask questions. If things are still unclear when a speaker has 
              finished, ask questions which serve to clarify the intended 
              meanings. 
              <p>Stop talking. In case you missed the first commandment. 
            <p>additional listening techniques - from P. Bradley and J. Baird, 
            Communication for Business and the Professions, Brown, 1980 
              <p>Preparation. If you know what the topic is ahead of time, learn 
              something about it so you will not be an ignorant listener. Even 
              some careful thinking will allow you to listen more accurately 
              when the communication actually begins. 
              <p>Seek intent. Try to discover the intent of the source; why is he 
              or she saying these things? 
              <p>Seek structure. Look for an organizational scheme of the message. 
              If the speaker is an accomplished one, you won't have to look very 
              hard; it will be obvious. But if the speaker is less skilled, the 
              responsibility falls to you. 
              <p>Analyze. Do not accept what you hear at face value; analyze what 
              the speaker is saying and pay attention to body language. 
              <p>Focus. Keep the main topic of the message in mind at all times, 
              using it to bring focus to the information which the speaker 
              supplies. 
              <p>Motivate yourself. This may be the most important. Listening takes 
              work, and to do that you may have to "psych yourself up."

             <p>from NTSB - relies more 
            on lengthy narrative responses 
              <p>The traditional interviewer asks many questions, each of which 
              elicits a very brief response. The cognitive interview, on the 
              other hand, is in some ways a questionless interview. The goal is 
              to ask as few questions as possible so that witnesses give you 
              long narrative responses that each contains that much more 
              information than a traditional interview. The objective is to try 
              to elicit information, not extract information. The good 
              interviewer tries to create a social environment so the witness 
              generates information without having to wait for questions to be 
              asked.

            (local copy), 
            <p>by Artwohl, in Law Enforcement Bulletin, Oct 2002 
              <p>The developers of this method found that how investigators 
              interview individuals can significantly impact the ability of the 
              witnesses to remember and report the details of an event. Their 
              research indicated the cognitive interview as the most effective 
              technique for facilitating memory retrieval with cooperative 
              witnesses. Using proper interview techniques is particularly 
              important for high-stress situations because during experiential 
              thinking, the individual is more likely to be dissociative and 
              “encodes reality in concrete images, metaphors, and narratives,” 
              whereas, in rational thinking, the individual is more logical and 
              “encodes reality in abstract symbols, words, and numbers.” 
            <p>As cognitive interviewing involves thinking aloud on the part of the 
            interviewee, one should keep in mind the following item (which may 
            also apply to cultures other than Asian) from 
              <p>The Geography of Thought: How Asians and Westerners Think 
              Differently… and Why, by Richard Nisbett, 2003 
                <p>To test the possibility that Asians and Asian Americans in fact 
                find it relatively difficult to use language to represent 
                thought, Kim had people speak out loud as they solved various 
                kinds of problems. This had no effect on the performance of 
                European Americans. But the requirement to speak out loud had 
                very deleterious effects on the performance of Asians and Asian 
                Americans.

          <l>FM 34-52 Intelligence Interrogation, 
          <p>1992 version 
          <p>NOTE: some sources believe the 1987 version below was more permissive 
          than the 1992 version above - however, even in the 1987 version below 
          you can see the prohibition against force. 
          <l>Principles of Interrogation, 
          <p>in Chapter 1, FM 34-52 (1987 version, now 
          superceded) - included the following 
            <p>Interrogation is the art of questioning and examining a source to 
            obtain the maximum amount of usable information. The goal of any 
            interrogation is to obtain usable and reliable information, in a 
            lawful manner and in the least amount of time, which meets 
            intelligence requirements of any echelon of command. 
            ... 
            <p>The use of force, mental torture, threats, insults, or exposure to 
            unpleasant and inhumane treatment of any kind is prohibited by law 
            and is neither authorized nor condoned by the US Government. 
            Experience indicates that the use of force is not necessary to gain 
            the cooperation of sources for interrogation. Therefore, the use of 
            force is a poor technique, as it yields unreliable results, may 
            damage subsequent collection efforts, and can induce the source to 
            say whatever he thinks the interrogator wants to hear. However, the 
            use of force is not to be confused with psychological ploys, verbal 
            trickery, or other nonviolent and noncoercive ruses used by the 
            interrogator in questioning hesitant or uncooperative sources. 
            <p>The psychological techniques and principles outlined should neither 
            be confused with, nor construed to be synonymous with, unauthorized 
            techniques such as brainwashing, mental torture, or any other form 
            of mental coercion to include drugs. These techniques and principles 
            are intended to serve as guides in obtaining the willing cooperation 
            of a source. The absence of threats in interrogation is intentional, 
            as their enforcement and use normally constitute violations of 
            international law and may result in prosecution under the UCMJ. 
            <p>Additionally, the inability to carry out a threat of violence or 
            force renders an interrogator ineffective should the source 
            challenge the threat. Consequently, from both legal and moral 
            viewpoints, the restrictions established by international law, 
            agreements, and customs render threats of force, violence, and 
            deprivation useless as interrogation techniques.

              the Department of Defense on software that could detect liars by 
              studying facial emotions, called micro-expressions, that go 
              unnoticed by the untrained eye. 
              <p>"They look just like an ordinary expression, except they're only 
              on the face about a 25th of a second," this researcher observes. 
              Ekman has shown that certain emotions flash almost undetectably 
              when people are telling high-stakes lies, where they benefit or 
              lose a lot.

            <p>Never use the passive where you can use the active. 
            <p>Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if 
            you can think of an everyday English equivalent. 
            <p>Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright

		  <p>NIH 
          summary of study by Newstead et al, Department of Psychology, 
          University of Plymouth, UK 
            <p>In studies of the belief bias effect in syllogistic reasoning, an 
            interaction between logical validity and the believability of the 
            conclusion has been found; in essence, logic has a larger effect on 
            unbelievable than on believable conclusions. Two main explanations 
            have been proposed for this finding. The selective scrutiny account 
            claims that people focus on the conclusion and only engage in 
            logical processing if this is found to be unbelievable; while the 
            misinterpreted necessity account claims that subjects misunderstand 
            what is meant by logical necessity and respond on the basis of 
            believability when indeterminate syllogisms are presented. ... [five 
            experiments were run] ... It is concluded that people try to 
            construct a mental model of the premises but, if there is a 
            believable conclusion consistent with the first model they produce, 
            then they fail to construct alternative models.

            <p>Meet your listeners at their level of understanding. Use metaphors: 
            Compare unfamiliar facts with something simple the audience already 
            knows. An example would be comparing the flow of water in a pipe 
            with the flow of electricity in a wire. People learn more rapidly 
            when the information relates to their own experience.

            <p>Uses metaphors to describe organizational relations. Includes quote 
            below. 
            <p>"Metaphor is often regarded just as a device for embellishing 
            discourse, but its significance is much greater than this. The use 
            of metaphor implies a way of thinking and a way of seeing that 
            pervade how we understand our world generally. . . . Metaphor is 
            inherently paradoxical. It can create powerful insights that also 
            become distortions, as the way of seeing created through a metaphor 
            becomes a way of not seeing." - from Gareth Morgan, Images of 
            Organization, 2d ed. (Thousand Oaks, Calif.: Sage Publications, 
            1997), 4-5. 
          <l>The Digital General: Reflections on Leadership in the Post-Information 
          Age, 
		  <p>by Harig, in Parameters, Autumn 1996 
            <p>Just as there are plentiful examples where critical scientific 
            breakthroughs have occurred while the right brain (our intuitive, 
            pre-verbal cognitive resource) was operating ahead of the pack, 
            strategic vision requires an ability to think in metaphors, to seek 
            related patterns in unrelated objects, situations, and events. True, 
            our future senior leaders will have access to more information. The 
            successful ones will be those who are best able to sort out the 
            important from the interesting. The development and testing of 
            analogies--the patterns that allow leaders to see the important 
            under data overload, is a skill that could waste away under a 
            sterile diet of expert systems and virtual reality simulations.
