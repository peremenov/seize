<h>How to run a group discussion

<h>5. Hold the discussions
<p>Each group needs a discussion leader, or moderator. This person (preferably not 
a radio or TV presenter, in whose presence people may withhold criticism) feeds 
the group with stimuli, or material to react to, as well as encouraging the 
reticent to speak up, and discouraging the talkative from dominating the 
proceedings. And when the topic is radio, one essential function of the 
moderator is to stop the participants from talking about television!
<p>Each group should have a second person from the organizing team, to act as 
secretary. Though it is possible for an experienced moderator to fulfil both 
functions, it is valuable to have a second organizer present, so that the two 
can compare their conclusions after the participants have left. But if too many 
people from the organizing team are present, participants are likely to feel 
nervous and inhibited. If there are 12 participants, there should not be more 
than about 5 organizers present. Apart from the moderator and secretary, the 
other organizers should hardly speak at all. Other people who may be present 
include:
  <l>a video-camera or tape-recorder operator. 
  <l>somebody to provide drinks or food for the participants. 
  <l>an observer from the client organization. 
<h>Initial questionnaires
<p>It hardly ever happens that all participants in a group arrive at the same time. 
Even when we ask people to be sure to arrive at the advertised starting time, 
some arrive late, and others arrive much too early. As soon as they arrive, 
participants are keen to know what will be happening. It can be tiresome to 
repeat this over and over again, as each new participant arrives. To give them 
something to do, we usually have a preliminary questionnaire, which people can 
fill in as soon as they arrive. Those who arrive late can fill in their 
questionnaire while the discussion takes place. 
<p>As well as giving participants something to do while the others arrive, these 
questionnaires can collect useful information. They can also be used to raise 
questions that participants can think about and discuss later: such as "If you 
could make one change to FM99, what would it be?"
<p>These questionnaires are short and simple. I try to restrict them to a single 
sheet of paper, with questions only on one side. As some people prefer to 
communicate in writing, we let participants keep their questionnaires throughout 
the discussion, and invite them to write their thoughts and comments on the 
blank back of the questionnaire.
<h>Seating arrangements
<p>A good type of room arrangement is a large table (or several smaller tables 
pushed together) around which the participants sit in chairs. The tabletop is 
useful for filling in questionnaires, and for food, drink, and microphones. 
<p>Another good arrangement is a D-shaped one. The participants sit in a 
semi-circle, with the moderator near the centre. The straight part of the D is 
the wall on which the results are displayed. The secretary sits at one end of 
the D. If there is a photographer or video operator, this person usually stands 
somewhere near the other end of the D.
<p>In some cultures, people prefer to sit on the floor. This is no impediment, but 
if the participants are to fill in questionnaires, you will need to supply a 
writing surface (such as a clipboard) for each participant. 
<h>Displaying data
<p>An essential part of the consensus group technique is the poster: large sheets 
of paper, taped to the nearest wall, or on an easel. On these posters, the 
secretary writes the findings of the group, in large letters so that all 
participants can read them. (If some or most are illiterate, symbols can be used 
as well as words.) It’s also possible to use a blackboard or whiteboard, but 
large sheets of paper are best because they can be taken away and kept as a 
record of the discussion. 
<p>Lately we have found a better method. Instead of using a few large sheets of 
paper, we have used many small sheets of paper, about A4 size: one for each 
statement.
<h>Electronic recording
<p>If possible, the whole discussion should be recorded, either on video tape or on 
an audio cassette. Video has many advantages, but it has the disadvantage of 
requiring a camera operator. Though it is possible to set up a video camera and 
simply point it at a group of people sitting in a semicircle, most detail will 
be lost, without an operator to zoom in on each person as they speak, and to 
record the reactions of other participants.
<p>You might expect that to have a video operator present would greatly distract 
the participants, but we have found this is not so. After the first few minutes, 
participants usually stop noticing the video camera. (This is obvious when 
replaying a video recording, because participants seldom look directly at the 
camera.) The video operator should intrude as little as possible, and stand back 
at a reasonable distance. Note that, to focus on a whole group of 12 or more 
people, you will often need a larger room than you might expect — or a video 
camera whose lens can zoom out to an unusually wide angle. 
<p>If a video camera is not available, the next best thing is to record the 
discussion on audiocassette or minidisc. This does not require a separate 
operator — the secretary or moderator can work it. Some requirements for 
successful audio taping are:
<p>• With a video recording, you can see who is speaking, but with audio, some 
voices may sound the same. To help identify voices, the moderator should address 
participants by name as often as possible. The moderator may also need to 
describe other things that are happening which will not be recorded on the tape. 
For example, if a participant shows the others a printed advertisement, the 
moderator should describe what is happening.
<p>• You need a good microphone. After much experimentation, we discovered the 
boundary layer or PZM microphones, which are made by several manufacturers. A 
boundary mike looks like a flat piece of metal, about 20 cm square. It sits on a 
tabletop or other flat surface, and records all sounds reaching that surface. 
The microphones built into cassette recorders are usually of too low a quality 
to pick up voices clearly, specially when several people are speaking at once, 
and the microphone is more than a few metres away. Microphones designed for 
broadcasting don’t work well in this situation, because they are designed to 
pick up sounds from only one main direction 
<p>• Double-check that everything is working! It is surprisingly easy for something 
to go wrong when you are making a recording. Batteries may go flat (in either 
the recorder or the microphone), plugs may not be inserted fully, the tape can 
be set to "pause" and forgotten, the volume control can be turned right down, 
the machine can be switched to "play" instead of "record", and so on. I prefer a 
tape recorder with an indication of the volume (flashing LED lights or a VU 
meter), and a tape compartment with a clear window so that you can check that 
the tape is turning. 
<h>Identifying participants
<p>We use name tents to help identify the participants to each other and to the 
organizers. A name tent is a folded piece of cardboard, with a participant’s 
name written on it, like this: 

<p>If the name tents are put on the table in advance, this can be used as a way of 
planning where people sit. If a few of the participants are from the same 
family, they are likely to distract the other participants by whispering if 
seated next to each other, so it is a good idea to separate them.
<p>If the participants are not sitting at a table, an alternative to using name 
tents is to draw a map of the seating arrangements, marked with all the 
participants’ names. This can be displayed on a wall for all to see. 
<h>6. First stage: introduction
<p>When almost all participants have arrived, the discussion can begin. In the 
first stage, the moderator introduces himself or herself, and asks each other 
participant to do the same. Here we are looking for information that will help 
to understand that person’s later comments. For example, if the topic is a radio 
station, I find it helpful to ask participants to describe their households, 
their daily routine, and their radio listening habits. Another purpose of this 
first stage is to help each participant gain confidence in speaking to others in 
the group.
<p>Not a lot of detail is needed here: each person should talk for one or two 
minutes. The moderator’s own introduction will set an example for others to 
follow.
<p>This stage usually about 20 minutes, for a group of 12 people. 
<h>7. Second stage: discussion
<p>After all participants have made their introductory talk, the moderator begins 
the second stage, by outlining the issues that the discussion will cover. This 
should be done very broadly, so that issues will be placed in their context. For 
example, if the study is about a radio station’s programs, it is useful to 
gather opinions on other media which may compete with radio for people’s time: 
television, newspapers, and so on. 
<p>If the participants do not already know which station is conducting the 
research, it may be best not to tell them just yet, so that their opinions will 
be more unbiased. In some cultures, if participants know which organization is 
conducting the research, they are reluctant to criticize it in the presence of 
people from that organization. Almost certainly, they will identify the 
organization later in the discussion, so the early stages are the only 
opportunity to hear completely unbiased opinions.
<p>When each participant speaks in turn, this ensures that everybody has a say, but 
doing this for hours makes conversation very awkward. My preference is to begin 
and end the discussion phase by asking each participant in turn to say something 
about the topic. For the rest of the discussion phase, anybody can speak, as 
they wish. Sometimes the moderator needs to intervene to prevent one or two 
people from dominating the discussion, or to encourage the shyer participants to 
have their say.
<p>The organizers should not be drawn into the discussion. If a participant asks 
the moderator "what do you think of this matter?" the moderator should answer 
"it’s your opinions that are important here, not mine. I don’t want to influence 
you. " The purpose of the meeting is for the listeners to provide information to 
the organization that is conducting the research. But participants may try to 
reverse the flow of information, and begin questioning the organizers in detail. 
If the organizers respond, much of the meeting time can be wasted. The moderator 
should handle such questions by stating that there will be a "question time" at 
the end of the meeting.
<p>The discussion itself can be either structured or unstructured (the difference 
is explained below), and will typically run for 1 to 2 hours. The moderator can 
usually control the duration. While discussion takes place, the secretary notes 
down statements which most of the participants seem to agree with. These 
statements are usually not written on a poster at this stage, but on a sheet of 
paper for the secretary’s later use. We’ve found that displaying statements soon 
seems to stop participants from thinking further about a topic. If anything is 
written on a poster at this stage, it should be a question or a topic, not a 
conclusion.
<h>Unstructured discussions
<p>An unstructured discussion is one in which the moderator merely introduces the 
broad topic, and sits back to let everybody else talk. The advantage of this 
approach is that participants feel unfettered by restrictions, and may provide 
useful and unexpected insights. The disadvantage is that much of the discussion 
may be irrelevant, and will not provide useful information. Therefore it is 
normal for the moderator to interrupt when the discussion drifts away from the 
stated topic. For example, if the stated topic is radio, the discussion will 
often drift onto television. 
<p>If the organizers have a list of questions they want answered, an unstructured 
discussion will usually cover most topics, without the moderator having to 
introduce the topics one at a time. The moderator can have a list of topics, and 
check them off as they are covered. Towards the end of the discussion period, 
the moderator can ask specifically about topics that have not been discussed.
<h>Structured discussions
<p>With a structured discussion, the moderator introduces issues one at a time, and 
asks the participants to discuss them. The moderator should avoid asking the 
participants any questions which can be answered Yes or No. (If that is the type 
of information you want, you should be doing a formal survey, not qualitative 
research.) Instead, the moderator should say things like:
<p>• "Tell me some of the things you like about the breakfast program on FM99."
<p>• "Why do you no longer listen to that program?"
Both of the above questions are the type that seek detailed responses, and are 
loose enough to allow for unexpected answers. If the questions asked are too 
specific, you risk not finding out the essential facts.
<p>Another type of structured discussion involves playing excerpts of programs from 
a prepared tape. Reactions to specific programs are uslaly more useful than 
general comment. For this purpose, we normally prepare tapes of 10 to 20 short 
program extracts, averaging around one minute — just long enough to illustrate a 
particular point, or jog the memories of people who are not sure whether they 
have heard or seen a program before.
<p>Play one item at a time, then let people talk about it for a few minutes. 
<p>Consensus group participants often express themselves vaguely, making comments 
such as "I’m not very impressed with the news on FM99." Statements like this are 
not useful, and need to be followed up with questions, such as "What is it that 
you don’t like?" or asking them for some specific examples. If the moderator 
does this a few times early in each discussion, the other participants will see 
what sort of comment is most useful.
<h>Structured vs unstructured
<p>The main advantage of an unstructured discussion is that it will often produce 
ideas which the moderator and secretary have not thought of. The main 
disadvantage of unstructured discussions is that they take a lot longer, because 
participants tend to drift off the subject.
<p>However, a discussion need not be wholly structured or wholly unstructured. It 
can begin in one of these modes, and move to the other. It’s best to begin 
unstructured, and introduce structure later. If you do it in the reverse order, 
beginning with a structured discussion then allowing some unstructured time at 
the end, participants seldom come up with fresh ideas.
<h>Generating statements
<p>The output of a consensus group is a set of statements. These can come from 
either the organizers or the participants:
<p>From the moderator or secretary:
  <p>A few initial statements, fairly bland (so as not to bias the discussion) but 
  clearly phrased (to show participants the expected style) 
  <p>Statements agreed on by previous groups in the same series; 
  <p>Findings from earlier research on the same subject. 
<p>From participants:
  <p>Their spontaneous opinions 
  <p>Their reactions to statements made by other participants 
  <p>Their impressions and reports of what other people (not present) think. 
  <p>Each participant in turn can be asked to make a statement that he or she 
  thinks most people agree with. 
<p>Initially, some participants make timid statements that provide little 
information, even though most others would agree. For example, "the sky is blue" 
is clear and concise - but how useful is it? Even worse: "the sky is often 
bluish, but sometimes it’s more grey." When statement-making begins, the 
moderator should encourage participants to make more daring statements, which 
may only just reach a consensus. For example: "In this area, in the dry season, 
the sky is mostly blue for five days each week."
<p>In some societies, such as Cambodia, oratory skill is prized, and participants 
often make short speeches instead of statements. In other societies, such as 
Australian farmers, statements are so short that they will not be clear to 
others outside the group. In both cases, it is up to the moderator to convert 
such utterances into clear, concise statements - typically 10 to 20 words, much 
like a survey question. The same criteria apply as in questionnaires (see the 
Questionnaires chapter): statements must be unambiguous, deal with a single 
issue, and be clear enough for people to agree or disagree with. 
<p>At this stage, the wording of a statement is mainly up to the person making it. 
Too much correction by the moderator can dissuade other participants from making 
statements. If there are minor problems with wording, these can be fixed later.
<p>When participants can think of no more statements, it’s often good to have a 
short break. Participants can have a drink, and some time to marshal their 
thoughts. In a recent consensus group in Vietnam, the trainee moderator thought 
participants were a bit gloomy, so he got them all to sing a song!
<h>8. Third stage: consensus
<p>In the final stage, we seek consensus on the issues discussed in the second 
phase of the session. By this time, the secretary will have a list of statements 
that he or she thinks most participants may agree with. The secretary now 
displays each statement in turn, and the moderator invites participants to agree 
or disagree with it.
<p>The object is to find a statement phrased in such a way that the great majority 
of participants are able to agree with it. The original statement will usually 
need to be altered somewhat so that as many people as possible can agree with 
it. 
<p>The simplest way for participants to show agreement is by raising their hands. 
This works well in some cultures, where people are more assertive or 
individualistic (e.g. Western and Chinese-influenced societies), but in more 
group-minded cultures (e.g. Buddhist societies, Japan) participants are often 
reluctant to show that they disagree with others. 
<p>A more discreet way to indicate agreement is for a participant to hold up a 
palm-sized piece of cardboard. This can be held close to the chest, and is much 
less obvious to others than an upraised hand.
<p>We normally give each participant a bright green card - the colour needs to 
contrast with the participants’ clothes, so that the cards will be visible in 
the videotape or photographs. 
Voting is in two stages. For each statement in turn, the moderator reads it out, 
and shows it written on the wall. 
<p>The first stage is to check that everybody knows precisely what it means. 
Participants are asked to raise their hands (or their cards) if they are certain 
of its exact meaning; often they will not be. If even a single participant 
admits to being uncertain, the statement should be reworded. Sometimes the 
person who first made a statement needs to be asked exactly what it means. The 
secretary or the moderator will then suggest a revised wording, and participants 
are again asked if they know exactly what it means. When all participants are 
certain of the meaning, the voting can go ahead.
<p>Participants are now asked to display their cards or raise their hands if they 
agree with the statement. Some people want to half-agree with a statement. We 
tell them: "Unless you’re sure that you agree, don’t hold your card up."
<p>As the moderator reads out each statement, and points it out on the wall, and 
asks how many agree with it, the secretary (who is facing the participants) 
counts the number of cards or hands being held up. 
<p>We declare a consensus if at least three quarters of participants agree: at 
least 8 out of 10 voters, 9 out of 11, or 9 out of 12. Whether the threshold of 
consensus is set at 70% or 80% or 90%, it makes little difference to the 
results.
<p>If only a few participants do not agree with a statement, they are asked which 
parts of it they don’t agree with. The moderator asks these people "Could you 
agree with it if a few words were changed?" Often, this is possible. If a 
statement expressed in an extreme way is softened a little, more people will 
agree with it. 
<p>For example, this may strike some people as extreme...
<p>• People who do not listen to FM99 should have a loudspeaker set up in the 
street outside their home and be forced to listen to FM99 all day.
<p>Not many people would agree. A few more might agree that...
<p>• People who do not listen to FM99 should be given a free radio which only 
receives FM99.
<p>But hardly anybody would disagree with...
<p>• People who do not listen to FM99 should be told that it exists.
<p>When consensus has been reached, the secretary writes the modified statement on 
the poster, together with the numbers who agree. For example, if 11 out of 12 
people agreed:
<p>People who do not listen to FM99 should be told that it exists. 11/12
<h>When there’s no consensus
<p>Sometimes it is not possible to reach consensus, and the group will divide into 
two sections, with no common ground. In such a case, try to get two statements, 
each with as many as possible agreeing, and record both statements, with 
appropriate annotation. 
<p>It’s best to put non-agreed statements aside until all statements have been 
worked through, then come back and reconsider the non-agreed statements. There 
are two reasons for this. Firstly, it’s possible to spend so long arguing over 
non-agreed statements that the group has no time to finish properly. Secondly, 
after all the original statements have been worked through, participants will 
have a better knowledge of each other’s positions, and more will easily agree on 
statements which they could not agree on at first.
<p>If few people agree with a statement (no more than about 4 out of 12) it’s often 
useful to reword the statement as the exact opposite of the original. You might 
expect that if 4 of 12 agree with a statement, 8 should agree with its opposite. 
But this is often not true - sometimes almost everybody will agree with the 
opposite. In other cases, the group will be evenly split.
<p>When between one third and two thirds of the participants agree with a 
statement, this can signal several things:
<p>(a) The statement may be confused, or contain several different ideas: so try 
splitting the statement into two separate statements.
<p>(b) There is a fundamental division of opinion within the group: in this case, 
reword the statement to maximize the split, so that there is a consensus within 
each of two factions.
<p>After the secretary has finished going through the statements that were noted 
during the discussion stage, participants are asked to add statements that they 
feel most others will agree with. Each participant in turn can be asked to make 
a statement, which is then modified and voted on in the same way. 
<p>The moderator may then offer some final statements for evaluation. Unless this 
is the first of a set of consensus groups, now is the time when statements 
agreed in earlier group sessions can be shown to participants. Because the 
wording has already been clarified in the earlier groups, there’s usually no 
need to modify it now. It’s simply a matter of voting, which can be very quick 
in this case.
<p>When the purpose of the project is to help an organization understand its 
audience, I’ve found it helpful to add some groups with the staff as 
participants, keeping staff of different status levels in separate groups. The 
statements produced by staff are often very different from those produced by the 
audience, and different groups of staff (unlike different audience groups) often 
produce statements that are very different from each other’s. This can be very 
educational for management.
<p>In a typical 2-hour session, most participants agree on about 20 to 30 
statements. As a final step, the moderator can ask participants to classify the 
statements into groups of similar statements, then for each of these groups of 
statements to produce a new statement summarizing the whole group.
<p>Finally, the statements can be laid out on a large sheet of paper. Imagine all 
possible statements being spread out in two dimensions, as if on a map. An 
irregular shape on this map might define the statements with which most people 
agree. At the centre of the map are the statements that are so obvious that they 
are hardly worth stating. For example, all regular listeners to a radio station 
might agree with "I usually like what I hear when I listen to FM99." (Otherwise, 
they probably wouldn’t listen.) Towards the edge of the irregular outline on the 
map are the borderline statements, at the boundaries of agreement of the 
station’s listeners. An example of a borderline statement might be "Though I 
usually listen to FM99, I listen to other stations when I don’t like the FM99 
program." These borderline statements tend to be more interesting, and less 
obvious. Beyond that borderline are the statements on which agreement could not 
be reached.
<p>The consensus-seeking stage of the discussion will typically last between 30 
minutes and one hour, depending on how many statements are offered for 
discussion. Sometimes a group will split into two sub-groups, which hardly agree 
on anything. In these cases (which are rare) the consensus stage will take much 
longer.
<h>Why separate the discussion and consensus stages?
<p>You may wonder why discussing issues and reaching consensus are presented as two 
separate stages of the discussion. Wouldn’t it be more efficient to take each 
topic one at a time, reach consensus on that, then move on to the next topic? I 
have tried this, but found it impedes the flow of discussion. Also, returning to 
a topic at the consensus stage gives people more time to gather their thoughts, 
and consensus seems more easily reached after a time gap. The only exception is 
when the discussion is structured, by being divided into a number of clear parts 
— for example when a lot of short program excerpts are being played to the 
participants, and they reach agreement on each one separately. 
<h>9. Summarize the results
<p>Sometimes the most difficult part of running a consensus group is to persuade 
the participants to leave at the end of it. With some groups, nobody wants to go 
home, and most participants may sit around and talk for an hour or two longer; 
my record is 5 hours. I find these late sessions very useful. By that time, the 
participants know each other (and the organizers) much better, and may volunteer 
information which they did not want to do in the "official" part of the 
discussion. For this reason, I usually leave a tape recorder running for as long 
as possible.
<p>The outcome of each group is one or more posters listing the agreed statements, 
showing how many people agreed with each statement.
<p>After three group sessions, you will have three sets of statements. The reason 
for holding three groups is that one group may develop its thoughts in quite a 
strange way, perhaps due to one or two powerful personalities. With two groups, 
one of which may be atypical, you won’t know which is which, but with three, if 
the results from one group are very different from those of the other two, you 
will know that one is atypical.
Though you will never get three groups coming up with exactly the same set of 
statements, we have always found strong similarities. If at least two of the 
three groups came up with similar statements, these statements can be safely 
assumed to be representative of the whole audience sampled. No matter how 
differently the three groups are selected, we usually find a lot of agreement 
between the lists of statements when the discussions have been conducted in the 
same way. Observing the similarities will give you confidence that the results 
are true of the entire population studied, not only of the three disparate 
groups.
<p>Have the three lists of statements typed out, or lay them out in map-like form 
as described above. This will be the basis of a report resulting from the 
discussions. Add a description of any taped stimulus material, and the criteria 
used for selecting listeners, complete a survey summary form, and that may be 
sufficient. If you have taped the discussions (whether on audio or videotape) 
you can copy relevant comments to illustrate each of the agreed statements, and 
include these in a more detailed report.
<p>In summary, the consensus group technique is one that can be used by 
inexperienced researchers with reasonable safety. It is more difficult to draw 
wrong conclusions with this technique than with other types of qualitative 
research, and the findings are often more directly useful than those from formal 
surveys. However, the technique is not a simplistic one. Even highly experienced 
researchers can use it, to supplement the focus group technique. Inexperienced 
researchers will find that as they conduct more and more consensus groups, they 
will be better able to fashion the agreed statements. As well as being an 
accurate reflection of the participants’ opinions, these statements are more 
usable by the organization which has commissioned the research.
