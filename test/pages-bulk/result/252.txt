      <h>Around 63,500 adults now living with HIV in the UK24th November 2006
       
      <p>An estimated 63,500 adults are now living with HIV in the United Kingdom, 
      according to the latest report from the UK’s Health Protection Agency. 

      <p>It is now 25 years since the first case of AIDS was reported in the UK, 
      and while HIV infection rates dropped in the late 1980s and early 1990s 
      following a powerful public health campaign, they have risen substantially 
      in recent years. 

      <p>7,450 new HIV diagnoses were made in 2005; a figure that will probably 
      rise as more cases are belatedly reported.  This compares to 7,492 
      diagnosed cases in 2004 and 7,283 in 2003.  Such increases are smaller 
      than those seen in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when around 500 extra 
      people were being diagnosed every year, leading some at the HPA to 
      speculate that the epidemic may be levelling off in the UK. 

      <p>The number of diagnoses does not however represent the number of people 
      who have been newly infected in the UK.  The HPA estimates that 20,100 
      (32%) of the 63,500 people living with HIV in Britain today do not know 
      they have the virus. 

      <p>Of particular concern are men who have sex with men (MSM).  2,356 new 
      diagnoses were made in 2005 amongst MSM, the highest number ever recorded 
      since the beginning of the epidemic.  The prevalence of previously 
      undiagnosed HIV infection amongst MSM in the UK now stands at 3.2%, or 
      about 1 in 30. 

      <p>Black and minority ethnic (BME) populations living in the UK are also at a 
      higher risk of HIV.  Nearly two-thirds of diagnoses made in 2005 were 
      amongst BME populations, and the current prevalence of HIV among black 
      Africans living in the UK now stands at 3.6%. 

      <p>“The global HIV epidemic continues to affect Black and ethnic minority 
      populations in the UK,” said Dr Valerie Delpech, an HIV expert at the HPA. 
       “Although the majority of these are contracted in countries of higher 
      prevalence and particularly through links with Africa, more of these cases 
      are now being contracted within the UK . The number of reports of 
      HIV-infected black Africans who contracted their infection in the UK 
      increased from 43 in 2000 to 182 in 2005.” 

      <p>Professor Pat Troop, Chief Executive of the Health Protection Agency 
      added, “Over the last 25 years there have been key successes in the 
      control and management of HIV and the Agency is tasked with taking forward 
      a number of initiatives such as the National Chlamydia Screening Programme 
      and monitoring of waiting times at genitourinary medicine [GUM] clinics.” 

      <p>Waiting times for clinic appointments are supposed to be no more than 48 
      hours according to government targets, but many people have to wait far 
      longer.  Given that workloads at GUM clinics have increased by 268% since 
      1996, this is perhaps not surprising. 

      <p>790,443 cases of other sexually transmitted infections were identified in 
      2005, with chlamydia diagnoses rising by 5% on 2004 figures, and syphilis 
      rising by 23%.  Gonorrhoea however fell by 13% to 19,392 cases in 2005, 
      although levels of antibiotic resistant strains of gonorrhoea increased to 
      22% in England and Wales in 2005.

      <h>Migration and HIV misunderstood in the UK16th November 2006
       
      <p>A new report published this week by the UK’s Health Protection Agency has 
      highlighted a problem of late diagnosis of HIV infection amongst the 
      migrant population of England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and has caused 
      confusion in the tabloid press. 

      <p>The report, “Migrant Health”, found that amongst the 4,253 people that 
      were diagnosed with HIV in 2004 and had their place of birth recorded, 
      approximately 70% were from abroad.  The most common country of origin was 
      Zimbabwe, whose current dire economic crisis and appalling track record on 
      basic human rights have led many to seek asylum in the UK.  Zimbabwe has 
      an adult HIV prevalence of 20% but the current economic conditions mean 
      that access to antiretroviral treatment is severely limited.  Often there 
      is little choice but to move to somewhere where HIV treatment is available 
      to avoid death. 

      <p>The report does however state that around a third of non-UK born residents 
      receiving HIV diagnoses do so at least two years after their arrival in 
      the United Kingdom, suggesting that fears of ‘health tourism’, (whereby 
      migrants come to the UK specifically to receive treatment) are perhaps 
      unfounded.  In addition, around 92% of migrants receiving a positive HIV 
      diagnosis will also receive a diagnosis of AIDS within three months, 
      meaning they have probably delayed coming forward for HIV testing for a 
      long time.  Delaying testing and treatment can lead to a person developing 
      a range of serious opportunistic infections, putting additional strain on 
      emergency care services, and causing unnecessary suffering to both them 
      and their families.  The report recommends that the problems be addressed, 
      and that greater efforts be made to make healthcare accessible to the 
      migrant population. 

      <p>One barrier to achieving this goal however is the fact that migrants who 
      are here illegally, or whose asylum applications have failed, have to pay 
      for antiretroviral treatment on the National Health Service.  Very few can 
      afford the charges, so will instead avoid health care services altogether. 


      <p>Despite some worrying statistics, the HPA report is keen to stress that 
      only a very small proportion of migrants have any health problems, and 
      that that the UK is not on the verge of any sort of widespread HIV 
      epidemic. 

      <p>“HIV can be associated with stigma in many communities and … addressing 
      stigma requires culturally appropriate approaches with the affected groups 
      as well as education of the wider UK population,” the report states. 

      <p>“The general public need to be reassured that they cannot acquire HIV 
      through normal social contact with affected individuals. This will help to 
      avoid the misconception that the non-UK born pose a health threat to the 
      general population which can lead to prejudice that is unlikely to 
      contribute to overall HIV control.” 

      <p>Despite this recommendation, the findings have been interpreted in 
      unhelpful and confusing ways by some newspapers. 

      <p>On Thursday, The Sun newspaper ran an article claiming that the wave of 
      new migrants from Romania and Bulgaria that is expected when those 
      countries join the EU, could lead to a serious “explosion” in cases of 
      HIV. 

      <p>Such dire warnings are entirely unfounded.  The vast majority of migrants 
      with HIV come from countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, where HIV prevalence 
      is very high.  Romania and Bulgaria by comparison have some of the lowest 
      HIV rates in the world, and indeed in Europe. The number of people living 
      with HIV in Romania totals an estimated 7,000 according to UNAIDS; less 
      than 0.1% of their population.  In Bulgaria, the numbers living with HIV 
      are even lower - fewer than 500 people are thought to have the virus 
      (again, under 0.1% of the population).  This compares to 150,000 in Italy 
      (0.5%), 140,000 in Spain (0.6%), 130,000 people in France (0.4%) and 
      68,000 people in the UK (0.2%).   

      <p>In fact, with our higher HIV prevalence, people living in the UK pose a 
      much greater ‘AIDS threat’ to Bulgarians and Romanians, than they do to 
      us.

      <h>UK government launches new sexual health campaign13th November 2006
       
      <p>A new national government-funded campaign on sexual health was launched on 
      Saturday in an attempt to combat the exponential rise in sexually 
      transmitted infections (STIs) being seen across the United Kingdom. 

      <p>The visual campaign, which incorporates television and print 
      advertisements, depicts young people displaying the names STIs on their 
      clothing in place of the usual designer logos.  It then goes on to 
      encourage young people to use a condom with the phrase “Condoms: essential 
      wear.”  The TV adverts will appear on Channel 4, Five and various digital 
      channels, while print adverts will feature in popular young people’s 
      magazines.  Radio adverts that have been produced in a similar style will 
      also discuss the physical effects of STIs. 

      <p>The campaign is aimed at 18-24 year olds, the group judged most likely to 
      transmit and become infected with STIs, and is designed to complement a 
      number of more low-key web-based programmes (such as the ‘R U Thinking?’ 
      campaign) aimed at younger teens. 

      <p>It is twenty years since the government ran the last major TV campaign on 
      sexual health, which featured the famous slogan “AIDS: Don’t Die Of 
      Ignorance” engraved on a tombstone.  The advert, and an accompanying 
      leaflet that was delivered to every home, had a considerable impact on the 
      rates of transmission of all sexually transmitted infections.  Fear of 
      AIDS dramatically reduced the number of people having unprotected sex, an 
      effect that lasted until the mid-1990s.  As people’s memories of the 
      campaign faded however, so HIV and other STI infections began to rise.  
      Today, many doctors are warning that common STI infections, such as 
      chlamydia and herpes, are at near-epidemic proportions, with more serious 
      illness, such as HIV and syphilis also spreading rapidly. 

      <p>"Some STIs like chlamydia are on the increase amongst 18 to 24 year-olds 
      and it is vital that we deliver strong messages about using condoms to 
      prevent them,” said the Public Health Minister, Caroline Flint at the 
      launch of the campaign. 

      <p>“The aim of this campaign is to make carrying and using a condom among 
      this age group as familiar as carrying a mobile phone, lipstick or putting 
      on a seat-belt. This is not about encouraging promiscuity, but saying to 
      those who are already sexually active: sex without a condom is seriously 
      risky, so always use one.” 

      <p>While most sexual health groups have welcomed the long-overdue campaign, 
      there are those who have said it does not go far enough.  The original 
      budget for the programme announced back in 2003 was £50 million.  The 
      current campaign has cost just £4 million, leaving a potential £46 million 
      still to be spent. 

      <p>Caroline Flint has said that the £50 million total is meant to be spent 
      over three years.  It is however three years since the campaign was first 
      announced, and there have been no promises made that the rest of the 
      allotted cash will be used at any point in the future. 

      <p>Perhaps one reason why the campaign has been restricted in its scope is 
      the fact that Britain’s sexual health services are simply not in a fit 
      state to accept the huge influx of extra patients that are likely to seek 
      screening as a result of more widespread advertisements.  £300 million was 
      promised to improve and modernise Genitourinary Medicine (GUM) services 
      back in 2003, but because the cash was not specifically earmarked for 
      sexual health, many National Health Service Primary Care Trusts have used 
      the money to dig themselves out of debt instead.  Most GUM clinics 
      therefore remain understaffed and overstretched, with patients lucky to be 
      seen in two weeks rather than the two days recommended by the Department 
      of Health. 

      <p>Another reason for the restriction may be that fact that the government is 
      squeamish about discussing sexual health on television before the 9 
      o’clock watershed, when younger viewers may be watching.  Aiming the 
      campaign at 18 – 24 year olds overcomes this problem.  However, while some 
      STIs, such as chlamydia, are statistically most common in this age group, 
      STIs do also affect younger (and older) people in significant numbers, and 
      there is a danger that using very age-specific campaigns could lead other 
      groups to believe they are not at risk. 

      <p>A survey released this week for example has shown that many teens are 
      having sex for the first time before the legal age of sixteen, with girls 
      twice as likely as boys to lose their virginity before this age.  While 
      the government does have some online and print campaigns aimed at younger 
      teenagers, these are very low key, and their reach and impact has never 
      been officially assessed.  Encouraging condom use may well be 
      inappropriate for younger teens, but there is currently little in the way 
      of support for those who wish to wait until they are older to have sex, 
      and indeed many may not recognise it as an option.  Sex and relationships 
      education remains non-compulsory in schools outside the scope of basic 
      science lessons. 

      <p>With 95,000 people receiving diagnoses of Chlamydia last year, and 58,000 
      people now living with HIV in the UK, sexual health has to be made a far 
      bigger priority.  The tombstone advertisements of the 1980s may have been 
      overly-dramatic by today’s standards, but the fact that they were targeted 
      at everyone in the country meant that AIDS became an issue of national 
      importance that few people were ignorant of.  The campaign changed 
      cultural norms, and made sex without a condom simply unacceptable.  The 
      current adverts are a welcome first step towards a return to this way of 
      thinking, but it seems unlikely they will have any true or lasting affect 
      unless the campaign is sustained and broadened out to a wider audience.


       




      <h>Sexual health services getting worse not better, says top UK expert3rd 
      November 2006
       
      <p>A report by Channel 4 News has highlighted massive underfunding and 
      cutbacks in the UK's sexual health services, at a time when diagnoses of 
      sexually transmitted infections are soaring. 

      <p>In November 2004, the Department of Health promised a £300 million, 
      three-year programme to "modernise and transform sexual health services in 
      England." However, as was revealed in August, more than 80% of Primary 
      Care Trusts (PCTs) have chosen not to use this money solely for the 
      intended purpose; much of the "sexual health" budget has in fact gone 
      towards paying off debts. The Channel 4 News report looked at the impact 
      of the resultant underfunding. 

      <p>"The allocation for this area was over £200,000 recurrently," said Dr Colm 
      O'Mahoney, a hospital consultant who two years ago helped the government 
      determine how much spending was needed. "The PCT I work in has a £42.5 
      million debt and they're using all of the money to bail out that debt." Of 
      the £200,000, he has received "not one single penny". 

      <p>Part of the Department of Health's strategy was a national chlamydia 
      screening programme, which aimed to cover the whole of England by March 
      2007. That target is now unlikely to be met. At least 30 PCTs have already 
      withheld money from screening, according to Channel 4 News, and another 
      two trusts have actually suspended their screening programmes. 

      <p>Wirral Chlamydia Screening Programme was the first of its kind, and served 
      as a model for the national screening programme, yet today it does not 
      screen significantly more people than it did three or four years ago. Its 
      director, Dr Jenny Hopwood, said the situation was "serious" and that an 
      outside observer would probably not judge the programme a success. 

      <p>According to Dr Kate Guthrie of the Faculty of Planning and Reproductive 
      Health, Wirral is far from an exceptional case: 

      <p>"Clinics have been cut, senior staff have not been replaced, the hours of 
      clinics are being altered because it's cheaper to run during the day, but 
      actually their clientele want them in the evenings and at weekends," she 
      said. "We can't provide some of the more expensive yet very effective 
      methods of contraception, and we sometimes haven't even got enough support 
      staff to keep the clinics open." 

      <p>"No one is prepared to take any responsibility for this and I'm very 
      saddened indeed," said Professor Mike Adler, the UK's most senior sexual 
      health consultant, who five years ago wrote the national sexual health 
      strategy. "I had obviously hoped that having the very first sexual health 
      strategy would be the beginning of a minor revolution... That has not 
      happened... things have got worse." 

      <p>Another victim of underfunding is the long-awaited public awareness 
      campaign, which is now nearly a year and a half overdue. The messages 
      should start being broadcast in a few weeks' time, but they are unlikely 
      to have as much impact as was planned. Only £7.5 million will be spent on 
      the campaign, instead of the £50 million promised by government. 

      <p>In response to Channel 4 News' findings, Public Health Minister Caroline 
      Flint said she was "disappointed" that so many sexual health experts were 
      critical of the government's performance. She said that it was up to PCTs 
      to decide how to spend the money they were given, and that the 
      introduction of a national chlamydia screening programme and 
      over-the-counter testing kits were among recent positive developments.

      <h>Children across London to learn about HIV and AIDS2nd November 2006
       
      <p>Schools across London in the UK are being provided with an HIV and AIDS 
      education kit in a new initiative to raise awareness about the illness by 
      the charity Crusaid. 

      <p>The “Aware!” media kit is designed to fulfill the ‘media studies’ 
      component of the compulsory GCSE English syllabus.  It asks pupils to 
      watch a number of historical AIDS awareness campaigns, such as the famous 
      Tombstone adverts of the 1980s, and then create a media campaign of their 
      own. 

      <p>The idea is that the project will not only inspire creativity and help 
      students to understand modern media producation processes, but will also 
      gave them vital knowledge about HIV and AIDS. 

      <p>"Teachers involved in the pilot have welcomed the pack which tackles the 
      sensitive subject of HIV and Aids as part of regular coursework, making it 
      easier for children and adults to discuss these issues openly,” said 
      Steven Inman, head of grants and projects at Crusaid.


      <p>"This is a vital step toward a national HIV and Aids prevention drive in 
      schools.” 

      <p>The kit has initially been sent only to schools in London, but it is hoped 
      that Crusaid will eventually be able to secure government funding so that 
      it can be distributed nationwide.

      <h>Church of England appoints HIV+ priest11th September 2006
       
       <p>For the first time in the UK, a clergyman living with HIV has been 
      appointed as a parish priest. 

      <p>The new vicar, who has asked not to be named, will take up his post at a 
      church in London later this month.  He was appointed by an assistant 
      bishop known to be a supporter of the campaign to allow gay clergymen to 
      practice as priests within the Church of England.  The priest is believed 
      to be openly gay, but has pledged to refrain from sexual activity while in 
      office in accordance with Church of England rules. He replaces another 
      priest - also thought to be gay - who recently died. 

      <p>Over the past 15 years, around 25 to 20 members of the CofE clergy are 
      believed to have died of AIDS related causes, though this is the first 
      time that a man known to have HIV has been licensed as a priest.  His 
      appointment is likely to anger those within the Church of England who do 
      not support the employment of gay clergy, and intensify the argument 
      within the Anglican community as a whole. 

      <p>However, pro-gay members of the church are said to be very pleased with 
      his appointment. “This appointment is a sign of the church being grown-up 
      and living in the real world,” said one bishop.  “The priest has a 
      ministry to offer and clearly there is a welcome for him in his parish.”

      <h>One in three English teens have used condoms incorrectly11th August 2006
       
      <p>Many teenagers in England are not using condoms correctly, according to a 
      study published this week.

      <p>Researchers asked 1,373 young people in four areas of England to complete 
      a questionnaire about their sexual experiences, and 108 of these people 
      also kept a diary of their sex lives for 6 months. The results showed that 
      47% of the teenagers had ever had vaginal sex, and 62% of them reported 
      condom use on the most recent occasion. Among these condom users, six per 
      cent reported applying the condom after initial penetration, and another 
      six per cent removed the condom before stopping sex.

      <p>Among those who kept diaries, 31% said they had experienced late condom 
      application at least once during the six month period, and 9% reported 
      early removal.

      <p>The most common reasons given for applying a condom late were intimacy, 
      that it feels better without, that other contraception was used, and that 
      they got carried away. Only in one instance was a condom applied late in 
      an attempt to prevent sexually transmitted infections - on all other 
      occasions teenagers were more worried about avoiding pregnancy, preventing 
      mess or making sex last longer.

      <p>Young people who lacked confidence in their knowledge of correct condom 
      usage were more likely to use condoms inconsistently. Those who reported a 
      close relationship with their mother during their early teenage years were 
      less likely to use condoms imperfectly.

      <p>The authors of the study say their findings cast doubt on the validity of 
      asking teenagers simply whether they use condoms or not, without 
      investigating how those condoms are used. They say that it is important 
      for public health policies and programmes to address imperfect condom use 
      and its causes.

      <p>"It is essential that young people understand the importance of using 
      condoms consistently and correctly, and are also equipped with the skills 
      and knowledge to do so," conclude the authors. This statement is 
      especially timely given recent increases in sexually transmitted 
      infections in the UK.

      <h>HIV+ man sentenced to 40 months in prison7th August 2006
       
       <p>An HIV positive British man has been sentenced to forty months in prison, 
      despite being on the run from the police. 

      <p>Mark James, of Burgess Hill in West Sussex disappeared last month while on 
      bail, prompting police to issue a warrant for his arrest.  He had 
      previously admitted causing ‘biological’ grievous bodily harm, but 
      subsequently tried to change his plea to not-guilty claiming that he had 
      received poor legal advice.  The judge rejected his request, and last week 
      sentenced him to four years and three months in jail, a term that will 
      begin as soon as he is found. 

      <p>Mr James tested positive for HIV and syphilis in 2004, but failed to tell 
      his partner of his condition.  His partner only became aware of his status 
      when he also tested positive while in hospital for symptoms related to 
      acute HIV infection.   

      <p>His partner asserted that James deliberately tried to infect him with HIV, 
      a claim that both the judge and James himself rejected.  However, the 
      judge did find James guilty of recklessly transmitting the virus, a charge 
      that has been used in all criminal prosecutions for HIV in the UK to date. 
       This is the first time a gay couple has been involved in a criminal case. 


      <p>Many HIV organisations are against the criminalisation of HIV positive 
      people unless it can be definitively proven that the transmission of the 
      virus was deliberate.  As well as doing little to deter people from not 
      disclosing their status (if anything it encourages it by increasing the 
      stigma), most organisations argue that placing the emphasis on the HIV 
      positive person to use condoms does not encourage HIV negative people (or 
      people who do not know their status) to see condom use as their 
      responsibility too.

      <h>UK sexual health funding goes astray2nd August 2006
       
       <p>Much of the £300 million earmarked to improve sexual health services in 
      the UK has been spent on digging local NHS services out of debt, a new 
      report has revealed. 

      <p>The Independent Advisory Group (IAG) on Sexual Health and HIV found that 
      out of 191 NHS Primary Care Trusts surveyed, only 30 were actually 
      spending the money exclusively on sexual health services.  The rest were 
      using some or all of their allocation to fill funding gaps and combat 
      overspending on hospitals, drugs and GP services. 

      <p>When the extra £300 million was proposed by the government two years ago, 
      many sexual health organisations warned that the cash would go astray, 
      because the government failed to set strict guidelines on how it should be 
      used.  Today’s report therefore comes a no surprise to many working in the 
      field. 

      <p>“It was obvious even two years ago that the NHS was facing a financial 
      crisis, so it was inevitable that without ring fencing, much of this money 
      wouldn’t reach its intended destination,” said a spokesperson for AVERT.  
      "And yet still the government is refusing to insist that this £300 million 
      is actually spent on the services it is meant for." 

      <p>“It would be a great disappointment if the nation's sexual health were 
      sacrificed on the altar of financial balance in the NHS” added Nick 
      Partridge from the Terrence Higgins Trust. 

      <p>Levels of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections have been 
      increasing steadily in the UK for several years, and are currently at the 
      highest levels ever recorded. Many Genitourinary Medicine (GUM) clinics 
      are in desperate need of modernisation and expansion to cope with these 
      increasing numbers. 

      <p>"The IAG believes that it is essential that strategic health authorities 
      and PCTs recognise that investment in frontline sexual health services 
      will save them a great deal of money in the future,” said Baroness Gould, 
      chairperson of the IAG.  “Better sexual health services bring benefits for 
      patients as well as delivering cost savings for the NHS by reducing the 
      number of sexually transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancies."

      <h>UK shows success in reducing Mother to Child Transmission1st August 2006
       
       <p>A new report published by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child 
      Health has found that 90% of women are now agreeing to take an HIV test 
      during their pregnancy in the UK.  This compares to just 30% in 1997 
      before ‘opt-out’ testing (whereby a woman is given an HIV test 
      automatically unless she specifically states she does not want one) was 
      introduced. 

      <p>In 1997, around 20% of infants born to mothers with HIV became infected 
      because of poor testing rates.  By 2004, the figure stood at just 4%.  
      However, although the proportion of babies who acquire HIV from their 
      mothers has fallen significantly, the number of pregnant HIV+ women being 
      cared for in the UK has risen dramatically, meaning that the actual number 
      of babies being born with HIV has not dropped all that much.  Some babies 
      are also acquiring HIV despite the full range of 
      prevention-of-mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) methods being employed.

      <p>1504 children were born to HIV+ mothers in the UK and Ireland in the 9 
      years between 1990 and 1999.  505 of these children (34%) were found to be 
      HIV+.  This compares to 1120 children who were born to HIV+ women in 2004 
      alone.  25 (2%) of these children were diagnosed as HIV+, 202 (18%) 
      received indeterminate results, and 893 (80%) were found to be HIV 
      negative.  

      <p>“Antenatal screening has contributed significantly to the early detection 
      of HIV positive women,” said Dr Fortune Ncube, a blood borne virus expert 
      at the Health Protection Agency.  “In addition to the benefits of reducing 
      vertical transmission, women in knowing their status have benefited from 
      optimal HIV care and therapy. It is important to stress however that this 
      improving situation can only be maintained if a high uptake of antenatal 
      testing is sustained.”

      <h>HIV on the increase in Scottish seniors19th July 2006
       
      <p>New data published by Health Protection Scotland has found an alarming 
      increase in the numbers of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) 
      identified among people over the age of 50.   

      <p>STI diagnoses in senior Scots have trebled over the past five years, with 
      HIV, chlamydia and herpes all becoming more common. 

      <p>In 2000, just 0.7% of over-50s testing for HIV received a positive result. 
       By 2005 this figure stood at 2.2%.  Diagnoses of chlamydia also rose from 
      43 cases in 2000, to 91 in 2005, and herpes cases increased from 32 to 107 
      during the same period. 

      <p>The current figures reflect a general rise in STIs in all age groups, but 
      they are also indicative of a change in sexual behaviour amongst people in 
      their senior years.  Higher divorce rates, better health (leading to more 
      sex) and “swinging” (partner swapping) have all been blamed for the 
      increase, as has the fact that many people over the age of 50 will have 
      entirely missed out on messages about STIs and safer sex in their younger 
      years. 

      <p>"There is nothing unusual in people in their 70s or 80s visiting us,” said 
      Dr Rak Nandwani of the Sandyford Initiative sexual health unit in Glasgow. 
       "We must get rid of the idea sex is something that stops when you hit 
      50."

      <h>UK policy on HIV and asylum seekers 'violates human rights', says BMJ14th 
      July 2006
       
      <p>The UK government’s policy of denying treatment to failed asylum seekers 
      living with HIV is a violation of international human rights law, 
      according to an editorial published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) 
      this week. 

      <p>In the past, UK law granted free access to treatment to all those who had 
      resided in the UK for twelve months or more, including failed asylum 
      seekers and others living in the country without due authority. This meant 
      that the majority of overseas visitors who required HIV treatment had 
      access to it. 

      <p>Since 2004, though, legislation has dictated that HIV treatment is only 
      available for free to those living in the country legally, meaning that 
      failed asylum seekers and illegal immigrants must pay for any treatment 
      that they recieve. Given that members of these groups are not allowed to 
      work in the UK and are often poor, many simply cannot afford the charges. 

      <p>The government claims that the aim of this legislation is to prevent 
      ‘treatment tourism’, where people come to the country with the aim of 
      benefiting from free healthcare that they do not receive in their native 
      country. If HIV treatment were made available for free to everyone, they 
      argue, the NHS would be overwhelmed by large numbers of patients from 
      countries where no such treatment is available, especially developing 
      countries that have a high level of HIV infection. 

      <p>Yet a number of organisations have argued that denying medical care to any 
      individual whose health is at risk is unethical and inhumane, regardless 
      of whether they are residing in the country legally or not. 

      <p>Writing in this week’s BMJ, Peter Hall (chair of the group Doctors for 
      Human Rights) furthers this argument with the claim that the UK’s policy 
      is in violation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
      Cultural Rights. This treaty has been adopted by the United Nations 
      General Assembly (of which the UK is a member) since 1966. It sets 
      guidelines on human rights that member states are obliged to follow, 
      including a commitment to “recognize the right of everyone to the 
      enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental 
      health”. 

      <p>The current regulations on failed asylum seekers are not in line with this 
      clause, Hall argues, and the UK government is therefore failing to respect 
      the international agreement. He also claims that the legislation 
      compromises the position of doctors, who are naturally trained to provide 
      help to those who need it, and infringes on international and domestic 
      ethical codes. He joins a variety of other individuals and groups, 
      including the House of Commons Health Committee, who have spoken out 
      against the policy.

      <h>UK STIs still on the rise4th July 2006
       
      <p>The number of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) diagnosed annually in 
      the UK is still rising a new Health Protection Agency report has found. 

      <p>Cases of Chlamydia, the most common STI in the UK, increased by 5% in 
      2005, although gonorrhea fell by 13% on 2004 figures, the second year in a 
      row that levels have dropped.  Overall, there was a 3% rise in all STIs 
      diagnosed. 

      <p>Of particular concern for officials was a significant increase in the 
      number of new syphilis diagnoses, which went up by 23 percent from 2,278 
      in 2004 to 2,807 in 2005. 

      <p>Most syphilis cases over the past decade have occurred in gay men in the 
      UK.  However, the HPA say the infection is being identified in women with 
      increasing frequency.  The increase in cases was almost two and a half 
      times higher in women than among men in 2005. 

      <p>Professor Peter Borriello, director of the HPA's Center for Infections, 
      said that while the fall in gonorrhea was good news, the overall rise in 
      figures gave cause for concern. 

      <p>"It is disappointing to see that there was a further rise in new diagnoses 
      of STIs in 2005," he said in a press statement. 

      <p>"Today's figures serve as a reminder for people to take responsibility for 
      their own sexual health and that of their partners, and to use a condom 
      with new and casual partners."

      <h>UK woman sent to jail for transmitting HIV20th June 2006
       
      <p>A second British woman has been sent to jail for infecting a lover with 
      HIV. 

      <p>Sarah Jane Porter knew that she had HIV when she embarked on a two-year 
      relationship with her partner, a 31-year-old DJ from London, but had 
      repeated unprotected sex with him and failed to inform him of her status, 
      resulting in him becoming infected with HIV himself.  When he told her of 
      his HIV+ test result, she then accused him of having infected her. 

      <p>Psychologists told the court that Miss Porter was in complete denial about 
      her HIV+ status and very fearful of the social stigma attached to it, 
      which meant she felt unable to admit her condition.  She did however plead 
      guilty to charges of recklessly causing Grievous Bodily Harm in court, and 
      expressed regret at the hurt she had caused.  She was sentenced to 32 
      months in jail. 

      <p>This case is the latest in a series of criminal HIV transmission cases in 
      England and Wales, which many AIDS organisations say shows a worrying 
      return of the culture of blame and stigma that surrounded the epidemic in 
      the early years. 

      <p>AVERT, like a number of other HIV and AIDS charities, is sympathetic to 
      anyone who becomes infected with HIV and strongly discourages anyone from 
      concealing their HIV+ status from their partner.  We fully recognise the 
      distress caused by a positive HIV test result, the difficulties of living 
      with HIV, and the betrayal felt by those who have been infected by the 
      person they love, so we can understand why the individual in this case 
      chose to pursue this matter in a court of law. 

      <p>However, AVERT also holds the position that the current method of 
      criminalising ‘reckless’ transmission is very unhelpful from the 
      perspective of public health and that of discrimination and stigma. 

      <p>The fact that reckless HIV transmission is now potentially a criminal 
      matter, means that the police are assuming they have the right to fully 
      investigate anyone they suspect of having passed on HIV, sometimes on the 
      most tenuous of hear-say evidence.  The original complaint against Miss 
      Porter was filed by a man with whom she had recently split up.  This man 
      was HIV negative, but his account lead police to search Miss Porter's flat 
      for evidence of previous partners, an investigation which eventually led 
      them to a 31-year old DJ, who was HIV+ and willing to take his former 
      girlfriend to court.  Such investigations represent a gross invasion of 
      privacy, and paint a worrying picture of a police force that is wasting 
      many man hours actively tracking down and encouraging former partners to 
      make a complaint.  Such activity may be portrayed as justified in cases 
      such as Miss Porter's, where a conviction was ultimately obtained, but it 
      is believed that in many instances, police will raid homes and seize 
      medical records of entirely innocent people, purely on the basis of a 
      complaint from a former lover seeking revenge. 

      <p>When cases such as Miss Porter's do then get taken to court, they often 
      end in prison sentences for the defendant. UK prisons are already 
      overcrowded, and many studies have shown that HIV transmission inside 
      prisons is a common occurance.  A prison sentence is also unlikely to help 
      the guilty party (or indeed the victim) come to terms with their HIV 
      status or change their behaviour, nor is it going to act as a deterrent to 
      others – the law rarely features as a point of consideration in the 
      bedroom, as is evident from the huge numbers of young people that have sex 
      under age.  We therefore believe that if criminal prosecutions are to take 
      place at all, psychological counselling to help end their denial about 
      their status would be a far more useful outcome, and better still, HIV 
      campaigns and education should be made far more prominent to help people 
      protect themselves from infection in the first place. 

      <p>High profile court cases on such personal relationship matters are often 
      lengthy, and highly stressful for both sides (indeed, a number of 
      ‘victims’ now regret having tried to get justice through a court of law).  
      They can also heighten the stigma and idea of blame around the disease 
      (which is one of the reasons why Miss Porter failed to tell her partner 
      about it in the first place) and could put people off testing for HIV, in 
      the belief that if they don’t know their status, they can’t get 
      prosecuted.  Finally, they also place the responsibility for using condoms 
      on one person, when it should of course be a shared decision wherever 
      possible. 

      <p>In light of these complexities, and indeed many others that are further 
      discussed in our Criminal Transmission Page, AVERT believes that there 
      needs to be a thorough review of the law in this area, to provide guidance 
      to the police, judges and the press on how to handle cases such as these, 
      and to ensure that stigma, misinformation and damage to public health are 
      kept to a minimum.

      <h>Two new progress reports released on HIV in the UK7th June 2006
       
      <p>Two reports, one by the UK AIDS and Human Rights Project (AHRP), the other 
      by the National AIDS Trust (NAT) have both praised the UK’s record of 
      funding and supporting HIV and AIDS programmes overseas, but say that the 
      HIV epidemic in the country itself is being overlooked. 

      <p>The United Nation's General Assembly (UNGASS) Declaration of Commitment on 
      HIV and AIDS outlines the action that every member state must take in 
      order to tackle HIV and AIDS in their country.  Many see the UNGASS 
      declaration, which was updated and renewed at last week’s high level UN 
      meeting on HIV/AIDS, as a commitment that only applies to poor countries 
      carrying the greatest burden of HIV.  However, the declaration is equally 
      applicable within countries more traditionally seen as aid ‘donors’, 
      including the UK. 

      <p>With 7750 new infections diagnosed in 2005 alone, the United Kingdom has 
      one of the highest rates of HIV in Western Europe.  Yet according the NAT 
      report, in the last two years, there has not been a single speech given by 
      the Prime Minister or any Cabinet Minister focussing on the problem in the 
      UK.  The National Strategy for Sexual Health and HIV has not been updated 
      or even reviewed since 2001, and there are no firm governmental targets 
      relating to the reduction of HIV infection in the population.  The budget 
      for HIV prevention is also decreasing, particularly in London, where the 
      majority of cases are diagnosed. 

      <p>The AHRP report also reveals that the UK Department of Health failed to 
      submit a report on its progress towards achieving the Declaration of 
      Commitment goals before the UN's deadline in December. 

      <p>Such information has worried many AIDS organisations in the UK, who fear 
      that the recent focus on AIDS in Africa is leading people (and apparently 
      the government) to believe that it is no longer a problem in the country. 

      <p>There is however some good news.  Treatment of HIV in the UK is 
      second-to-none, with everyone entitled to treatment receiving optimal 
      care.  The Disability Discrimination Act now ensures that HIV+ people 
      cannot legally be discriminated against, and mother-to-child transmission 
      has been reduced dramatically over the past 10 years thanks to the 
      implementation of opt-out antenatal HIV screening.  Some policies relating 
      to the controversial area of HIV and migration have also been improved, 
      with HIV+ asylum seekers now only being ‘dispersed’ around the country if 
      they can be guaranteed access to HIV care and uninterrupted treatment.  
      Failed asylum-seekers and undocumented immigrants however still continue 
      to face unaffordable charges for National Health Service HIV treatment, 
      and the threat of deportation back to a country where HIV drugs are either 
      scarce or non-existent. 

      <p>Both reports now call for the UK government to renew its commitments on 
      AIDS, to stem the annual rise in new cases and ensure that all those 
      affected by the illness in the UK receive appropriate care and support.

      <p>Trafalgar Square in London will tomorrow be transformed into a family fun 
      zone in an effort to raise money for Body and Soul, a UK charity that 
      supports children, young people and families living with and affected by 
      HIV and AIDS. 

      <p>The Big Smile event is being held to mark the beginning of a major new six 
      month campaign, A Smile is a Gift, that aims to address the stigma and 
      prejudice that still surround HIV in the United Kingdom. 

      <p>“There hasn’t been a major campaign for HIV & AIDS in the UK since the 
      negative tombstone adverts of the 1980s,” said Daisy Harman a spokesperson 
      for Body and Soul.  “We wanted to do something more positive to tackle 
      stigma and show that HIV isn’t all doom and gloom.” 

      <p>The Big Smile will feature theatre performances from four West End shows, 
      as well as live sets from a variety of DJs and stand-up comedians.  
      Surrounding the main stage, there will be a collection of booths offering 
      complementary therapies, massage and a chance to try out the latest 
      Playstation games.  The National Gallery will also be running half-term 
      art activities for children throughout the day.  The Trafalgar Square 
      events will run from 12 to 3pm, followed by a variety of VIP events at the 
      Trafalgar Hotel and a party at the London nightclub, Pacha. 

      <p>Body and Soul offers holistic support services to 2,000 families, 700 
      children and 400 teenagers living with or affected by HIV.  Proceeds from 
      the event will go towards the refurbishment of the charity’s new centre 
      for children and young people, with further funds being raised through a 
      texting campaign that asks people to text ‘smile’ to 81156 to show their 
      support.

      <p>The UK MP Margaret Beckett has used her first public speech as Foreign 
      Secretary to highlight the threat of HIV and AIDS. 

      <p>Beckett, who was speaking at a fund-raising event for the Global Business 
      Coalition on HIV/AIDS, said that AIDS was a bigger threat to man than 
      either Iran or the terrorist group al-Queda.  However, she indicated her 
      priorities as foreign secretary by suggesting that climate change was 
      perhaps a greater threat in the long term. 

      <p>“Apart from perhaps climate change, I can think of no other challenge that 
      so threatens to reverse the progress our world has made in the past thirty 
      years than the threat of AIDS,” said Beckett.   

      <p>“We are at a critical moment in the global response.  History will judge 
      us on how we respond.”

      <h>Calls to make sex education compulsory24th May 2006
       
      <p>The UK’s Sex Education Forum has launched a year-long campaign to 
      encourage the government to make Personal, Social and Health Education 
      (PSHE) a compulsory part of the National Curriculum. 

      <p>Called “Beyond Biology”, the campaign asks schools to teach more than the 
      basic ‘biology’ of sexual intercourse, and enter into the emotional and 
      personal consequences of sexual relationships, including discussion of 
      HIV/AIDS, other sexually transmitted infections, adult relationships and 
      issues of trust and self-esteem. 

      <p>Sexual health organisations and other concerned individuals have been 
      calling for sex and relationships education (which is included as part of 
      PSHE) to be made compulsory for many years, but this is the first time 
      they have had the official backing of the National Children's Bureau (who 
      run the Sex Education Forum). 

      <p>In a survey commissioned by the Forum, 83 percent of parents of 
      school-aged children said that they thought schools should teach young 
      people about the emotional as well as the biological aspects of sex.  77 
      percent said that PSHE should be a compulsory part of the curriculum. 

      <p>“There is a clear groundswell of support for making PSHE compulsory within 
      schools,” said Anna Martinez, co-ordinator of the Sex education Forum. 
      “Both young people and their parents have repeatedly told us that they 
      want better school-based sex and relationships education, which meets

      <h>Hundreds of HIV+ Africans facing deportation19th May 2006
       
      <p>The British Home Office has caused an outcry among AIDS organisations and 
      Human Rights groups by declaring that an HIV+ status is not a sufficient 
      reason to allow illegal immigrants to stay in Britain. 

      <p>Ministers are concerned that allowing illegal immigrants with HIV to 
      remain in the UK will set a precedent and encourage ‘health tourism’, 
      whereby people living with HIV come to the UK specifically to access 
      antiretroviral medical treatment. 

      <p>AIDS charities dispute the claim that health tourism is a significant 
      problem however, and argue that sending HIV+ people back to countries in 
      Africa that do not yet have established networks of antiretroviral drug 
      provision is tantamount to handing them a death sentence. 

      <p>“We're seeing appalling hypocrisy from the Government,” said Ruth Bundy, a 
      solicitor for several immigrants with HIV and AIDS.  “On the one hand it 
      is extending monetary aid to Africa to help 'make poverty history'. 
      Simultaneously though, it is throwing out individuals who have no hope of 
      medical treatment in their home countries and are therefore being sent 
      home to die." 

      <p>Lisa Power of the Terrence Higgins Trust (who advocate on behalf of many 
      HIV+ illegal immigrants) suggested a simple solution would be to allow 
      illegal immigrants to stay for five years, by which time antiretrovirals 
      should be more widely available in Africa. 

      <p>The latest decision by the Home Office follows on from a ruling made in 
      November 2005, when a judge rejected the appeal of an HIV+ woman from 
      Zimbabwe.  The totalitarian rule of Robert Mugabe has thrown Zimbabwe into 
      the depths of a humanitarian crisis, with ballooning inflation rates and 
      foreign currency shortages meaning HIV treatment is almost completely 
      unobtainable, even to those with money.  To return her to the country 
      therefore meant almost certain death, but the judge ruled that under UK 
      law, she had no case.  The government's decision means many more could now 
      suffer the same fate. 

      <p>Tom McNulty, the minister for Immigration has promised to readdress the 
      issue of HIV+ immigrants, but told a recent group of charity 
      representatives and solicitors that giving people with HIV special 
      priority when it came to making decisions on deportation would "seem 
      unfair to those suffering from other serious medical conditions, both 
      physical and mental." 

      <p>Under UK law, illegal immigrants are required to pay for treatment from 
      the NHS, although it is thought many are treated by sympathetic doctors 
      for free.

      <h>The Independent goes RED for world health15th May 2006
       
      <p>The British newspaper The Independent is to be edited by the rockstar Bono 
      tomorrow, who plans to use his editorship to promote awareness of 
      international development issues and raise money for the Global Fund to 
      fight AIDS, TB and Malaria. 

      <p>Bono, the lead singer of the band U2, has a long history of campaigning on 
      humanitarian issues, but this is the first time he has ever edited a 
      newspaper for the cause.  Reports say he has commissioned a number of 
      articles on Africa, AIDS and other health issues, and has even asked the 
      US Secretary of State, Condelezza Rice, to write an article on her top-ten 
      favourite pieces of music. 

      <p>Half of all sales of the paper will go to the Global Fund through the RED 
      corporate branding scheme that was set up by Bono and the American 
      philanthropist Bobby Shriver earlier in the year.  The Fund is currently 
      facing a severe funding shortage due to a fall in international donor 
      support and a rise in the number of funding applications being granted in 
      resource-poor countries. 

      <p>Commenting on Bono’s role as editor, Simon Kelner, the regular editor of 
      The Independent, said: "We are delighted to be involved with RED, and I am 
      thrilled to be handing over the editor's desk for a day to Bono. His 
      perspective on world affairs is unique… [and] I am certain that the paper 
      he will produce for tomorrow will be, in the traditions of The 
      Independent, challenging, entertaining and illuminating." 

      <p>The Independent is the first media organisation to join the RED campaign.  
      At present, commercial partners include Converse, Giorgio Armani, Gap, 
      American Express, and the mobile telephone manufacturer Motorola, who 
      today announced that it would be launching a RED phone.  Like the other 
      products produced by the RED partner organisations, part of the proceeds 
      of every sale of a RED phone will go to the Global Fund. 

      <p>It is also rumoured that the four major UK mobile phone networks (namely 
      Orange, O2, Vodafone and T-Mobile) will soon be participating in the 
      scheme, although an official announcement confirming this has not yet been 
      made. 

      <p>RED is broadly supported by most AIDS, malaria and TB organisations, 
      although some, including AVERT, have criticised press reports that imply 
      that buying RED products is the best way to fight AIDS in Africa.  Money 
      given to the Global Fund (including corporate donations given through RED) 
      is donated on an entirely 'no-strings' attached basis and can be used in 
      any number of international projects fighting disease.  This means 
      proceeds from the sale of a pair of RED converse trainers may equally go 
      to fight TB in Russia or Malaria in Nicaragua as to combat AIDS in 
      Mozambique. 

      <p>There have also been concerns that people have a misconception about the 
      proportion of the cost of a product that actually goes to the Fund.  RED's 
      retail partners have promised to donate a 'significant' portion of the 
      profit (rather than the entire sale price) they make on a product, but how 
      much this is likely to be has not yet been confirmed.  Amex have said 1% 
      of all purchases charges to the RED credit card every month will go to 
      fighting AIDS, TB and Malaria, which works out as £1 for every £100 spent. 


      <p>The current scale of the RED scheme means initial funds raised are likely 
      to be small.  However the high profile of the scheme means there is 
      potential for major international donors may be detered from contributing 
      more under the false belief that their money is no longer quite as 
      urgently needed. 

      <p>RED is undoubtably an excellent way of raising awareness of the Global 
      Fund, which has until now has kept a relatively low profile.  It is also a 
      very useful way of engaging the commercial sector, a previously untapped 
      source of funds.  But it should not be touted as an easy answer to AIDS in 
      Africa, nor should it be allowed to discourage people from donating out of 
      their own pockets to charities that directly fight HIV around the world.
