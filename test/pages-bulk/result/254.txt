                  <p>COLOMBO - Harindra Joseph Fernando returns today to his 
                  tsunami-stricken native Sri Lanka to practice the cool 
                  disciplines of science while, in a living hell around him, 
                  thousands of suffering countrymen cry out for compassion.

                  <p>But out of the team's work, out of their science, may come 
                  compassion and even protection from another disaster, he 
                  believes.

                  <p>Arizona State University professor Fernando, 49, a mechanical 
                  engineer and expert on fluid dynamics, will join a team of 
                  other wave experts sponsored by the U.S. National Science 
                  Foundation. They will spend a week in the hardest hit areas of 
                  the country where about 30,000 people were killed by gigantic 
                  waves that struck Dec. 26. advertisement




                  <p>While relief efforts go on all around them, the researchers 
                  will interview eyewitnesses to the monster waves to learn how 
                  big they seemed, how fast they moved, how hard they hit. They 
                  will use surveying equipment to measure beach erosion and they 
                  will climb palm trees to investigate how high the water rose.

                  <p>"We are mostly interested in the power of the water flow and 
                  effect of the power on structures,'' Fernando said. "How far 
                  did the water go into the land? We are also very interested in 
                  finding why some areas were hit and others not.''

                  <p>Team leader Philip Liu, a professor at Cornell University, 
                  helped create a computer model of tsunami behavior that the 
                  team wants to test. 

                  <p>"It seeks to predict where the land will be inundated,'' 
                  Fernando said. "The model showed that for some strange reason 
                  (the Sri Lankan city) Galle would be effected even though it's 
                  on the west coast. Well, the wave did, in fact, behave as the 
                  model predicted; it devastated Galle. We want to know why.''

                  <p>Fernando knows the area well. He grew up in Moratuwa, only 
                  about 50 miles away. 

                  <p>He says that as a child he would walk with his father, a civil 
                  servant, out of their middle income neighborhood about a 
                  quarter mile from the sea and past the shanties of the poor 
                  who live only yards from the beach. There Fernando watched the 
                  waves.

                  <p>"I would feel the wind blowing off the water, see the waves 
                  breaking one after another, and I was fascinated by them,'' 
                  Fernando said. "I wanted to know about those waves.''

                  <p>After secondary school and getting an undergraduate degree in 
                  mechanical engineering in Sri Lanka, Fernando in 1980 
                  communicated with Johns Hopkins University about his desire to 
                  study the theory of waves.

                  <p>"The university gave me a fellowship that covered my tuition 
                  and I got a research assistantship,'' he said. "It was a 
                  wonderful thing and I applied myself to my work there very, 
                  very hard. I got a master's and a Ph.D in two and half years. 
                  Quick. I had a lot of interest.''

                  <p>His interest was in pure science, but it was in application, 
                  too.

                  <p>"I studied the fluid dynamics of waves, which is the melding 
                  point between science and technology,'' Fernando said. "You do 
                  science and you do application.''

                  <p>Application that people in the military are interested in. Or 
                  countries with coastal cities threatened by wave erosion or 
                  inundation. Application of theory that can attract big grant 
                  dollars.

                  <p>So when Fernando applied to ASU in 1984 the school snapped him 
                  up, got him tenured in four years instead of the usual six, 
                  created a new Environmental Fluid Dynamics program and made 
                  Fernando the director.

                  <p>He now brings in about $1.5 million in grants each year. The 
                  U.S. Navy wants information on how certain kinds of waves will 
                  affect certain kinds of submarines. Fernando and his staff 
                  research the matter and tell them. The Arizona Department of 
                  Environmental Quality wants to know how currents of air will 
                  move pollution around. They go to Fernando.

                  <p>Though busy with his university work, Fernando has taken time 
                  to nurture, with wife Ravini, a large family. They live in 
                  Chandler. Their son Ravi is a senior at Brophy College 
                  Preparatory Academy; sons Sahan and Shenal attend Mount Carmel 
                  School in Tempe. Daughter Thilini, 4, stays home with mom.

                  <p>Fernando says he will be thinking of his family often while he 
                  is in Sri Lanka - and thinking of the many people he knew who 
                  were swept away to their deaths.

                  <p>"It was terrible, terrible, but in our work, in our purpose, 
                  we will find a silver lining,'' Fernando said. 

                  <p>A part of that silver lining will be if the team can further 
                  refine a computer model to predict inundation areas when an 
                  undersea earthquake triggers huge waves.

                  <p>"It's too hard to evacuate an entire coastal area, and often 
                  not necessary; if we can tell a government to get helicopters 
                  to these six or seven places and get the people out, then that 
                  can work and could save many lives,'' he said. "If we can 
                  accurately predict where the worst hit area of a country will 
                  be, that would be a very important part of a better warning 
                  system than we have now.''

                  <p>Fernando says that if the research the team does can help 
                  governments find ways to prevent such a disaster from 
                  happening again, "Then we will have found our silver lining.'' 


                  <p>And ASU will, according to President Michael Crow, have played 
                  a proud part of helping avert future disasters.

                  <p>"Sri Lanka has given us Joe Fernando, one of the world's 
                  experts in oceanic-wave theory," Crow said. "It's incredibly 
                  fitting that he return to Sri Lanka to help design an early 
                  warning system that will save the lives of future 
                  generations."
