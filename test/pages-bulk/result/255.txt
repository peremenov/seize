                  <p>If eyes are the window to the soul then the skin around them 
                  is the true confession of age, stress, eating habits, and 
                  more. This unfortunate fact is the result of the eye's minimal 
                  support structure. "The tissue around the eye is the 
                  shallowest tissue on the face. And because it does not have 
                  oil glands or a fatty layer, it is more susceptible to 
                  wrinkles and the effects of aging," says Michelle Ribadeneira, 
                  a former Estee Lauder beauty advisor.

                  <p>Skin care professionals agree that products specifically 
                  created for the eyes are the only way to treat the delicate 
                  area. Says Ribadeneira, "Traditional face products are too 
                  heavy for the eye, as a result they clog pores and create bags 
                  and wrinkles."

                        for at least 15 minutes (word has it playing Enya in the 
                        background always helps) and viola! dark circles and

                        <h>Spa guide:







                  <p>A slew of eye care solutions are available, and they generally 
                  come in gels and creams. While gels do not pack as much 
                  moisturizing power as creams, they're a better choice for 
                  some. "People with oily skin, sensitive skin or acne should 
                  look for an eye gel," says Christina Cusumeno, aesthetician 
                  and skin care specialist for Faline's Skin Boutique in 
                  Scottsdale.

                  <p>Consult a skin care expert to determine your skin type, but 
                  buyer beware, advises Ribadeneira. "Don't be limited by the 
                  brand a skin care specialist's spa or dermatologist sells; 
                  know what your specific needs are," she said. 

                  <h>What to buy
                  <p>Cusumeno suggests products with chamomile for tired, puffy 
                  eyes and products with kojic (a plant derived acid) to relieve 
                  dark circles or create lightning and brightening. But she too 
                  adds a second important warning: Stay clear of products 
                  containing coal-tar colors (listed as FD & C or D & C on the 
                  label); this ingredient is prohibited by the Food and Drug 
                  Administration, in large part because it can lead to 
blindness.

                  <h>Double dippers beware
                  <p>Once the perfect eye care product is found, learn to apply it 
                  correctly for optimal benefits. The first rule, according to 
                  Ribadeneira, is to use the product every morning and night. 
                  "Just like a diet, if you only eat well and exercise 
                  occasionally, results won't come." With consistent care, 
                  Ribadeneira says, you can expect to see changes within six to 
                  nine weeks.

                  <p>The eye area is high in bacteria, making sanitary application 
                  vital as well. Pop the top off a Q-tip, dab a pin-prick amount 
                  on the applicator and pat lightly around the lower eye area 
                  (and sometimes the lips but never the lids) from corner to 
                  corner in a half-moon shape. "Some products come with 
                  spatulas, but I prefer disposable Q-tips because they don't 
                  tempt double-dipping," says Ribadeneira.
