            <p>The health and safety of your pet(s) is a priority with Baby 
            Feathers, LLC. That is why we urge all owners to please supervise 
            your pet when introducing a new toy. We take pride in the care and 
            thought put into every toy and the supplies sold and/or promoted to 
            ensure they are as safe as possible. However, even the safest, 
            simplest toy can pose a threat. It is up to you, as their guardian, 
            to use discretion if a particular toy is right for your pet.  
            Please, keep your pet healthy and safe in mind when introducing new 
            items into their environment.  Remember to always consult with your 
            veterinarian professional before changing or adding to their diets 
            or environments.
            <p>Baby Feathers, LLC is not responsible for any harm, or mishaps due 
            to use of lighting, burning, melting or simmering of candles, 
            incense or using oils, melters or tarts. Please keep these safety 
            tips in mind when using any candle, open flame or any scented 
            product for that matter: Never leave a burning candle unattended! 
              <p>Please take special care when using candles, melts, tarts or any 
              scented products around children, pets and especially around birds 
              and parrots. Do not place near flammable objects such as curtains, 
              walls, etc. Place only on a protected, heat resistant, level 
              surface. Keep candle free of wick trimmings, matches, or other 
              foreign matter that could be a fire hazard. Avoid burning in 
              drafts. This will cause candle to burn more quickly and unevenly. 
              Please never walk around with lit candles. Please trim wicks to 
              1/4 inch at all times to avoid carbon build up on the wick. 
              <p>Some of the tart burners/melters, simmer pots, potpourri burners 
              etc. on the market are not suitable for the intended use. Please 
              take special care when using these products. Never use any of 
              these left untended nor use around children and pets, especially 
              birds and parrots! Make sure the tea light candle is a good 
              distance from the underside of the burner where the wax is. If the 
              wax gets too hot, the burner can be come over heated and cause the 
              aroma to burn away to fast and may cause safety issues. It is our 
              opinion that the tea light or heat source should be no less than 
              2.5" from the holder. When using scented oils you must always add 
              water to the oil in the dish. Make sure you keep adding water as 
              it will evaporate. If water is NOT added, the dish may crack. Try 
              to use wax melts/tart not the oils as you should not have the 
              worry over adding the extra water.
