      <h>Chicken Noodle Soup for Low Back Pain 
      <p>About 80% of people will experience a significant bout of low back pain at 
      some point during their lifetime. Many of these people will have several 
      episodes of significant back pain, and some will go on to develop back 
      pain that bothers them on an almost daily basis. Most back pain develops 
      suddenly after lifting a heavy object or spraining the muscles in the back 
      during vigorous exercise. Another common cause of back pain is poor 
      posture at work or during prolonged periods of sitting. This type of back 
      pain is often the result of the muscles that support the spinal column 
      becoming weaker over time. Doctors refer to this type of weakness as 
      "deconditioning," which describes the body's natural response to 
      inactivity and little exercise. As the muscles that support the spine and 
      trunk become weaker, they are less able to withstand heavy lifting, or 
      support the spine in its normal position, and as a result, the entire back 
      becomes sore and tired. Exercise is the best way to prevent this type of 
      pain from occurring.
      <p>Several studies have shown that regular cardiovascular exercise, like 
      swimming, bicycling, jogging, or hiking, is the most beneficial form of 
      exercise for treating and preventing back pain. This type of exercise, 
      which promotes good health in general, has been shown to be as effective 
      as nearly every other type of physical therapy program or exercise regime. 
      In addition, this is the type of exercise that is easy to do, enjoyable, 
      and definitely good for you. If you can find the time for half an hour or 
      an hour of brisk walking, bicycling, or jogging several times a week, your 
      back will thank you for it for the rest of your life.
      <p>Telling you that regular exercise has a positive effect on low back pain 
      is a bit like providing you with "chicken soup" advice; meaning that your 
      mother probably could have told you that maintaining a strong and healthy 
      back would be good for you. The reality is a bit more complicated. Most 
      people don't know where to begin, they may be afraid they will hurt their 
      back further, and once they get started, they often give up too early. To 
      make matters worse, many people are already overweight, out of shape, and 
      have developed habits and lifestyles that are inherently unhealthy.
      <p>Once I start, how can I avoid giving up?
      Most people who start a regular exercise program give it up after a short 
      period of time. While there are a lot of reasons that they choose to stop 
      exercising regularly, they often boil down to a few simple reasons. Its 
      often hard to find the time to exercise, the motivation to get out there 
      starts to slip after a while, and its easy to slip back into old routines. 
      In order to avoid this from happening to you, here a few simple 
      suggestions:
      <p>Find ways to incorporate exercise into your daily routine. 
      Ride your bike to work once a week. If you can't ride your bike to work, 
      park in the farthest parking spot possible and walk around the building 
      once before starting your day. Take the stairs. The amount of exercise 
      that simple modifications to your daily routine like these add up to over 
      the course of a year can be very impressive. Once you start this type of a 
      routine, it is often easier to stick with than the idea of driving to the 
      gym for half an hour everyday after work.
      <p>Find a partner and create common goals. 
      When your motivation starts to slip, having a partner who will drag you 
      outside can be a lifesaver. This type of a partnership is often better if 
      you have similar goals in terms of weight loss, healthy eating habits, and 
      the amount of exercise that you want to work up to. Chose someone who 
      lives close by, perhaps even your spouse, and write your goals down. Put 
      specific dates and amounts in your plan for increasing the amount of 
      exercise that you want to do together. Think of ways to reward yourselves 
      when you meet your goals, and write them down.
      <p>If all else fails, pay someone else to motivate you. 
      Personal trainers have become very popular, and the primary reason is that 
      they keep track of your progress, give you lots of encouragement, and they 
      schedule your workouts for you. While they can be intimidating at first, 
      since many of them are impossibly fit young specimens in tight shorts and 
      a tank top, they can be an incredible resource. Find one that you like, 
      pay for a couple of months up front, and you'll be amazed at how much 
      progress you'll make over time.
      <p>Why is exercise good for the spine?
      While many doctors (and also your mother) will tell you that exercise is 
      definitely an important part of your overall good health and well-being, 
      many people who have a sore back think of exercise as the last thing that 
      they would want to do, and they often wonder how exercise would make a 
      painful back feel better. Think of the muscles of the trunk and spine as 
      being analogous to the supporting wires of a sailboat mast. If the mast 
      does not have any supporting wires, it is very flimsy and likely to topple 
      over. Without any support, it will be unable to withstand the forces of 
      the wind in the sails and the entire structure is likely to fail. The 
      muscles that surround the spinal column serve a similar purpose. They help 
      to balance the spine during normal activities and athletic exercise and 
      prevent the weight of the body from being carried by the spine in a 
      harmful way. The stronger and better conditioned these muscles are, the 
      more support there is for the spine, which results in better balancing of 
      the loads that the spine must carry during daily life.
      <p>Unfortunately, when people develop back pain, they have a tendency to want 
      to avoid all types of exercise, and become more sedentary rather than more 
      active. This can become a bit of a vicious cycle, because avoiding 
      exercise when your back hurts causes the muscles of your back to become 
      weaker and weaker, which makes them even more susceptible to injury.
      <p>This is not to say that you need to run a marathon the day after you 
      strained your back while moving into your new home. However, as doctors 
      have learned more and more about the causes and treatment of acute back 
      pain, they have prescribed shorter and shorter periods of rest immediately 
      after developing a back strain. In the past, people used to be advised to 
      spend a significant amount of time in bed, waiting for their back to feel 
      better. Today, we recognize that the best treatment for a back sprain or 
      strain is early mobilization and a relatively rapid return to normal 
      activities. Most doctors recommend a brief period of rest, generally one 
      or two days, during which most patients are advised to take a course of 
      anti-inflammatory medications in order to help reduce the pain and 
      inflammation. After this period of rest, it is generally advisable to 
      return to your normal activities and also begin gently exercising, 
      especially walking or swimming, in order to stretch out your muscles and 
      help them to recover. As soon as possible, you should restart your regular 
      exercise regime, especially those exercises that have been specifically 
      designed to help stabilize the trunk and spine. Click here for some common 
      exercises for the spine that are presented in a graduated order, so that 
      you can start with the easy ones and work your way up to the more 
      difficult ones as you are able.
