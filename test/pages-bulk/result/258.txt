<p>Blueberries are a popular early summer small fruit. Successful blueberry 
marketing requires that the fruit not only be of very high quality but that it 
also be properly packaged and thoroughly cooled. This publication explains the 
postharvest handling procedures necessary to deliver North Carolina blueberries 
of the highest quality.
<p>Most consumers purchase fresh blue-berries on impulse and are prompted primarily 
by the perception of quality. Wholesale buyers also associate appearance and 
firmness with fruit quality and freshness. Successful blueberry marketing thus 
requires that the fruit be of the highest quality and appearance. However, 
blueberries are extremely perishable and easily damaged by rough handling and 
adverse temperatures. Because blue-berries are often harvested and handled 
during hot, humid weather, attention to proper postharvest handling is essential 
to maintaining quality.
<h>Harvesting
<p>Blueberries of the highbush type (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) and the rabbiteye 
type (Vaccinium ashei Read) are grown in North Carolina. More than 90 percent of 
the blueberries produced commercially are of the highbush type. Harvesting of 
highbush blueberries begins in late May and often continues through late June. 
Rabbiteye varieties ripen in late June, and harvesting continues into August. 
Blueberries, even those growing on the same bush, do not all ripen at the same 
time. Under normal growing conditions, blueberries ripen over a period of three 
to four weeks. Ripe blueberries should have a completely uniform blue color. 
Fruit with a red tinge are less mature and will not be as sweet as more mature 
berries even though they ship well and will turn completely blue within several 
days. Depending upon the crop and the weather conditions, blueberry fields may 
be harvested as many as four times in intervals of five to seven days. For 
rabbiteye varieties the interval between harvests may be as long as nine days in 
cool dry weather. Harvesting more frequently may not make efficient use of 
labor, whereas less frequent harvesting may result in a high percentage of 
overripe fruit.
<p>In general, high temperatures during blueberry harvest season promote ripening. 
Heavy rains during periods of high temperature can further hasten ripening, 
cause splitting, and greatly reduce storage quality. When picking labor is 
limited, prime fruit may easily become overripe. Overripe blueberries are 
extremely easy to damage. Blueberries that don t look too bad when picked may be 
totally unacceptable when they reach the consumer. Be careful! Price, and 
particularly reputations, depend largely on quality. Once damaged, your 
reputation and that of your marketing organization may be very difficult to 
repair. Consumers long remember experiences with a poor quality product.
<p>Whenever possible, avoid harvesting wet blueberries. Wet berries are very 
susceptible to decay organisms and often resemble overripe berries leaking 
juice. Waiting a few hours to begin harvesting after a rain or heavy dew can 
significantly reduce the chance of infection by postharvest disease organisms 
and can improve the appearance of the fruit. 
<h>Manual Harvesting
<p>Proper instruction and careful supervision of the picking crew is essential to 
the success of any harvesting operation. Postharvest quality control begins in 
the field. Packing house problems and buyer complaints are often the result of 
poorly trained and supervised pickers. Have a responsible person supervise the 
pickers at all times. If the fruit is harvested directly into pint cups, it is a 
good idea to check one or two pints at random in each flat. This check can be 
made easily by emptying the contents of a pint cup into a shallow pan where each 
berry can be examined individually. Finding more than 6 to 8 percent 
poor-quality fruit per pint indicates a need for greater quality control.
<p>Ripe blueberries are easily removed from the bush. Fruit should be removed with 
the thumb and forefinger, keeping the hand cupped under the berry to avoid 
dropping it. The whitish, dusty appearance (bloom) of the blueberry is highly 
desirable, and consumers regard it as a sign of quality. Overhandling the 
berries will remove the bloom. In addition, all workers should be reminded that 
they are handling a food product that is eaten fresh and often not washed. Clean 
hands and sanitary personal habits are required at all times.
<p>Harvested blueberries should never be allowed to remain in the sun. The dark 
berries will readily absorb heat. If berries are picked into buckets, the 
buckets should be no larger than 5 quarts and of rigid construction to minimize 
mashing and the accumulation of respiration heat.
<h>Rules for Blueberry Pickers 



  <l>Keep your hands clean. Remember that you are handling a food product. The law 
  requires you to wash your hands after each visit to the rest station. 
  <l>Pick all the ripe blueberries on the bush before moving on to the next bush. 
  <l>Harvest only well-ripened fruit. Leave immature fruit for the next harvest. 
  <l>Place your hand under the clusters to avoid dropping the berries. 
  <l>Avoid overfilling your hands; do not squeeze or roll the fruit. 
  <l>Do not put trash or cull berries into the container. 
  <l>Never allow harvested fruit to remain in the sun. 
<h>Mechanical Harvesting
<p>Recurring labor problems have prompted some blueberry growers to investigate 
mechanical harvesting. The major advantage is a significant reduction in 
management and labor costs. Savings in labor costs of 30 to 45 percent have been 
reported. One mechanical harvester can replace as many as 100 manual pickers. 
Over-the-row mechanical blueberry harvesters have been available since the 
mid-sixties. These machines have been primarily of the shake-and-catch design, 
which detach the blueberries by shaking or vibrating the bush. The fruit drops 
onto a capturing device and conveyor, on which it is moved past an air-blast 
cleaner and finally into field lugs.
<p>Even if carefully adjusted and operated, mechanical harvesters will harvest a 
significant amount of unacceptable fruit. These machines have no means of 
detecting quality and will harvest immature, overripe, diseased, and damaged 
fruit that would ordinarily be discarded by a human picker. The elimination of 
this unacceptable fruit and foreign matter is difficult and expensive, and it 
requires that the berries be handled excessively. A mechanical harvester and the 
required sorting machines often subject the fruit to excessive damage. Overripe 
fruit, in particular, is easily damaged by these machines. Any additional 
handling adversely affects the shelf life and quality of the blueberries.
<p>Although a significant percentage of the blue-berries grown worldwide are 
harvested by machine, most North Carolina growers strive to produce fruit for 
the higher-valued fresh market. Mechanically harvest-ed blueberries are 
generally considered unfit for the fresh market and are therefore usually frozen 
for processing.
<h>Rules for Minimizing Damage to Fruit by Mechanical Harvesting 



  <l>Harvest only dry fruit in the coolest part of the day. 
  <l>Minimize the drop heights on the machine and pad the impact surfaces. 
  <l>Eliminate as much vibration as possible. 
  <l>Limit the depth of harvested fruit in the field containers to 4 or 5 inches. 
  <l>Handle and dump field containers very gently. 
  <l>Cool the fruit as soon as possible after harvest. 
<h>Sorting and Packing
<p>Sorting harvested blueberries intended for the fresh market is time consuming, 
expensive, and damaging to the fruit. Therefore, this practice is generally not 
recommended. The best time to remove defective berries is during manual 
harvesting, thus minimizing handling. For machine-harvested blueberries, there 
may be no alternative but to remove trash and defects on a grading line. When a 
grading line must be used, it should be operated in such a way as to minimize 
mechanical damage.
<p>Whether blueberries are mechanically or manually harvested, every effort should 
be made to keep the percentage of defective fruit to an absolute minimum. 
Seriously defective fruit may include those with insect damage, broken skin, 
decay or mold, attached stems, fruit remaining in clusters, and fruit that is 
overripe, underripe, shriveled, or off-color. U.S. Number 1 is the only 
specified grade for harvested blueberries. Blueberries grading U.S. Number 1 may 
have no more than 1 percent serious defects and no more than 13 percent total 
defects. However, in practice and especially with fresh-market blueberries 
buyers may require less than 5 percent total defective fruit.
<p>Most buyers prefer large fruit over small fruit if they are of good quality. The 
U.S. Number 1 grade specifies that the count of berries per 1/2-pint container 
must not exceed 250. Within the U.S. Number 1 classification there are four size 
classifications, as listed in Table 1.
<h>Table 1. USDA Standard Blueberry Size Classifications - U.S. Number 1 



<p>Extra large ........... Fewer than 90 berries per 1/2-pint cup
<p>Large ..................... 90 to 129 berries per 1/2-pint cup
<p>Medium ................... 130 to 189 berries per 1/2-pint cup
<p>Small ..................... 90 to 250 berries per 1/2-pint cup

<p>For the complete USDA standard classifications for blueberries, refer to 46 FR 
63203 or the latest revision.
<p>Almost all North Carolina fresh-market blueberries are marketed in 
cellophane-covered pint containers shipped in 12-pint master containers known as 
flats. Flats may be conveniently stacked, six to a layer, on a standard 
40-by-48- inch shipping pallet (Figure 1). A pallet of blueberries customarily 
consists of 96 flats (1,152 pints) with a gross weight of approximately 1,200 
pounds.

cooling and shipping facility.
<h>Cooling
<p>At warm field temperatures, harvested blueberries are extremely perishable and 
decline rapidly in quality. Visible signs of decay organisms can develop on 
warm, wet blueberries in less than 12 hours. The most common blueberry 
postharvest decay organisms in North Carolina are Alternaria tenuissima 
(Alternaria rot) and Botrytis cinerea (gray mold). In situations where 
blueberries are wet and the risk of decay is high, a rinse in chlorinated water 
(75 to 125 ppm available chlorine) has been successful in controlling these 
diseases. However, chlorination is a preventive measure only. It will not 
salvage fruit already infected because it cannot kill microorganisms that are 
already below the surface. Moreover, chlorination cannot be used for 
fresh-market fruit because the chlorine completely removes the bloom and 
bleaches the fruit.
<p>Decay organisms are very active when the fruit is warm but become much less 
active at lower temperatures. Warm, overripe blueberries, leaking juice from 
rough handling, provide an ideal site for various postharvest decays. Shelf- 
life experiments with packaged blueberries have demonstrated the dramatic 
reductions in decay possible with rapid and thorough cooling. Figure 2 
illustrates the effect of cooling in reducing decay.

<p>Figure 2. Percentage of decay in packaged blueberries stored at various 
temperature.
<p>Harvested blueberries should be cooled as soon as possible but always within 4 
hours of harvest, if possible. This may require more than one pickup or trip to 
the cooling facility during a day of harvesting. However, the increase in shelf 
life and overall quality will make it worthwhile. No fruit, particularly 
well-ripened fruit, should ever be held all day without cooling.
<p>Blueberries remain alive after harvest, respiring and producing heat. At a 
temperature of 80 F, blueberries can produce as much as 22,000 Btu per ton per 
day from the heat of respiration. Unless this heat is removed by cooling, it can 
cause a rise in temperature of as much as 6 F. Cooling lowers the respiration 
rate, slowing the ripening process and the accompanying inevitable decline in 
quality. The respiration rate of blueberries at 80 F is nearly 20 times the rate 
at 40 F. In other words, blueberries held at 40 F have nearly 20 times the shelf 
life of those held at 80 F. Softening is the most visible physiological damage 
resulting from overripening.
<p>Most North Carolina blueberries in wholesale channels receive some cooling. 
However, a portion may continue to reach the consumer in poor condition as a 
result of insufficient cooling. Often the effectiveness of cooling, not its 
availability, is the deciding factor in quality. Cooling must be thoroughly and 
consistently applied to be effective. The optimum temperature that will ensure 
the longest shelf life is just above freezing: 33 or 34 F.
<p>A pallet of packaged blueberries, initially at 80 F, allowed to remain for an 
hour or so in a cooler without forced ventilation may appear to have cooled 
somewhat. However, only the blueberries on the outside will cool appreciably in 
that length of time. Temperature measurements taken inside cellophane-wrapped 
cups near the center of pallets standing in still air at 44 F have actually 
shown a slight temperature increase during the first hour of cooling. 
Calculations suggest that the center cups of pallets of 80 F blueberries would 
require more than 36 hours to cool to below 50 F. Pallets of hot blueberries 
allowed to stand in a cooler for several hours before shipment without forced 
ventilation will not be cooled significantly nor uniformly. Furthermore, 
numerous tests have shown that refrigerated transports provide little or no 
additional cooling.
<p>In still air, the average cooling rate of pallets of blueberries is slow because 
heat is transferred from the interior only by conduction. The cellophane 
wrappers, the fiber cups, the paperboard flats, and especially the air gaps 
between the cups act as effective insulation, slowing the movement of heat. This 
fact has prompted shippers of many commodities to install equipment inside the 
cooler to force the cold air through the containers, greatly increasing the 
cooling rate. In existing refrigerated rooms not equipped with fans, the 
addition of fans (Figure 3) to move the air is the single most cost-effective 
change possible, provided that the refrigeration system has sufficient capacity 
to remove heat rapidly.

<p>Figure 3. Fan arrangement for forced-air cooling of blueberries
<p>Blueberries cooled with forced air reach the desired storage temperature 
significantly faster than those in still air. In addition, they cool more 
uniformly. Figure 4 shows typical average pulp temperatures for a pallet of 
blueberries in still air and for a pallet in forced air. Forced-air cooling is 
clearly much more rapid than cooling in still air. Depending on the 
circumstances, the rate of cooling may be 16 to 20 times faster.

<p>Figure 4. Cooling rates for blueberries in forced air and still air. (Room air 
temperature of 44 F).
<p>Forced-air cooling gives more consistent and thorough cooling through the entire 
pallet load. In situations where a considerable investment has already been made 
in refrigeration equipment and buildings, an additional nominal investment in 
one or more forced-air cooling fans can dramatically reduce the time required to 
cool blueberries satisfactorily, resulting in the delivery of a consistently 
higher quality product to the consumer. For additional information, see 
Cooperative Extension Service publication AG-414-3, Forced-Air Cooling. 
<h>Marketing
<p>Although blueberries are grown commercially in about a dozen states, the major 
supply areas are Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, and the Pacific Northwest 
states. Over the last decade, domestic per capita consumption of blueberries has 
continued to expand at an average annual rate of 4 percent. In 1991, consumption 
of fresh blueberries reached 1/4 pound per person; consumption of processing 
blueberries (in canned and frozen form) was nearly 1/2 pound per person.
<p>Domestic blueberry supplies are most readily available during June, July, and 
August, with July being the peak harvest month. In the past, North Carolina 
producers have enjoyed a timely marketing advantage because they often harvest 
their berries in mid-May and June, earlier than many other competitive supply 
regions. Recently, however, increased plantings of highbush varieties in 
Florida, Georgia, Mississippi and Texas have intensified early-season marketing 
pressures. In addition, more plentiful late-summer low-bush supplies are 
available from Canada.
<p>Local grower prices for blueberries have varied considerably over the past 
decade, with sharp price declines observed in 1985 and 1990. As the supply of 
high-quality berries continues to increase, local growers should continue their 
efforts to provide high-quality, properly cooled blueberries to buyers in order 
to maintain and expand their market share.
