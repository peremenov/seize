<h>Pond at Elmley North Kent Marshes - a secret wilderness
<p>The North Kent Marshes are the Thames Estuary's secret wilderness.

<h>A bird's eye view
<p>As my flight enters the broad mouth of the Thames Estuary, I savour
   the bird's-eye view of this area I know so well. The coastline
   resembles the gaping, dislocated jaws of some fossilised dinosaur that
   once roamed here, but time has rendered it harmless and tides have
   scattered its teeth to form countless islands. My eyes scan the
   pewter-grey mudbanks and mudflats and a distant shoreline etched with
   filigrees of sinuous creeks. My fellow passengers mostly ignore the
   fantastic views, because this isn't a 'must-see' UK destination - and
   yet it's one of those rare places where big skies reach to limitless
   horizons, giving a sense of wilderness, where encountering another
   person is a rare event. And though it looks empty, it teems with
   wildlife.

<p>The estuary narrows and the coastline becomes increasingly
   industrialised. Buildings and chimneys crowd the shores as we descend
   into London. It's good to be reminded I can find an antidote to city
   life on my doorstep, where the 'Garden of England' hides its wild
   nature.

<h>Complex area
<p>The North Kent Marshes is a complex area extending from Gravesend to
   Whitstable. Their beauty is an acquired taste - often bleak and
   unwelcoming, they lack the chocolate-box charms of the North Downs,
   and the horizon is punctuated by exclamation marks from power-station
   chimneys. Their natural resources have been exploited since Roman
   times, and the flotsam and jetsam of human enterprise have left areas
   of dereliction that are surprisingly species-rich - who would believe
   that rare ants, bees and wasps favour such places? And, despite
   industrialisation, large areas are wild and seldom explored.

<h>Worth staying a while
<p>The marshes can be visited in a day from London, but they don't reveal
   themselves easily. For a longer stay, choose Rochester as a base. From
   here, you'll find that cycling and walking is the way to penetrate the
   best wildlife areas. It takes four days to walk along the Saxon Shore
   Way from Gravesend to Whitstable (cyclists can follow the National
   Cycle Route), but it's more rewarding to make diversions and dip in
   and out as the fancy takes. I have selected three locations to give a
   taste of the main habitats in the area.

<h>Further information
<p>North Kent Marshes is under threat from a plan to build a four-runway
   airport twice the size of Heathrow at Cliffe. According to the
   proposals, the tens of thousands of birds that come here to feed and
   breed will be "discouraged" from a 26km diameter exclusion zone around
   the airport. Whether this will be possible is open to question. The
   danger of bird-strike has been dismissed by developers as "problematic
   but not insurmountable." Cliffe airport will be a most important test
   case for the Government's commitment to conservation. The consultation
   period on the proposal ends on 30 June.

<h>Tide tables
<p>Invaluable for exploring Kent's marshes. Available from Medway
   branches of WH Smith and chandlers. Quick Tide South East

<h>Precautions
<p>Be prepared for cold weather. The area attracts wind, and even in
   summer, the estuary can be several degrees cooler than inland. Beware
   of walking on the mudflats at low tide, because there are soft areas
   where it is easy to get stuck. And be aware of the speed of the rising
   tide when exploring areas exposed at low tide; it is easy to become
   marooned. Obtain tide tables or local advice.
