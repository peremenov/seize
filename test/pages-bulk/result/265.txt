<h>Plunkets Restaurant

<h>What's the grub like, then?

<p>Ordered nachos as starters which they forgot to bring until the main
   course. Fajitas were only average. I was expecting them to arrive
   sizzling hot but they weren't so the food was only lukewarm.
<h>What did you drink?
<p>Bottle of house white at about £13 was okay.
<h>What's the crowd like?
<p>Arrived about 7pm on a Monday night so had a
   choice of tables. Got quite full later on.
<h>And the vibe?
<p>Nice building but tables were a bit cramped and the
   chairs uncomfortable. The couple at the next table started smoking so
   it was time to skip dessert and coffee and leave.
<h>Anything else you'd like to say?
<p>Overall disappointing. Seem to be
   trading on reputation alone. There are plenty of better options in
   York.
<h>Value for money?
<p>£53 for 3 mains and wine. They didn't charge for the
   starters.
<p>If I was being generous I'd say it was fair. However, if I was more
   honest, I'd say overrated. But my problem wasn't with the food.
<p>Bottled beer and house wine. Slightly pricey, but
   tasted nice.
<p>Couples of all ages.
<p>Crowded and smokey upstairs
<p>Was told you cant book, so turned up
   without a reservation and had to wait two hours for a table. When we
   were finally seated, we noticed many tables were unused. Upstairs the
   bar was packed full of people waiting for tables and downstairs there
   were LOTS of tables unused? I got the feeling they were just ushering
   customers upstairs for an hour or two to get a few extra rounds of
   drinks out of them. Very annoying! Not in a rush to return!
<p>I paid £8 for a plate of nachos chips with a couple
   of dollops of salsa for a starter.
<p>Plunketts is part of a Christmas tradition with us. We first visited
   years ago and have returned regularly (always at Christmas time) on
   our (at least) biennial shopping visit to York. The food is always
   excellent and the steaks are cooked just how you order them. I can
   also speak very highly of the 'bowl'o'red'! This time round we tried
   the Christmas cake and Godminster for dessert, and for a strictly
   Cheddar-only man like me this was a real treat - Fantastic! However
   having since purchased some of the aforementioned cheese I have been
   disappointed not to be able to achieve the same kick.
<p>Black Sheep. Its as much a part of the tradition
   as admiring the view through the bedsit window across the street from
   upstairs, or banging my head on the low beams.
<p>Sadly the clientele appear to be getting
   younger; I say 'appear' because I am a realist and suspect that age
   wise I now have more in common with the fabric of the building than
   some of the punters!
<p>Soapbox time! Apart from it's everpresent inbuilt charm
   and ambience, on this occassion I was put off (upstairs at least) by
   the fug of smoke. The truth is I don't often get out these days and to
   have an evening as special as this marred (not exactly spoiled) by
   something as blatantly antisocial (its only social to those who enjoy
   it) was a tad upsetting. No doubting where I stand on the great debate
   then!
<p>If you should visit in the week
   before Christmas be sure to have a seat next to the roaring fire! Only
   my wife likes to sit next to the window in the bar to see the Minster
   - so do I, of course!
<p>Always! We shared the dessert and still couldn't
   manage it!
<p>Amazing! The fajitas were fantasic and the portion was more than
   enough for one person.
<p>the house white is cheap and fruity
<p>The service was spot on no faults at all
<p>chilled out atmosphere and the pictures of all the
   famous people really amazing.
<p>Overall it was great, i will
   reccomend it to all my friends and will certainly go again!
<p>It is about £4.50 for a starter and £10.00 ish for a
   main, well worth it though!
<p>Fanastic. Wide choice and variety. Took a long time to decide what to
   order!
<p>House white, very nice.
<p>We booked for mid afternoon so quiet. A few
   couples, work parties.
<p>Trendy, I could go with a partner or friends. I think it
   has the right setting to make the atmosphere what you want. Lots of
   pictures of famous stars everywhere, great.
<p>Will definately be going again. Staff
   were friendly and the food exceptional.
<p>For 7; 3 courses and drinks it came to £180 which was
   good value for money. Each course was a generous portion only just had
   enough room for desert.
<p>We're sorry to announce that the Greedy Pig has eaten one wafer thin
   mint too many and looks unlikely to recover so this section of the BBC
   North Yorkshire website is now closed. Many thanks to everyone who
   submitted reviews.

<p>Existing reviews will remain on this site for a while as an archive,
   but won't be updated.
