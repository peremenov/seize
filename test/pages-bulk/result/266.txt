<p>One by U2 is the most stunning and beautiful tunes. It has melancholy
   lyrics that are powerfully hopefull, mournfull, deeply personal, and
   touching. The music emotes and soars and lifts your heart up while
   breaking it.
<h>Jed - East Sussex
<p>This is one of the greatest and most moving songs ever written. No
   matter how often you hear it, it never fails to affect you with its
   lyrics and deep emotion. A masterpiece.

<h>James hessle
<p>One song, one album, one band. What a song, what a band, what an
   album. I am hope the repetion of my comment does not bore you. I
   thought it was a intresting way to put the point.

<p>"One" has to be U2's best song. I have been a U2 fan since 1991.
   Achtung Baby was my first U2 album. I have been hooked ever since.
   Every time you listen to this song, it sends shivers down your spine.

<h>Andrew Scully, Edinburgh
<p>I love this one very much. It belongs up there with R.E.M's "Everybody
   Hurts" as being a beautiful yet tearjerking classic. And Johnny Cash's
   version was superb too.

<h>kgallagher manchester
<p>one is a briiliant song and inspiring if you love u2 you will love
   this song

<h>NJH Lobo/ London
<p>What a beautiful song! So brilliant, calming and excellent.

<h>kelly wythenshawe
<p>i think that one was an excellent song and still is its like a story
   of bono trying to say sorry for something a truly excellent track

<h>Sean in Dublin
<p>Is there a vendetta against Johnny Cash? His version was better than
   either of these! Great lyric but Bono drowns it out with an overblown
   performance.

<h>Natalie - Rochester
<p>This song is just amazing no words can do this one or U2 justice !

<h>Elijah May, Krakow
<p>Don't forget Johnny Cash's rendition of "One"....worth a listen.

<h>Scott, Leicester
<p>Haunting yet heartwarming, wound-opening yet healing, somber yet
   blissful.

<h>ian, skipton
<p>classic song' great lyrics great driving tune

<h>jimbo north wales
<p>Bono is the all-time legend. With Or Without You is the no.1 track of
   all time.

<h>alan dickson fae fife
<p>best u2 song man smell the flowers while u still can.

<h>Chris Cole/ Haywards Heath
<p>Not a die hard U2 fan but this is lyrically one of the best. Jonny
   Cash cover is spellbinding, heartbreaking almost especially 'did i ask
   to much, more than a lot, you gave me nothing now it's all I got.'

<h>Kevin Mowatt
<p>Johnny Cash did a version of this song that is on the American 3
   album, I emplore you to listen to this version. Its as good as the
   original.

<h>Martin - Lichfield
<p>Johnny Cash did the best cover version of this song. Without doubt.
   His cover makes you understand what it is really about.

<h>Vicky, Leigh
<p>"One" is a great U2 anthem with all the trademark inspirational lyrics
   and layers of sound you've come to expect from this band. U2 don't
   just tell a story, they create a soundscape which in this case is
   poignant but ultimately uplifting - a celebration of unity in
   diversity.

<h>Eliana Santiago, Chile
<p>I am actually listening this show from down here in Chile and is
   awesome how this song bring tears to your eyes the very moment it
   starts, WOW!

<h>Andrew R.Laing. Glagow
<p>Mr Jonny Cash covered this epic song with his magical acoustic twist,
   long live the ONE

<h>Daniel Haverly Liverpool
<p>Whilst I love U2, you have forgotten Johnny Cash's version which
   brought a raw bitter edge to the song. Fabulous
