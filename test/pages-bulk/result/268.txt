<h>Maisyboo, Cardiff
<p>As a nurse in Cardiff Royal Infirmary I often worked on the night
   shift - here many strange things happened to staff. In the staff room
   one night I heard heavy breathing close to me - other staff who'd been
   in the room had heard it! A nurse was later in the room and something
   sat down on the mattress beside her! In the sluice room we would get
   our uniforms pulled by something unseen! A nurse also saw a ghostly
   apparition floating across the ward. And when the hospital was closed
   finally the call buzzers could be heard even though they had been
   dismantled!!

<h>Stefan from Pontypool
<p>I go to West Mon school and I saw the figure of a small boy running
   around corridors. Then a few days later during an exam some teachers
   were called to the music rooms because a small girl had fainted after
   supposedly seeing a small boy drenched in water standing in front of
   her desk, before disappearing as she blinked. Can anyone tell me
   anything about what happened at West Mon?

<h>Michelle Evans, Penarth
<p>If you walk on Penarth Pier late afternoons, a figure of a women
   dressed in Victorian clothing strolls by you and lurks at the end of
   the pier staring out over the sea. I thought it was a fancy dress
   event, but learned that a Victorian lady oftens haunts the pier.

<h>Kelly Groves from Crawley
<p>My partner and I stayed at the Skirrid Inn for the night and
   encountered some strange happenings. For one we chucked all of our
   jewellery including two necklaces, watch, ring and bracelet on to the
   dresser - minutes later we hear the sound of jingling, look at the
   dresser and the jewellery is neatly arranged. Two, the en suite basin
   tap turns on by itself, three something awakens myself by banging the
   pillow around early hours, and four something or one steels my silver
   earring left on the chair beside myside of the bed. The landlady
   described this as the little boy who likes to hide things including
   her coffee cup!

<h>Lisa, Penarth
<p>I live on the brand new housing estate of the Cogan Hall development
   in Cae Canol and there is some weird stuff going on. I've driven up to
   the church to reserch it.

<h>Rory Jones from Porthcawl
<p>Ive lived in Porthcawl all of my life and there are several places I
   wont even go to they are so creepy. The worst place is definitely Moor
   Lane and Sker Beach. They are such lovely places with nice scenery but
   there is a sinister feeling in the air as if something bad has
   happened.

<h>Dai Rees from Caerphilly
<p>I worked in The Prince of Wales, the Wetherspoons pub near Cardiff
   Central, over the summer of 2006, and the upstairs bar is reputedly
   haunted by a famous actress who died there when it was a theatre. Not
   sure how true the story is, but I thought for a split second I saw a
   dark shape, from the corner of my eye, where the food arrives...
   Anyone ever feel anything?

<h>SJ from Porthcawl
<p>At the age of around 14-16 my friends and I used to often go and spend
   nights by Sker House in the hope of seeing something. And boy did we
   see something!!! It was on our 3rd trip down there when we had all
   been snooping close by to the house (sorry if we were tresspassing)
   but we only managed to get so far as the boundary wall when we could
   hear this faint wailing noise - it could have been the wind but not
   too sure but then we seen a faded figure slightly lighted appear from
   the ruin of the sort of tower closest to the sea. It was enough to
   make us actually go home that night instead of staying out and after
   about 11 years I have not been back since. There are from what I have
   been told sightings at along the rocks between Sker and Kenfig of
   figures reportedly from the wreck of the Sampamta. Also sightings at
   The Prince of Wales in Kenfig, the Angel Inn at Maudlam... Grove Farm
   (opp Grove golf club) is supposed to have a phantom funeral procession
   in the front garden were the old road once was before the existing
   road was built. I have bene told hat a very spooky place is Moor Lane
   at the Nottage side of Porthcawl - not sure if it is haunted or not
   but I have driven down the lane at night and it really isn't something
   that I will do again soon - very creepy. Porthcawl is a very
   mysterious town and have many a tales of hauntings. It is well worth a
   visit there and spending some time in some of the above mentioned
   places.

<h>Stephen Parry originally from Rudry near Caerphill
<p>Not far from the Maenllwyd Inn are the ruins of a house in which a
   witch lived in the mid 1800's. She is supposed to have cursed my
   family. I don't know about that, but on two occasions when I have
   walked up through the woods to the field where the house was I have
   seen no one, but when I started to go back someone had left a bunch of
   flowers on the stile going into the field. This stile is in full view,
   but I have never seen who did it. Strange!!

<h>Samantha Smith (from Ely)
<p>I once got locked in a bedroom where I was living in a house in
   Splott. There was no catch or lock on the door, and when I tried it,
   the handle turned but the door would not open. The door was never
   shut, as it wouldn't stay shut - having no catch. I was locked in
   there for about 10 mins with my boyfriend, and when he tried to open
   it, his hand started bleeding, but on what - we don't know.
   Eventually, I tried the door again, and nearly fell over as it was as
   easy as a feather. At the time, only the two of us lived in the house.
   Also, things would go missing, and turn up a few weeks later in the
   most strange and weird, even dangerous places. I suppose it makes life
   a bit more unpredictable eh?

<h>Stefan Banwell from Mid Glamorgan
<p>We always go over Penallta pit and we always get freaked out by the
   noises up there. I have seen a ghost once in the lockers window I
   swear.

<h>Sally from Aberdare
<p>Delete the story from Sally - we've published it in Weird Nation.

<h>Sally from Aberdare
<p>The Conway Inn in Aberdare is haunted. My uncle owns the pub and he
   told me a woman had hung herself upstairs in the past. He recently
   went on holiday leaving me 2 look after the place for a month. One
   night I heard a loud bang coming from the bar and thought I had been
   broken into but the alarm didn't go off so I thought nothing of it.
   The next morning I made it to the bar before the cleaner and the chair
   nearest the main door had been knocked back onto the floor and there
   were bottles behind the bar that had been hit over. It doesn't bother
   me but it seems too much of a coincidence. I've been told by people
   that they can feel something at the top of the stairs by the women's
   toilets. I would love to find out if there is someone there, or if
   someone has experienced something.

<h>ellz from pontypool
<p>I went to the catholic school St Albans in Pontypool. The school was
   home to the Handbury family, and was also during its stead a nunnery.
   There's a very famous photo of the original grand staircase. The photo
   is taken in the 80s of some of the pupils standing at the top of the
   staircase. Just behinde the pupils is an eerie white figure. Whether
   or not this was a ghost or a pupil trying to scare his classmates
   (which from the translucent appearance and the era it was taken where
   computer editing would have been a tricky task it semed a unlikely.
   The picture links with one of the stories of a phantom presumed to a
   nun. The tale goes she was walking alone at night down the grand
   staircase lost her footing and fell breaking her neck in the
   bannisters on the way to her death. I'd love to know if anyone who has
   attended or is in St Albans has had any experiences in the main A
   block building? Or if anyone knows anymore more about the dungeons off
   the stairs in B block, or more tales from the schools past?

<h>Samantha of Penygraig (Rhondda)
<p>My house is scary. I always get the feeling I'm being watched when I
   enter my brothers bedroom, and now and again my bedroom window opens
   on its own in the middle of the night. found out my grandad died in
   the house (I never knew him but I feel like I do when I see pictures
   of him).

<h>Carolyn Holt from Caldicot
<p>I organised a Fright Night at St. Briavels Castle last year to raise
   funds for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust. The South Wales Paranormal
   Research team were with us and there was definitely paranormal
   activity there on the night. We are organising another night in
   November - if anyone is interested check out the Cystic Fibrosis Trust
   Website.

<h>Chris davies from cardiff
<p>We went to Margam House or also known as Margam Castle and there is a
   staircase. On the staircase there have been numerous occasions where
   people have seen a man standing by the right pillar and we saw him!

<h>Jade Jones Rhydyfelin, pontypridd
<p>my house!!! deffo!! I HATE IT! IT'S REALLY SCARY!

<h>Jodey from Cwmbran
<p>St Michaels Church and Graveyard in Cwmbran is definitely haunted.
   John Fielding (Williams) is buried there (local Zulu war celebrity
   awarded the Victoria Cross). About a year ago, I saw a dark figure
   hovering around the John Fieldings gravestone.

<h>Jessica Squire from Ebbw Vale
<p>I visited the Skirrid Inn in Abergavenny. During the night my
   television kept cutting out. I could see several orbs floating around
   the wardrobe area, and the downstairs bar kept losing power. That is
   one place I'm terrified of going to ever again!

<h>Carl from Pontypridd
<p>I work with a group called Ghost Research Wales and I have been on
   many investigations in the south Wales area. If you find that you may
   have a ghost or are interested in going on an investigation please
   contact us www.ghostresearchwales.co.uk - no jokes please.

<h>Sasha, Ely, Cardiff
<p>Glan Ely High School, now known as Michaelston Community College, has
   a swamp at the back of the school. Going back a few years ago when I
   used to attend the school, I was on my way back to my lesson I looked
   back and seen a man hanging in the trees of the swamp. I know this
   wasn't my imagination as my friend described exactly the same thing as
   I seen and we were both shook up by it.

<h>Oggy, Rhymney valley
<p>Strange I should read about the figure on the Glyneath to Hirwaun
   Road. Not so long back I was sat in the passenger seat of my friend's
   car and thought he was going to hit this hooded figure which suddenly
   appeared to my left, near one of the laybys. I shouted "careful - you
   nearly hit that jogger"...when we both looked back the road was empty,
   yet we both saw him! Also, when working on Buckland ward in the old
   Merthyr General Hospital - lots of nurses swore they saw a crinoline
   lady that usually preceded a death or some other disaster on the ward.

<h>zoe , jordz , may and tash from trevethin
<p>Hey Lisa its us the ghost girls from Trevethin we talk to you all the
   time about the nun and we have had contact, I Zoe have said something
   already but trying to find out if there really is something in our
   school we'll tell you if we find info and stuff.

<h>Zoe, Trevethin, Pontypool
<p>I go to Trevethin Comp and have had ghostly things happen to me and my
   mates. I've been interested in ghosts for ages and want to find what
   is in the art room. We have had contact with the nun and a man who was
   said to be the old headmaster.

<h>Lisa, Pontypool
<p>Does anyone know of ghostly goings on at Trevethin Community School
   formerly known as County Grammar School for girls?? Cleaners have
   heard and seen weird goings on and one cleaner saw a nun in the art
   room.

<h>kushbaa begum from maindee, newport
<p>once i went to the irish pub and me and my family were sitting there
   the whole time having a socialising drink. when a group of us friends
   were talking about the the balti night in risca was suppose to be abit
   haunted where a ghost jumps from the balti bight to the next building.
   so we went to investigate at 3am. we went there and to our total
   horror we seen a blurry black image jump from the window, the gate
   went bang! and the black image disappeared. this was a total shock for
   me.

<h>Jossi Beattie from Abercalais
<p>Abercamlais is this massive old mansion my granny lives in. I go there
   every holiday. One time my cousin & I were in our my bedroom at night
   time when the door opened with this eerie scream. When I closed it I
   turned to look at the armchair and then wished I hadn't for I saw this
   old man sitting in the armchair looking at me. I ducked under the
   covers petrified. My cousin said that she saw 2 men walking towards us
   when I was asleep. I also saw people at desks working and faces in the
   fireplace. How freaky!

<h>Sarah from Cwmcarn
<p>My house is haunted. My mother died in this house. It was originally
   my nan & bamps. My 13 month old daughter would enter the house after
   my mum had died & be fine but to leave the house via the front hallway
   she would go hysterical & say there was a man on the stairs. Nobody in
   my family would go through the hallway after that. When my nan died, I
   bought the house & my kids would talk to the man upstairs. This went
   on until my now ex-husband left. We all think it was my bamp looking
   after us.

<h>Jon from Aberdare
<p>Cyfarthfa is not a scary place in my opinion but there is definately
   something there. I sat in the coffee shop with my girlfriend on a nice
   sunny summers day when out of the blue the hairs on my arm stood up
   straight, as if I were cold. I have never experienced anything like
   that before of since. Not a believer at all and have always challenged
   people to take me to experience the supernatural. My experience could
   have been associated with some rational medical explination. I didn't
   feel uneasy in the slightest.

<h>Tamsin Postlethwaite from Bristol
<p>We wnt to St Fagans and we went to this little room, and I remember
   seeing this little girl there with a teddy. She looked Victorian or
   something. I was on my own though cuz everyone was saying it was
   haunted so my cousin wouldn't go in. She doesn't believe me though!

<h>Mimi Dicks from Middlesex
<p>My mate in Middlesex told me that women wander the streets. I
   personally haven't seen anybody but sounds creepy! Mimi xx

<h>Amanda Scarfe from Caerphilly
<p>I have experienced loads in craig y nos, and st fagans, get wierd
   feelings when driving towards brecon from cardiff. I did some psychic
   drawing in margam castle, and have been taken over by a male figure
   when driving down th A449 in monmouth. Every where i go i get feelings
   or voices, even at home!!!

<h>Kt, Kilmarnock, Scotland (born in wales)
<p>i used to go 2 brynmawr comprehensive school. i heard rumars that the
   3rd floor is haunted by a girl who either commited suiside or was
   pushed out of the window as she plunged 2 her death she had left a
   white rose on the window sil. some was quite scared of going up 2 the
   3rd floor after school was over. ive been told that the welsh teacher
   has seen her ghost does anyone know anything about this story

<h>Chantelle Brooks from Nelson
<p>I think Llanbabon Road up in Nelson is a spooky street! It's full of
   old houses and pubs. It has a really old pub called the Greyhound and
   it's quite spooky! Also there's 2 graveyards which at night are
   spooky. My friend said that she saw a misty figure sitting by a tree
   and the next minute it was gone! They should send reporters or
   something. Another place is the fields. You can see ghosts of dead
   horses and old people on them. Really scary at night! Chantelle xx

<h>fluke nelson
<p>the stories about llancaiach fawr are a load of nonsense!!!, an old
   schoolmate of mine LIVED there, and he never mentioned any ghosts when
   we were kids.

<h>Juliet Porthcawl
<p>The A48 just after the round about where you can turn of to
   tythegston. have hear da few rumors about ppl seeing men run out of
   the dual carriageway into cars. anyone else heard anything

<h>Nicola John from Neath
<p>I used to work in a pub called the Bryncoch Inn & the landlord told me
   there was a ghost there. One night I was standing in the gap between
   the lounge and the bar, facing the lounge (the bar was closed & in
   darkness as it was being renovated). I suddenly had the feeling that
   someone was standing behind me. I nearly cricked my neck as I spun
   round to look into the dark bar but there was nobody there. My
   colleague asked me why I just did that so I told her & she said the
   exact same thing had happened to her moments before.

<h>Bethann Gunter, Blackwood
<p>We visited the Skirrid Inn in Abergavenny, the oldest inn in wales. We
   stayed overnight and strange things happened. My friend experienced
   her TV in her room switching on and off and also saw flashing orbs.
   Our other friend's phone was drained of power and we saw several orbs
   in one of the rooms. There was continuous power cuts throughout the
   night downstairs in the bar, but we had a fantastic time.

<h>A470.
<p>The man dressed in a black hat and a black coat in the A470 iz called
   The Black Wanderer... rumour has it that the man ran into the road
   years ago and tried to kill himself.. i dunno how far tru its is...

<h>khobbissor baaf from newport
<p>i heard the newport hotel is haunted as i know people who stay there
   have been spooked out. when i went to see some of the rooms there it
   looked like some one was watching you the whole time.

<h>Dan and Jay, Merthyr Tydfil.
<p>We used to go to Cyfarthfa High School in the castle back in the late
   90's...the round library is most definatley haunted!We saw ghostly
   figures up there on several occasions...

<h>Rhiannon.S.D. from Llandybie, Ammonford, Carmart
<p>i go to tre-gib school and i got realy spooked out when i found out
   that the school is built on the site of an old monnertsry. a monk
   still roams the corradors, i haven't seen it but loads of people have.

<h>laksuma begum
<p>Maindee primary school, cheptow road.. People say that a mrs polly
   died there after she failed an interview to become a teacher. It has
   been said that she became so depressed through her training she hung
   herself and mrs roberrette took her place. I was only 5 when i went to
   old maindee, but i remember all the junior children never went to the
   school toilets because the rope had still been up there. and a girl
   died in the toilet. The piano used to play by itself, she was supposed
   to have been a music teacher. I did not witness anything but did
   anyone go to that school between 1960-1990? Know anything?

<h>yanna from east ham
<p>i was at home by myself when i went in the kitchen to get some food.
   the light turned on by itself. i carried on as normal and when i went
   into the living room the hallway light turned on by itself. i switched
   it off and another kitchen light turned on. i also turned that off but
   then one of the living room lights turned on by itself. i got freaked
   out and phoned a relation, it turned out that it was the anniversary
   of my cousins death.

<h>hardik
<p>i had a school friend who alwaz scared me of evil spirits , donno why
   but i jus started believing him when i recently saw him , 8 years

<h>clayton mclaughlin
<p>I was in a room with sleeping and the darkness in the coner was making
   a pig noise and was creeping me out so I went up to it to see what it
   was and it was nothing soo I tryed sleeping after in the night and
   felt I was being watch by a porcilin pig man with dark eyesm and I
   squinted my eyes open and seen his legs standing 48 inches away form
   me so I pushed my hand out to push him away but I felt nothing and
   opened my eyse and there was nothing there

<h>Cara Williams from Caldicot
<p>I haven't been inside Caldicot Castle for years now (although I go to
   the castle atleast once a week) so I don't remember much... but I've
   heard the many stories of a ghost of a young boy in the reception, the
   ghost of the grey lady, the soldier ghost marching the castle grounds
   in the night, and the ghost of the monk in the castle keep. And a
   programme on S4C planedplant called Ofn, went to Caldicot castle and
   stayed there through the night. I'd love to try that some day!

<h>Robyn from merthyr
<p>I think that Llancaich fwar is definitely scary because I went there
   before for a ghost tour and I saw a ghost staring through a gap in the
   wall at me, and he followed me everywhere I went, even when I went to
   the toilet he still followed me. he even followed me home. well if you
   thought that was spooky when he followed me home, I was going in the
   bath, I saw a man bleeding in my bath, now that's spooky.

<h>chantelle
<p>me and my friend beth were visiting brecon, we were looking around st
   marys cathedral when we heard a noise from behind this door. we
   decided that we would go and have a look but as we opened the door
   there was lots of mist. we then heard something from upstairs so we
   carried on. we then went into this little room where we saw a little
   girl sitting on the floor with her head in her hands and she was
   crying. it wasn't until we went up to her to talk to her that we
   realised she was a ghost. although we were very scared we stayed there
   and she spoke to us! this was the greatest experience of our life and
   we will never forget it. we are making arrangements to go back to see
   if we can see this girl again!

<h>Im In Newport
<p>I was wondering if anyone knew about any ghostly going ons at The
   Dolls House in Abertillery, freinds of myn recently played a gig there
   and the amount of orbs picked up on the camera was amazing.

<h>Jerry...Maesteg
<p>We walk our dog in the local cemetry early in the mornings (6.30am).
   When we approach the grave diggers tool shed at the top of the cemetry
   the dog always stops.growls and barks at it.

<h>Aimee from Pontypool
<p>i went to west mon school and i know that a boy drowned in the
   swimming pool that we had there. now its a music suite. i slept there
   once, i can tell you it was very cold and i didn't get much sleep

<h>Julie from Aberdare
<p>I was coming up the Glynneath bank towards Hirwaun one evening and
   looked out of the driver side window becouse something caught my eye.
   I saw an old fashioned runner (jogger) wearing a long sleeved top
   running beside my car. He was completely grey and I looked again but
   he had gone but I definetly saw him.

<h>Tigger Fan From Torfaen
<p>Last month, I witnesed a boy being hit by a van at a main road near my
   home, and every time i walk past that spot, i see a small boy around
   ten years of age staring straight through me!

<h>Anne Rides from Cardiff
<p>Many years ago, I lived in Ball Rd Cardiff, opposite Llanrumney Hall.
   When my daughter was young she slept in my bedroom in her own bed at
   the foot of my bed while her own room was being decorated. One night I
   lay awake as I couldn't sleep. All of a sudden there appeared this
   tall ghostly figure that came through the window, dressed in a
   red-hooded long cloak. He paused, turned, looked down over my
   daughter, then passed through her, into the wall. My daughter says he
   is her 'guardian angel'. No, it didn't freak me out!

<h>Sarah Milligan, Porthcawl
<p>I live near the aptly named sker house - it is definitely scary - i
   mean very scary - i've never actually seen anything but it's the
   atmosphere!

<h>ELLIE from Doncaster
<p>I see a figure in the window of an old derelict house across from mine
   every night. i always say hello because i can feel the presence of the
   old woman. i'm not scared.

<h>Wild Woman from Cwmbran
<p>Around my area there has been a lot of talk about the fields near the
   police college, and the well in one of the sidings. My house is
   practically in the fields. I have been to the well many times as a
   child and with my children, but, personally, I have not seen anything
   there. Strangely enough though, I have once seen, in one of the
   smaller fields, an old Victorian village re-enactment - or so i
   thought. I was enjoying watching it from outside that field but i
   wanted to join in. As soon as i stepped into that field, everyone
   stopped and stared at me! Suddenly, everything just disappeared! Was
   it just a figment of my imagination? Or was there really a town of
   supernatural spirits right in front of me? YOU decide!

<h>juls from gwent.
<p>hi all im a media student,for a project i have to do a small horror,
   spooky trailer film lasting 3-5 mins, i am looking for a spooky house
   to film, if anyone has such a place and could offer this poor mature
   student a chance to prove her talents please contact me
   spinelliblonde@aol.com thnx

<h>Bill from Hengoed
<p>Penallta colliery - I've been there many times to take photo's of the
   beautiful old engine hall, however on one trip I was taking some shots
   of the pit wheels silhouetted against the sky when I saw a boy in a
   white shirt waving from the top of one of them. I waved back and took
   a photo, and carried on snapping away. Around twenty minutes later the
   lad had still not came down so I shouted up to him. As I did this I
   realised that the steps to the pit wheel had been removed and the legs
   were wrapped in barbed wire for the very purpose of stopping people
   from climbing up - assuming that however he had got up there, the boy
   must have thought I was going to shout at him for trespassing and was
   staying still to avoid me. After a while I was quite concerned, but
   being unable to climb up myself I asked some other boys who had turned
   up if they were missing a friend - No was the reply, and despite my
   warnings one boy proceeded to climb up the opposite pit wheel, which
   still had some steps attatched - from his view at the top he reported
   that the other pit wheel was empty. We checked the surrounding bushes
   in fear that the boy had fallen, but found nothing. At this point,
   feeling pretty foolish but insisting the boy had been there, I
   commented to the lads about losing my marbles and left. I was quite
   bemused by the event and put it down to the lads playing a trick on
   me, so you can imagine my bewilderment when the developed photographs
   showed not only the white shirted boy at the top of the pit wheel, but
   also at the foot of the same pitwheel, standing in the doorway of the
   engine hall, and in several shots of the interior of the engine room!
   My eyesight is perfect, and I still stand my ground that that boy was
   not there when I took the photos.

<h>Demi and Josh from Newport
<p>We were walking my dog around Tredegar House when our dog started
   barking and kept on staring at the pond. We turned to look and we saw
   a strange figure of a man staring at the pond. We thought it was a man
   taking a walk, when suddenly it disappeared.

<h>John from Newport
<p>I worked at Cefn Mably Hospital when it was closed from 1984 -1986.
   What a creepy place! Anyone got any stories to share?

<h>Geoff Fiddler from Barry
<p>I am lucky enough to be the landlord of the Skirrid Inn and the
   paranormal activity is incredible. Guests always have stories to tell
   when they stay in the old courtroom where sentence was carried out on
   many poor souls.

<h>keri from barry
<p>re; ghost at Royal Public House in Barry I have worked and stayed in
   this pub and can assure you that there definitely is a resident ghost!
   many customers have seen her.

<h>Craig Merthyr
<p>Crawsheys grave in Merthyr was extremly peacefull and not much to
   report there walk right round church but felt at ease. Walked down

   being watched by what or who i dont know.

<h>Andrea, Aberdare
<p>my house in maescynon, Hirwaun is haunted, about fourty years ago a
   man died in our bathroom. For the last 5 years a lot of spooky things
   have been happening. About two days before christmas i woke up in the
   early hours and there was a man standing by my bedroom door, he was
   there for about 15 minutes, it was very scary. Things go missing, very
   annoying! Recently i was upstairs and i heard someone coming up the
   stairs and in to the bedroom, thinking it was my dad in his white
   overalls i asked him what he was doin as i was sayin it a white figure
   walked past my door, i thought it was my father so i went to look but
   he had gone out there was no one in the house. Every night at the same
   time as im dropping off to sleep a creaking wakes me up in the same
   spot by my door, it freaks me out big time!

<h>shelz (margam)
<p>i heard that the hill behind my house is haunted cos i was told that
   on a time of a year the devil comes out and haunts the hill lk

<h>alan from aberdare
<p>it is true the tunnel that is referred to in this column was shut down
   after a young woman was stuck and killed by a train in the middle of
   tunnel

<h>Laura Williams from Wales
<p>There's a mountain right behind my house and up there is a cave which
   is now closed up by rocks. Rumour has it, hundreds of years ago three
   sisters went up that mountain and into the cave, and the cave
   collapsed on them. People say when they're walking up there they can
   hear cries from inside the cave! Spooky eh?

<h>Paul now in London
<p>It is indeed true about the boy hanging himself in the bell tower of
   West Mon School. It was sometime in the early 1960s, I believe, when
   the school was a boarding and grammar school. There were suspicious
   sounds heard in the West Wing througout the years I was studying at
   the school - 1973 to 1979.

<h>Wacko from Newport
<p>I have just started up a group to research paranormal occurances. If
   anyone knows of anywhere we can investigate or needs somewhere
   investigating please feel free to contact us. wackorocker@yahoo.co.uk

<h>Cheyenne of London
<p>I believe Carfarthfa Castle is haunted and I have written a story
   about it - you can read it on my website
   www.barbaraosullivanauthor.com I hope they make a film of it. Diamond

<h>stacy cardiff ely
<p>glan ely high school now known as michaelston has a ghost by the
   changing rooms at the end of the long corridoor in the girls changing
   rooms. Me and my friend unlocked the changing room door and a little
   boy ran into the showers i ran after him but he had vanished he could
   not have got out because my friend was standing by the door still in
   shock.

<h>Shelly from Port Talbot
<p>I heard that the maid of Sker died of a broken heart. She runs along
   the sand dunes at a certain time of the year with the white lady.
   Scary! It kept me up all night and I always talk about Sker House to
   my mates.

<h>Sam Ystrad Mynach (near Caerphilly)
<p>I have been to Llancaiach Fawr many times with family and school
   trips. I also went on a ghost tour halloween night about three years
   ago with my family and my partner. I have always hated the small room
   with the single bed and cot in (the birthing room), as I have always
   felt something there when visiting during the day. As myself and our
   group of visitors walked in I noticed how cold it was in there. The
   guide started explaining how the room used to be used when someone or
   something pulled on my jacket. I just looked at the stranger next to
   me and thought what are you doing, and then th=urned and carried on
   listening to the guide. Through all the time he was talking I had this
   tugging on my jacket. It was only after the tour that I mentioned this
   to the guide and he just laughed and said 'yeah a lot of people have
   had that - its just the children playing'. Freaked me right out and I
   think I scared that innocent stranger next to me with me staring at
   him thinking it was him tugging my jacket - oooops!

<h>Darryl born in Merthyr
<p>I was a pupil of Cyfarthfa Castle school and it is one freaky place,
   as is the old disused railway tunnel between Merthyr and Aberdare.

<h>Daniel
<p>Just reading about haunted places in merthyr, 1 said about sightings
   on the A470. A few times coming from mountain ash going back to
   merthyr just past the bridge by the abercynon roundabout i'm positive
   i've seen figures. As for cyfarthfa castle thats proper freaky. But
   for a real fright go down to Crawshays grave up by ponsticill.
   Aparently he was buried upside down beacause he was so evil they didnt
   want his soul escaping!!

<h>Amy, Cardiff
<p>There is a derilict house in Llandaff in Cardiff and my one friend
   went to walk her dog and thought she'd take a look inside the house as
   she walked in she looked in the mirror and saw a small ghost like
   person and felt chilly all of a sudden. She visited the house again
   with her cousin and the mirror had gone. Freaky? Or Had It Just Been
   Moved? Im Not Sure but she was really scared.

<h>MJ from Newport
<p>Me and my friends were in the field of our old school and we think we
   saw something that looked like a man and his dog! We were really
   scared but we stayed on the field. After 5 min we went to look then
   one of my friends fell down we thought he was joking but he was out
   cold. We have been trying find out more but we can't find anything to
   trace what we've seen. If anyone knows anything I will be checking on
   this site regularly.

<h>Jay from Merthyr
<p>Well, this was really weird. It happened a while ago. Anyway, it was
   really late at night & I was just watching T.V. with my cat Rau'le on
   my arm rest when all of a sudden my cat tilted all the way up staring
   at the ceiling. I only thought weird. I got curious and looked up, and
   in light colors were the letters H I ! I was so freaked out ! I still
   swear my cat was communicating with me !

<h>Mark from Penarth
<p>I have heard stories about the fields adjacent to Cogan hall
   farm.(with reference to Sopie from Penarths experience)There is an
   incredibly old church and graveyard on the site which might be worth
   researching. I heard a story about a ghost that was watching the local
   children as they camped out down the dell. he had red eyes and as they
   tried to take chase as he fled, the fastest of the group could not
   keep up as the spectre flew over a hedgerow and vanished into the
   direction of the farm/church/graveyard.

<h>Beppie from Porthcawl!
<p>Yeh Sker House is haunted cos my best mate from school, her mum used
   to live there as it was a family home passed down through the Morgan
   family. Her father died there from a chest infection and if you go
   through the house in a certain room you can hear the sound of a man
   struggling for his breath. Also the Maid of Sker is the daughter of
   one of the Morgans from many generations ago. He locked her in a room
   at the top of the house and ever since she has been seen wandering the
   dunes and seen around the house as if she's happy to be finally freed.

<h>Amanda from Bridgend
<p>Southerndown beach is a scary place to be at night and with its
   notorious history of pirates I am not surprised. I saw a dark shadowy
   figure many years ago in the car park - it walked past the car i was
   in. And when I asked my friends who it was they all said no one. My
   mate turned the car around to where this person would have been
   standing. There was no one there, just a big drop to the beach.

<h>Ghandi Opnhan from Vietnam
<p>I emigrated to Australia when I was 23 years old. One Christmas I came
   back home to Wales to visit my grandmother in her 'new house' that she
   had just moved into. When she told me that she moved into a new house
   i thought it was great, but when I actually got to her house, I found
   out that she was living in a converted school, in the middle of the
   Welsh countryside. It looked kinda freaky from the outside, but from
   the inside, it was a warm home ... or so I thought! On the first
   night, I slept in the very top room of the house, the attic. I was
   just drifting off to sleep when I heard the sound of children playing.
   I opened my eyes and there were 4 little girls at the bottom of my bed
   dancing around in a circle and singing. I totaly freaked because they
   werent from our era, they looked Victorian! Freaky, as my nan lives in
   a converted Victorian school!!

<h>Mark from Swansea
<p>I am very interested in Sker House, and personally think that it is
   haunted! I mean just look at it... I understand that many people claim
   to have seen the "Maid of Sker", and other ghosts. Is this absolutely
   genuine, or are you making it up? Are there any people out there who
   have 100% seen a ghost at or near Sker house in Kenfig? Also
   Aberglasney near Llandeilo? I would be very interested to read your
   stories. No jokers please!!!!

<h>Moe from the US
<p>I believe everyone of you! Good thing I don't live where you guys
   live... I would freak out!! Here's freaky story that happened to me
   about two or three months ago! One time I was listening to Slipknot (a
   heavy metal band I like) in my DVD player, and this song I didn't like
   at the time came on (track number 8) and my DVD player turned it to
   track number 12 (I think it turned to 12 I had it on shuffle), I
   didn't touch my remote or do anything I was just standing there
   looking puzzled trying to figure out who changed it! I am still trying
   to figure that out, too!!

<h>Diana from Ohio.
<p>I've been to Wales many times we go there on trips but we visited
   Llanciach Fawr Manor and we were on the bottom floor and I was looking
   in a mirror and my husband James went outside just to look around and
   while I was looking at the mirror I saw like a shadowy figure standing
   and then I shut my eyes cause I had something in one of my eyes. And
   then when I opened them up I looked at the mirror again and a person
   was standing there. He just looked like a normal humen. And then I
   turned around and no one was there.

<h>Mark from Swansea
<p>Hello again, my favourite places around here are Aberglassney,
   Craig-y-Nos, Sker house, Plas Teg, Margam park. These places I believe
   to be genuinley haunted although there are so many other locations in
   Wales its unbelievable. Has anybody actually genuinley seen a ghost in
   any of these locations?

<h>Jo from Merthyr Tydfil
<p>Cyfarhfa Castle is definatley haunted! When I went to school there
   some 16 or 17 years ago in a rainy lunch hour in a classroom which was
   allegedly Crawshay's bdroom (how true that is I am not sure) we
   pretended to conduct a seance (obvioulsy not doing it properly as only
   11 at the time and had no experience in these matters!) and we
   stupidly asked for something to happen that would cause us to have
   time off school but not to harm anyone or anything. As we requested
   this the window slammed shut and the board rubber fell on the floor.
   The very next day the school was closed as a storm had caused some
   tress to fall on the driveway leading up to the castle. More than a
   coincidence I would say!!

<h>Shopping Fan
<p>At MacArthur Glen shopping village in Bridgend I saw this girl running
   around. She ran from near the entrance by the Odeon and then down past
   a Jewelers shop, past a shop that sells papers and another that sells
   towels. It ran across to the shoe shop the other side and then
   straight through the glass doors the restaurant area and over the to
   the play area before vanishing. When I say she ran through the glass
   doors... she went THROUGH them without opening. It was quite weird but
   not spooky! Keep an eye open next time you are there and go in and
   question the staff, I bet they must have seen it loads of times!

<h>Sophie Tucker from Newport
<p>On my 2nd wedding anniversary, my husband and i decided to go out on a
   drive in the countryside. We ended up stopping for a drink at a pub
   which we had never come across before. When we entered the pub the
   people were all dressed in clothes which i think were from the 18th
   century but we didnt think anything of it as we married on the 31st of
   October, and it was Halloween. We had our drink and then left. The
   next day we decided to find the Pub to have lunch in. We drove all
   over the countryside.....and we still havent found the pub to this
   very day!

<h>Claire T and Rhiannon W from Cwmbran
<p>We visited Llanciach Fawr Manor on a school trip when we were in
   Primary School. It does have an eerie atmosphere, but we didnt
   experience any Parenormal activities! Claire is obsessed with the
   program 'Most haunted' and she is Craving to watch the visual that
   they did at Llanciach fawr!! We really want to come to Llanciach Fawr
   manor for one of the ghost hunt nights, but we are only 14 years old
   and you have to be 16 to go!!! Gutted!!

<h>Geraint from Merthyr Tydfil
<p>I am in Cyfarthfa school and I used to help out in the libary. One
   lunch time me and one other libarian were clearing up when one of the
   chairs moved and they are big heavy chairs. So we stopped and just
   looked at each other. We carried on and it happened again. It got
   worse when I put the key in the door and it wouldn't open. When we
   finaly got out we were scared to say the least. After that, the heater
   would turn on on it's own on a regular basis.

<h>Amy from Tredegar
<p>Tredegar house is haunted, and the park surrounding it, so many weird
   encounters happen there - dont come to tredegar park or house at
   night!! It's spooky and will give you the creeps!!! I have once seen a
   strange shape in the window of Tredegar house, I looked back and it
   was gone. Another encounter I have had was about 2 years ago, an old
   pub which burned down a few years ago, we were looking in the space
   where a pane of glass should be, but instead it was black. My friend
   looked in and called my other friend Chloe. I looked up and called my
   friend Ashley, but when he looked up he thought that we were being
   stupid cause there was nothing there. . .

<h>Carla from Pontypool
<p>The other day in Westmon School I was looking for my friends who had
   been in another lesson, and I came across an empty corridor. I was
   walking along it and I could have sworn there was someone (or
   something) walking behind me, but it was completely empty.

<h>Christine Wats from Pontypridd
<p>In Wales their are so many ghosts it's unbelievable. I have seen one
   before in my school, St.Albans. My advice to people who get scared
   easily is don't go to Wales.

<h>Natelie Briggs from Pontypool
<p>Once when I was in Westmon School I wanted to know what was up the top
   of the stairs above the English rooms. So me and my friend went up
   there and there was an old room we thought we heard someone trowing
   something like a chair but when we went in no - one was there!

<h>Mark from Swansea
<p>I am a believer but also insist that you must be sceptical, and to
   outrule basic things first before jumping to conclusions.I'm very
   suprised that there has not been much interest in Aberglassney(a very
   strange place!) and also Craig Y Nos castle where I have encountered
   my own experiences. I am still waiting to see a ghost though! Sker
   house is haunted, just look at it!!! Has anybody genuinley seen a
   ghost at margam park?

<h>Cloie Walshe from Newport
<p>Tredegar House is really scary because I saw a ghost in there.

<h>Sian, Cardiff
<p>I visited Llancaich Fawr on a late night ghost walk. It was really
   freaky but there's no malice in that house at all, except for one room
   which just feels terribly sad. I had a pain in my leg and the guide
   then told me that lots of people get leg pains in there and apparently
   there was a man with a wooden leg who lived there. My friend and I
   felt really cold blasts of air on our hands and I felt them across my
   face. We also heard a cry when we were in the childs room. I aslo
   managed to freak the guide out when we were in the kitchen by saying
   that I felt pains in my chest and got the feeling of two women sitting
   next to the fire with blankets over them and making things. She told
   me that over Christmas, she had been sitting there, wrapped in
   blankets and she had a very bad asthma attack. I think that people who
   dismiss it as rubbish should think twice about condemming it!!

<h>Bally from Snaresbrook
<p>Once me and my step sister were lost in Snaresbrook Cemetry. After a
   few hours trying to find a way out of what looked like a massive
   forest, we gave up and sat on a stone. The stone broke and a skull
   rolled out. Freaky

<h>Abi from Cardiff
<p>The George Inn at St.Briavels is extremely scary. I stayed there after
   our car broke down right near it. I stayed in Room 4 and I was gettin
   ready in the bathroom and cleaning my teeth, when I heard a knock on
   my door so I went to open it and as I did I felt a breeze of cold air
   on the back of my neck! There was no-one there but I was sure I could
   see the outline of a person walking down the hall. I shut the door and
   felt the exact same rush of cold air but this time in my face. All
   through the night I could hear footsteps on the landing.

<p>I told the co owner and she said that that was the ghost of the old
   owner of the George Inn and she often still walked along the landing.
   I was also told that I was very lucky to have a glimpse of her because
   not many people have seen her. But the co owner was lucky enough to
   see her too and believed every thing I told her!

<p>If you're looking for a scary night I recommend there and even if you
   don't see the ghost it is great fun anyway!

<h>Tessa from Walsall
<p>I've been to Wales a fair few times but nothing spooky has ever
   happened there. But if anyone has ever been to Ingestre Hall, then
   they'll know of the Blue Staircase. Now the owners use Ingestre Hall
   for school trips and I went for a music trip. The Blue Staircase is
   often used for weddings and thats were the bride will walk down. One
   night after rehersals I was walking past and I saw a lady in a wedding
   dress at the top. I must have looked embarressed as she smiled. "I'm
   so sorry I didn't realise there was a wedding going on, I hope I
   haven't caused any inconvienience." The woman laughed and said not to
   worry as the wedding had been cancelled. I thought nothing more about
   it and went off to bed.

<p>Next morning at breakfast I asked my teacher if there had been a
   wedding here last night. He looked at me puzzled and said "What, don't
   be ridiculous why would they double book. It's all your imagination!"
   I decided to get a secongd opinion and went to the co-owner. He didn't
   seem at all surprised by what I told him and said that it was the
   bride that I had seen on the staircase. He told me that years and
   years ago, there was going to be a wedding but the bride had slept
   with the best man. Her fiance had found out and killed her on the
   stairs in her wedding dress. She only will appear to someone walking
   by themselves (that's why they had told us to go around in pairs or
   more) past the staircase. I was a bit freaked out by this but walked
   past again the next night and saw her again but this time waved smiled
   and went. The last night when we left I was going back into the house
   to get my flute and I walked past the staircase. Someone said goodbye
   to me and I just thought it was the owner or something, but when I
   turned, the bride was walking up the staircase, she waved at me so I
   waved back and then she disappeared.

<p>I did tell people about this but no one except the owner and co-owner
   believed me.

<h>George, Courtice Canada ex-Pontypridd
<p>When I worked at Borg Warner at Kenfig I was told about the ghost of a
   monk that haunted the factory (built on the site of the old abbey) but
   just dismissed it as a wind up of the new guy. Then when I was working
   the night shift and most of the lights were turned off I saw a dark
   shape moving around the machines. I tried to follow it but it seemed
   to melt through a wire cage and then the wall. I left in the other
   direction to get to the lights!

<h>Karlie from Abertillery!
<p>The old W wing in West Mon school in Pontypool is said to be haunted.
   So the story goes a young boy hung himself from the bell tower at the
   back of the English rooms. I never saw anything but the cuboard where
   he supposdly stayed always had a very cold and bad vibe! Karlie!

<h>Claire from Caerphilly
<p>Caerphilly Castle - it's not exactly scary but there is definately
   something there. In the ruins of the solar behind the Great Hall I can
   almost hear a woman singing - just the sound of a tune I can never
   remember and words I can't make out. One night we were driving past at
   about 10:30 and my friend asked if the Castle was still open because
   she'd seen a woman on top of one of the towers.

<h>Linda Griffiths
<p>If any body wants any proof that spirits do exist then watch out for
   "World's Scariest Ghosts" on Bravo. I have seen it a few times and it
   is dead freaky. It shows a little girl sitting at her table and the
   chair is moving but she is 100% not moving it herself cos her feet are
   resting on the bar. It is scary and the things they show, I believe it
   is 100% true.

<h>Tonna - Neath - South - Wales
<p>Id just like to say right from the start that I'm a very sceptical
   person, and can't quite rationally understand what happened in my
   previous house.

<p>Myself and my mother had lived in a house in Henfaes Rd in Tonna for
   17 years, and had never experienced anything remotely strange nor felt
   uncomfortable at all. But for a period of around 6 months some strange
   things occured that are quite hard to explain. When I was 16, myself
   and my girlfriend were in my bedroom watching tv and eating food, when
   a tube of my girlfriends lip balm, that was sitting on my desk on the
   oppostite side of the room, somehow just went through the air and
   landed in between us. We both saw the object come towards us and land
   on the bed. It completely freked us out and neither of us could
   understand what could have made it move. This was the first personal
   experience that I have had of anything unusual and I still find it
   hard to conceive how it could have done that.

<p>In the following months several similar incidents occured, especially
   an occasion one night where loud banging noises came from downstairs
   for a several minutes, (as if someone was trashing our living room),
   and nothing was out of place when we went down to see what was
   happening. The noise just suddenly stopped, and nothing at all was
   moved or misplaced, and all the doors were still locked. To this day I
   cant imagine what could have created such a realistic and frightening
   noise. It was as if something was literally downstairs. For a family
   of sceptical and rational thinkers, it became quite a strange and
   annoying experience, though gladly one day it just stopped.

<p>Its been quite a while now since all this happened, but it would be
   quite nice to hear from anyone else that experienced similar things.

<h>Onai from Leeds
<p>Mount St Mary's High School is haunted by a headless nun. Ask anyone
   who goes there. Even the Deputy Head, Mr Boothe, who's worked there
   for a really long time (and I'm not kidding I mean a REALLY long
   time!!) will tell you that he's seen it. And trust me he's not the
   type of guy that "jokes" around about stuff like this!!!!

<p>One time in year 7 I was in my music lesson, absolutely bored to
   death. Then suddenly the whole class heard a thud in the corridor. My
   teacher went out to check and found nothing. But two boys sat next to
   me said they saw a flash of black... the nun! And another time my
   music teacher stayed back late after school and she walked into the
   other room down the corridor and saw the nun watering the plants. She
   always comes back now and again to water our plants in the music room.
   But here's the thing... the plants are dead because she's dead.
   There's the part that freaks me out. All the time.

<h>Louise O'Grady
<p>Two years ago my dad and I were driving across the Severn Bridge
   coming back to Wales, Llanelli, when I looked up and saw a pair of
   legs dancing on the bonnet. I'm sure I saw it and my dad said he saw
   it too. We told my mum when we got back and she told me my older
   sister Jessica was run over by a car just outside her college, and her
   legs were taken off. It has taken me two years to tell anyone this as
   I was so traumatised by my sisters accident and my mum always told me
   to keep quiet about our strange experience. I'm over it now but
   wondered if anyone has ever experienced this. Thanx so much for any
   help you can give me, Louise O'Grady xxx

<h>Shan from Merthyr
<p>In the old hospital is a ghost but I have not seen anything there. But
   I have felt like someone was touching my face, and my friend said to
   me that about 4 men would not go in there becase they have all seen
   ghosts.

<h>Rachael. E. from Newport
<p>I'm agreeing with Emma Nicholson and Steph. The red farm house in
   Saint Fagans is so creepy... I love the museum and always used to go
   there when I was a kid but I always refused to go upstairs in that
   house.. Freaky!?

<h>Kim, used to be local
<p>Further to Rachael's comments about the Prince Of Wales Estate: In the
   mid-80's someone working in Thames Case saw one of the miners from the
   disaster... and was scared witless.

<h>Steph from Caerphilly
<p>To Emma Nicholson, Re: Red House St Fagans - You`re totally right, I
   haven't been to St Fagans since I was small, but my parents recently
   told me in a "reminiscing session". Fun, how I would never go in to
   the Red House when we visited and I'd cry if they tried to take me in.

<h>Rachel Walker from Cardiff
<p>Schools in Cardiff are haunted. Years ago a man hung himself - he
   haunts schools. My mum says she sees him smoking a cigar. Her friends
   say that too and they can smell his tobacco.

<h>Sophie from Cardiff
<p>I was in IKEA last week perusing the food hall bit when I came across
   a copy of Tony Adam's biography 'Addicted'left on a stack of dime
   bars. Held in place by an elastic band was a sheet of paper slightly
   smaller than the book cover which read 'I am not lost - see inside for
   instructions'. I glanced around me suspiciously (gawd knows what for
   exactly) and then headed off - bemused and slightly spooked by the
   whole thing. Has anyone else seen this?..and, yes, I have read and
   enjoyed Mr Adam's book.

<h>Topcat, Cardiff
<p>St Mary's Church, Ely. Smoke without fire. A graveyard that at first
   glance is well kept but on looking again is derelict and unkempt. A
   feeling of not being alone, and knowing that you have outstayed your
   welcome. Legends of Black Masses and suicidal priests don't really
   make for a sense of well being, which is a shame as St Mary's sits on
   an Iron Age hillfort that also has remnants of Norman occupation and
   is supposedly the convergance point of a number of Ley lines. Perhaps
   it's connected in some mystical way to other ancient sites such as
   Tinkinswood which isn't too far from Ely. For more strange stories
   surrounding the church check out the South Wales Echo and Western Mail
   archives. A lot have been recorded. Does anyone know if the fort has
   ever been excavated and if so where there any finds?

<h>Felicity Braund from Cardiff
<p>I must admit that Mark Gremlin Jones' story seems very far fetched!
   But I do have a story about that very cemetery. My friend lives near
   by, so I went round there for a drink (or two!) When I arrived at her
   house at around about half past 9 and went into the kitchen to get a
   bottle of wine, I looked out of the window and saw what looked like a
   woman dressed in white wandering around the graveyard. My friend lives
   on the new estate there, so we had a good view. This continued for
   about a minute, and then the figure just literally disappeared. I am
   not sure if I was seeing things, but my friend's pretty sure she's
   seen it a number of times! Have you?

<h>Jane Sumford from Porthcawl
<p>I live opposite the newly re-done Sker House and I thought I'd do a
   spot of bird watching. I looked the house up and down and through one
   of the windows I saw the Maid of Sker looking sad out of the window. I
   looked again and she was gone!

<h>Toni M. from Espoo, Finland
<p>I'm glad that I don't live in Wales! So many ghosts in so many places.
   I surely would feel uneasy. There aren't any ghosts here, I don't know
   why. It's really amazing. None of my friends have ever seen a ghost,
   apart from my mom who saw a ghost in her childhood home in
   Manamansalo. On the same island they say two sons murdered their
   father. My cousin has a cabin near that place and the forest looks so
   eerie, even if it was daytime. Also on the same island (Manamansalo is
   an island) there is an old cemetery which dates back from c.16th
   century. According to a legend, in the end of 19th century a man dug
   up some bones he found and fooled around with them. Subsequently a
   ghost of a big, tall man haunted him for the rest of his life. In
   Paltaniemi there was also a cemetery. Half of it collapsed to a lake
   centuries ago and the remains of people were floatingin the lake. The
   rest of the graves were dug up and the bodies relocated. Only holes
   remain in the old graveyard. In Kajaani an old mansion called
   Karolineburg is said to be haunted by a young lady. When a portrait of
   her was removed from the bedroom a few years ago, mysterious fires
   appeared out of nowhere. They stopped when the painting was hung back
   to its old place. People have also felt the presense of someone in the
   house. Today the Karolineburg is a hotel and you can actually stay in
   the room if you dare, that is.

<h>Mark Gremlin Jones from Kenfig Hill
<p>If you go to Pyle Church and sit in the grave yard, I've seen the main
   angel gravestone fly away.

<h>Ang from Cardiff
<p>I live in a 3 storey semi detatched house with my parents and
   daughter. Over the years we have had some strange things happen.
   Footsteps up/down stairs and hallways, plates flying off the drainer,
   someone playing on the pool table. My daughter has been badly
   scratched even though her fingernails are always short - she wants to
   move as it's freaking her out. Things going missing then turning up in
   the strangest places. I have been poked in the back and my friend has
   been knocked on the head. Cupboard doors opening. My dog will not
   sleep in the house as he cries and barks when in. According to the
   neighbours a man who lived here before committed suicide. I'm going to
   the records office to check previous owners of the house then check
   the names with the death register. Then I might be able to put a name
   to our non-rent paying guest.

<h>Spooked, South Wales
<p>I used to work at Llechwen Hall, Pontypridd, for a number of years.
   I'd always been told by various people that it had a ghost or two but
   didn't really believe it until I had an experience there myself. It
   was the end of my working shift. All rooms upstairs were empty since
   the all the residents were still in the function room. We were waiting
   for the room to empty when myself and my colleagues heard tremendously
   heavy footsteps coming from upstairs. They were so heavy that the
   door, which was locked, leading from the bar into the function room
   shook violently in its frame. My first thought was that someone had
   kicked the door, but this was not the case since there was nobody near
   the door at the time. My next thought was that someone was running
   around upstairs. I went to reception to check if anyone had gone
   upstairs. The owner and 4 other colleagues who were in the reception
   told me that there was nobody upstairs and that they had heard the
   footsteps too!!

<h>J Tammy
<p>While on a visit at the manor, on a ghost tour i and my family
   exprienced strange things, while in matty's bedroom i was standing at
   the foot of the bed and my sat dad down on the bed i was leaning
   against the bed, the guide was explaining the strange happenings, my
   hair was loose and i could feel someone parting my hair as if they
   were running their fingers through it, it was chilling and didn't want
   to say. and also my father was missing some buttons from his new shirt
   when we left.

<h>Linda Griffiths, Merthyr Tydfil
<p>The A470 on the the way to Merthyr is very scary. My husband has seen
   a figure on the side of the road and when he looked back they had
   disapeared. Now he wont drive past there because he cant explain where
   they would have gone so quickly and he thinks they are ghosts from the
   Aberfan disaster.

<h>Peter from Nelson, Mid Glam
<p>I am 68 years of age and as a child visited Llancaiach Fawr many
   times, as my uncle was a friend of the family - Mr & Mrs Williams.
   Never ever on any visit 60 years ago was there any mention of ghosts.
   I think it's a money making load of old rubbish. But it employs people
   I suppose.

<h>Eve Orchard from Cardiff
<p>On the main road between Newport and Risca, there used to be an old
   derelict house standing alone in fields (now a housing estate).
   Everytime I passed there I saw a girl at an upstairs window. She wore
   a white nightgown and had long black hair. Her arms were outstretched
   and she appeared to be in distress, pleading for help. I sensed that
   she was locked in that house and that her end would be unpleasant. My
   mind's eye told me the period was approx 16th century. I would love to
   research that old house, but don't know where to start. Also, I can
   relate to Tomas Cole from Nantyglo and his experience on the Milfraen
   mountain. I too have had the same experience at the same place.

<h>Melissa Shorten from Petersfield, Hampshire
<p>Born and bred in Cardiff I worked as a Saturday girl in Allders. To
   bring china up from the cellars to be sold we had to climb down about
   4 sets of solid stone stairs to the basement which was at one time the
   embalming chambers of St Johns Church (opposite the Market). I was
   always followed down those stairs by an angry little man, mumbling
   away to himself with a lantern on a stick. I hated going down there.

<h>Vicky and Carly from Ogmore Vale
<p>We went on a trip to visit Llancaiach Fawr about 2 yrs ago with our
   school. When we were talking outside the manor, a strange dark shadow
   passed the kitchen window, and when we walked around inside the
   building we had the feeling someone or something was following us. It
   was dead scary but exciting! If you want to see a ghost, I suggest you
   go there..

<h>Jo from Cardiff
<p>I used to work in the Odeon Cinemas in Cardiff, and the older of the
   two in Queen Street gave weird vibes. Not bad feelings but the feeling
   of not being alone, and the smell of lavender was quite strong around
   one particular seat in the upstairs screen.

<h>Tomas Cole from Nantyglo
<p>I was up the Milfraen mountain when from what I thought was a tree - a
   ghostly figure of a man with a hood and a long coat casually walked
   towards me. From that day the Milfraen has been very unsettling for me
   and my mates.

<h>Martine from Cardiff
<p>Many years ago, myself and a group of my school friends use to hang
   about in this old derelict house called "Quarry House". It was a
   massive old house,and it was really spooky. I always felt a breeze on
   the back of my neck, and my mate said she seen a figure of a man
   watching her. But it was like he was dressed in black. I never went
   back to the house after that - it is now a nursing home!

<h>Claire from Llantwit Major
<p>Someone should check out the old Swan Inn in Llantwit Major. There are
   a couple of ghosts, and underground tunnels connecting the pubs,
   church and great house......creepy.

<h>Barry John from Nantyglow
<p>I was at the park one day with my friends having a talk, and we then
   started talking about ghosts and I mensioned to one of my friends that
   I could make contact with the dead. They didn't belive me at first
   until I started talking about thier passed-on relatives. This was
   about 10 years ago now and I am 24 now and can't contact the dead any
   more, but I'll never forget the day down the park ten years ago.

<h>Rhodri from Porthcawl
<p>While living at 78 Cowbridge Road West, Ely, Cardiff my partner and i
   repeatedly experienced bad atmospheres cold spots and general bad
   feeling in the upstairs back room. Hairs on my neck are up now just
   thinking about it, brrr. Had a priest in to say prayers, worked for a
   while but still a terrible bad feeling there. Anyone know if
   anything's happened there?

<h>Sophie from Penarth
<p>I have had some very odd experiences in my brand new house on the
   Cogan Hall Farm development followed by a number of recurring dreams
   about a man who shoots himself...can anyone tell me if something
   happened here?

<h>Sam 'n' Zack from Bristol
<p>In the Rhymney house hotel, there is a ghost of a maid servant who
   killed herself when she found she was expecting a baby.

<h>Jason Hawkins from Aberdare
<p>I was travelling through Nelson 2 days ago - I remember the time
   distinctively 3.30am. And as I was driving past Llancaiach Fawr Manor
   on the road outside there was a man standing there in a black hat and
   long black cloak. As I slowed down he disappeared - it was really
   frightening.

<h>Sam Davies from Merthyr Tidfil
<p>My school Cyfarthfa Castle is haunted because me and my friends have
   heard ghosts

<h>BJ, Bridgend
<p>If you're looking for a night's sleep and a spooky encounter, then try
   the Wheather Lodge in Bridgend.... very active

<h>Lyn from Cardiff
<p>I am a member of a group investigating paranormal research around
   South Wales and we are based at Llancaiach Fawr. There have been
   numerous reports of paranormal activity there and we are actively
   monitoring these. If anyone has any other 'paranormal event' that they
   want investigating anywhere in South Wales, please visit the South
   Wales Paranormal Research site (www.geocities.com/southwalespr) and
   register your interest.

<h>Ann Marie Devonshire from Penpedairheol
<p>I visited Llancaiach Fawr last November I think, on a ghost tour, I am
   quite a sceptic and it usually takes a lot to convince me of spooky
   happenings; I'm convinced now though!! I was the last person in our
   group and was hanging back with my boyfriend to take a closer look at
   things, I felt fingers tickling my back quite playfully, I laughed and
   turned around expecting my boyfriend to be there. He wasn't - just
   blackness greeted me I turned around and saw that he was in front of
   me. This is not what I expected - a ghostly touch to feel like, they
   felt so real...

<h>Lynne from Pencoed
<p>Whilst living in a flat in Harlow, years ago, I always felt I was not
   alone. One night I woke up and felt there was someone (other than my
   husband) in the room. I was so frightened I screwed my eyes shut and
   hid under the covers. When I came out there was a man (not my
   husband!) sitting on the edge of the bed with an old fashioned ruffled
   shirt on and long hair. He turned to me and said "Don't be frightened,
   I'm not here to scare you" then stood up and walked out of the room.
   From then on I still felt a presence but did not see him again. This
   is the only time this has ever happened to me and was over 20 years
   ago! - I was not drunk or dreaming!

<h>Charlotte from Caerphilly
<p>My house is haunted by two ghosts, one a woman that glows green and
   the other my father. He plays music in my room and creates smells of
   burning wood, fireworks and many others. She stands in the doorway of
   my room and looks at me for around 15 minutes at a time. I sometimes
   think she's tryiny to tell me something, and I hope one day I'll find
   out since I'm partly psychic.

<h>Ceri from Ely
<p>My nan once told me years ago my uncle was out walking very early in
   the morning near St. Mary's church. He has never been afraid of this
   place as his sister was the last person to marry here - so he only had
   happy memories of how it once was.

<p>What he saw changed all that. He saw a monk come floating from behind
   the church, go to an old watering hole, stop, look down and then float
   back to behind the church. He ran home white as a sheet and has not
   been near the place since, and will not talk about his experience.

<h>Rev Christopher Trefor Davies from Maesteg
<p>Howells Store Cardiff where a baptist was burned to death for being a
   baptist. His last name was White and he was a seaman. I don't get
   frightened in the store, but I was once led to walk into the old
   church's pillars which are still there.

<h>Emma Salvatore from Porthcawl
<p>There is nothing better than a good ghost story - and my grandmother's
   house in Kenfig Hill has had its fair share of ghosts. The past owner
   haunts the house and has caused so much damage - smashed all of the
   windows of the house with one terrific BOOM!!!

<h>Steve Baines from Cardiff
<p>Unlike Mr Prosser from Lisvane, the only times I get a cold feeling in
   the pit of my tummy in Howells is when I see the price of what the
   wife is walking off to the tills with...or when I realise an older
   gentleman has deliberately followed me into the customer toilets!!
   Spooky or what?

<h>Alain Prosser Jones from Lisvane, Cardiff
<p>Perhaps I am silly, but I always get a strange cold feeling in the pit
   of my stomach when I am close to the remains of the old church
   incorporated into the structure of Howells department store in
   Cardiff. Was it not on this spot that someone was burned for heresy in
   the 16th century?

<h>Dafydd ap Tudor in Cowbridge
<p>I concede the Prince at Kenfig is spooky at times as can be the Angel
   Inn in Maudlam at times. However most ghost stories about Sker were
   made up by various inhabitants & assosiates to keep away the locals.
   This place was a smuggling ship wreckers den of theives despite the
   grandeur of its facade!

<h>Mark Forester from North Cornelly
<p>The Prince Of Wales at Ton Kenfig (about 2 miles from Sker). Like all
   good pubs it's reputed to be haunted. It's the former town hall of the
   former town of Kenfig (a large town almost totally destroyed in the
   16th century by violent storms!!!). As a sceptic even I have felt a
   strange presence in the place on a few occasions. However it could
   have been the other type of spirit that caused them!

<h>Kerry Morgan
<p>I agree with Chad Pearce there are loads of stories about Sker house &
   some may have foundation, especially given its history. However
   Jodie's tale seems a little far fetched. Who walks across miles of
   unlit sanddunes in the early hours?(unless they tresspased & took a
   short cut!) What did they hope to catch? Use worms not scotch as bait.

<h>Andrew Evans from Abertridwr
<p>In Groes Wen there is an abandoned farm house near the lane. Me and
   mates were messing about with a camcorder just below the grounds,
   trying to make a video. When we got home and watched it, there is an
   orb hovering above our heads. There were no street lights, and nothing
   else was there at the time! I didn't really believe in orbs being
   connected to spirits but this was bigger than anything you've ever
   seen on television.

<h>Chad Pearce from Porthcawl
<p>There are loads of stories about Sker House, but I've been lucky
   enough to see inside since its restoration & only got good vibes.

<h>Hannah Loudon from Belfast
<p>I visited Llanciach Fawr and it is freaky! I love it so much even
   though I always hear people calling my name from around the walls!!!

<h>Molly from Cardiff
<p>On our school trip to Llancaich Fawr we were having a tour of the
   house I felt a cold chill go through my body when we went past the
   great hall. While the tour guide was talking to us I turned around and
   I saw a ghost sitting in a chair!!! I told my freinds to come and see
   it, but when they looked it was gone! How freaky is that?

<h>Leon From Barry
<p>I have recently moved into Barry from Cardiff and my partner has
   recently give birth to our son. Ever since, we have experienced a lot
   of strange things happening in our home like cupboards opening, taps
   turning themselves on, and the most frightening - my daughter's TV
   moved on its stand. We are very upset and are seeking help.

<h>Rachael Brown from Newbridge
<p>Prince of Wales industrial estate in Cwmcarn - when they capped the
   old shafts to build FastParts. When they were working on the shafts
   the area felt so sad and eerie. nNt nice to work there at all.

<h>Steve from Barry
<p>Whilst working as a glass collector at the Cwm Ciddy pub, I cleared a
   table occupied by a sad looking woman. She promply got up from her
   chair and walked straight through the wall! What was even more spooky
   was that after a little research (and a stiff drink!) I found out that
   the exact spot she walked through the wall was where the old entrance
   used to be.

<h>Ladean Bartlett from Newport
<p>Whilst at the Skirrid Inn with my husband, a couple of friends and our
   dog, we were investigating the notches on the hanging beam. My dog was
   sniffing around the staircase. We went back near there around 20
   minutes later and my dog refused to go near the stairs. He was very
   agitated and was making whiny noises which he has never done before.

<h>Tom Magic from Bristol
<p>Castle Coch was well strange. First bad vibes from the court yard and
   then from the forest on the hill. I thought I saw two dogs but they
   disappeared when I went behind a tree. Also my friend saw a UFO flying
   over the motorway when he went with his school!

<h>Brian from Merthyr Tydfil
<p>Going up to Crawshays grave in the early hours for a dare. Eerie by
   day.

<h>Emma Nicholson from Canterbury, soon moving to Cae
<p>Upstairs in the red house at the Museum of Welsh Life in St Fagans -
   there is a wooden cradle up there that seems to be the centre of the
   bad vibes in that building.

<h>David Osborne from Ely
<p>St Mary's church has many ghost stories. I haven't been there for
   years but it always freaked me out. It was always cold even in summer
   and it felt as though you were being watched from the woods
   surrounding it.

<h>Stacey Lewis from Merthyr Tydfil
<p>The Taf Trail is one scary place. I always see something everytime I
   go up there.

<h>Catherine from Caerau
<p>Me and my mates were in a library at our old school at Blaencaerau
   when books started coming from the shelves right at us. IT WAS RIGHT
   SCARY!!!!!!!

<h>Angharad and Amy From Merthyr
<p>We were at Cyfarthfa rehearsing for a play when we heard footsteps.
   Thinking it was our friend, we looked round the corner to say hi, only
   to find no-one there but a strange draft which made us feel like
   someone was watching us.

<h>Tony from Barry
<p>I saw a ghost in the Royal pub in Barry. I went to the gents on a
   quiet night and when I went into a loo there was a women stood in the
   corner by the sink just staring at the wall. I went out and told the
   landlady and she said don't worry, it's our ghost and she wont hurt
   you.

<h>Jenni
<p>St Briavel's youth hostel near Chepstow - the room I stayed in was
   called The Hanging Room - it actually felt like you were being
   watched. And all of the other rooms had names like that so it was very
   scary in some rooms!

<h>Nicole from Manchester
<p>Llancaiach Fawr - everytime I go I see weird faces on the walls and
   hear strange noises. It's weird yet strangely exciting!

<h>Amy Evans
<p>Llancaiach Fawr - wow, what a place... every room you walk into has a
   scary story to tell. You feel like you are being watched and followed.

<h>Christopher Queely in Maesteg
<p>Llangynwyd Church, where it is said that a young woman haunts... check
   it out.

<h>Kathleen Minton from Caerphilly
<p>Llanciach Fawr - we walked into what was the court room and I came
   over extremely dizzy and nauseous. Previous to this I was fine, but
   the instant I walked into that room I felt ill. After we came out of
   the room, one of my sons said he had similar feelings..very strange.

<h>Jason Hughes
<p>The Monkey Tree Hotel in Blackwood - it's very spooky in there and
   bedrooms 7, 8 and 9 are the most active with a ghost of a woman
   scaring visitors. Theres a portrait of her in the ladies' toilets
   apparently.

<h>Sarah from Abertridwr
<p>The Old Mill - I was out with friends playing hide and seek in the
   lanes behind the playing fields. It was dark and it was my turn to
   seek. I saw what I can only describe as a bright white light in the
   form of woman with a long flowing train behind her gliding diagonally
   from the Old Mill footbridge towards Abertridwr Park. It was quite
   scary at the time but I put it down to my imagination. Recently I
   spoke to my boyfriend about the event. He told me that he and his
   friend saw the exact same thing when they were younger. SPOOKY!

<h>Gemma Joseph from Cardiff
<p>Staff at the Anchor Inn, Tintern, have been scared out of their wits
   over the years. The spirit of a lady looking for her young son haunts
   the inn besides a spirit who plays a tin whistle outside as he did
   centuries ago. Ask the landlord! The atmosphere in the restaurant is
   so cold that thick curtains had to be put up where the old entrance to
   the boathouse stood.

<h>Jen and Claire
<p>We went on a ghost walk at Llancaiach Fawr and we heard footsteps, the
   sound of something heavy, like a table, being dragged along the floor,
   and a weird feeling in the colonel's room. It was even more scary
   knowing that we were locked in!!!

<h>Michelle in Cardiff
<p>I went to Llancaiach Fawr on a school trip when I was 9 and I'm sure
   that the eyes in the paintings were following me! I loved it there
   though and would definitely go again, even though it has been seven
   years since last time!

<h>Josephine Frances
<p>Cardiff Castle - the banqueting hall and the roof garden room where
   somone tugged at my friend's coat and playfully (?) pulled her hair!
   She refuses to visit the castle now.

<h>Catherine Stewart from Llanelli
<p>The Manor at the Museum of Welsh Life, St Fagans - everytime I go
   there I see mysterious flashing lights and always get the feeling that
   I am being watched by someone or something!

<h>Gavin Lewis from Cardiff
<p>The Brynglas tunnels on the M4 - everyone knows they are haunted.
   Strangely every day someone crashes whilst driving through a seemingly
   simple tunnel that neither deviates left to right or up or down. When
   you drive through it you think to yourself will it be me this time?

<h>Colin
<p>Kymin House in Penarth is haunted by an 18th century pirate, Captain
   Ramon Hill. I camped there in the summer of 1983 with friends and had
   to leave during the night because of unworldly disturbances.

<h>Steffan from Cardiff
<p>The Skirrid Mountain Inn - probably some of the many people that were
   hanged there! Still, you have to expect some strange spirits in Wales'
   oldest pub.

<h>Jodie Lunnon from Kenfig Hill
<p>Sker House - many ghost stories have come from this place. I have even
   seen the white lady of Sker on the 'mountains' (sand dunes) whilst
   fishing in the early hours of the morning off the rocks.

<h>Lynda Simpson in Central Tilba, Australia
<p>My grandfather's old farm at Summerleaze in Redwick - we were always
   scared that 'Tom the Lord' would rattle his chains and come for us in
   the middle of the night. There's a hedge that he sat on and nothing
   would grow there, and we couldn't sleep in the back bedroom because
   that was his favourite place.

<h>Katrien Vereecke
<p>The George Inn in St. Briavels is a cosy pub with a real ghost who
   used to be a monk years ago. He really exists and even blessed me two
   years ago. I really like him, but it is scary.

<h>Robyn Moss from Merthyr
<p>Cyfarthfa Castle is definitely scary.
