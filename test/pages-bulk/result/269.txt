<h>New Software Gives Kids Hands-Free Computer Control;
   CameraMouse Provides Disabled Siblings an Opportunity to Learn and
   Have Fun 

<p>Samantha Anastasia's kids are like most kids. Her daughter, Amanda,
   11, loves to go shopping, get her nails done and buy shoes. "It's all
   about the clothes. She's got quite a shoe collection," Samantha
   Anastasia said, laughing. For 6-year-old Daniel, it's all about cars,
   trucks and blowing up aliens on a computer game. Amanda, a
   fourth-grader at Hopatcong's Durban Avenue School, also can connect to
   educational software and play computer games, and she does most of her
   math, reading and spelling schoolwork on a computer screen. Her
   brother, a kindergartner at the Hudson Maxim School, is still just
   catching on to the system.

<p>The children's "can-do" list is getting longer, despite an unknown
   genetic disease that has caused them to lose most of their body
   movement. With the ability to make only small head movements,
   21st-century technology is helping them learn about the world around
   them while their bodies are in wheelchairs. "Ten years ago, the kids
   would have stopped trying to interact and they'd get mental atrophy,"
   said Timothy Frederiks, director of curriculum at the Hopatcong school
   district, where the Anastasia children have been mainstreamed into
   regular classrooms. "This is freedom for them."

<p>Amanda and Daniel's home computer is equipped with Mouse software that
   allows them hands-free control of their computer by using a
   high-definition video camera that tracks movements of their heads. The
   camera is positioned on top of the computer monitor. By moving their
   heads, they simultaneously move a cursor on a computer screen. By
   leaving their head in one position for a couple of seconds, the cursor
   "clicks," like a mouse, onto the computer function.

<p>Amanda and Daniel were born normally, but at the age of 10 months
   their motor skills began to regress. "They can move their arms and
   legs, but they are not functional, not purposeful" movements and
   cannot feed themselves, said their mother, Samantha Anastasia of
   Hopatcong, whose middle child, Nicholas, 8, does not have the
   mysterious malady. Anastasia and her husband, Daniel, first noticed
   that Amanda was regressing when she was an infant.
   "She was sitting and rocking but never crawled. Then she began sitting
   slumped over and holding her bottle in her teeth, almost as if she
   were getting lazy," her mother said. "Then she began falling over
   while sitting."

<p>Amanda's pediatrician sent them to a neurologist and a long series of
   tests, going from "doctor to doctor," followed. "We have a list of
   things that it's not. Every time a new disease or syndrome is
   discovered, we get the kids checked. We try to keep our hopes up," she
   said. By about 13 months of age, Amanda could not sit at all. And,
   some five years later, the Anastasias saw the same symptoms begin
   developing in their new baby, Daniel. "I knew at the first signs it
   was happening. So by 10 months, he was admitted to the hospital for
   tests and high doses of steroids. Thinking that because we caught this
   right in the beginning, we could either diagnose it or stop it.
   "Neither happened," she said.

<p>Samantha Anastasia first heard about the EagleEyes technology on a
   nightly TV news show in 2000 that featured a story about it being
   developed at Boston College. Soon afterward, Anastasia and her husband
   packed up their young family and Amanda's therapist, and went to
   Boston to find out more. "She immediately took off with it. I knew
   right then and there this could open so many doors for her," her
   mother said.

<p>And now her future is limitless, according to Philip DiMattia,
   director of the Campus School at Boston College who helped develop
   EagleEyes starting in 1995. "She's learning to read, write and spell
   using the technology," DiMattia said. "She's going to be on the cover
   of Newsweek in 10 to 15 years when she graduates from some big
   college.

<p>"Amanda's got a message for the whole world: There's no such thing as
   crippled intellect. Intellect is spiritual," said DiMattia, who visits
   with Amanda and her family about twice a year. "It's completely normal
   for Amanda to talk with her eyes because she can't talk with her
   mouth."

<p>Samantha Anastasia took her newfound knowledge back to Frederiks and
   other Hopatcong school officials, who took a subsequent trip to
   Boston. College officials later brought the technology to Hopatcong,
   where it is now in its third year. The technology is being used in 40
   to 50 schools worldwide, including about 20 schools in Northern
   Ireland. DiMattia knew of only one other school district in New
   Jersey, the Andover Regional district in Sussex County, that uses the
   system. The schools in Northern Ireland learned about EagleEyes
   through an exchange program but otherwise the system is distributed on
   a "roll-the-dice" basis, he said. "We'll bring the technology to
   wherever it's needed and will be put to use," DiMattia said.

<p>This year, the Hopatcong school district has acquired laptop computers
   for Amanda and Daniel to use in their classrooms. The laptops are used
   like desktop computers with the attachable camera requiring
   calibration prior to each use. "Most disabled people have been
   spectators all of their lives. Now with this technology they have a
   chance to be participants," DiMattia said.
