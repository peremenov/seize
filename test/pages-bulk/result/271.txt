<h>CBA Honours Exceptional BC Lawyers
<p>Whether they're improving the status of historically marginalized
   communities, supporting access to justice for the poor, or tirelessly
   volunteering for charitable organizations, lawyers are making a
   difference across BC. The Canadian Bar Association BC Branch
   recognizes the many unsung heroes in the legal profession who are
   quietly improving communities, and proudly congratulates the nominated
   recipients.
<h>Important Notice to Lawyers
<p>On August 17th, the Government of British Columbia issued additional
   guidelines to lawyers with respect to collection and remittance of the
   Social Services Tax on Legal Services. Read the guidelines. Read more

<h>The Registered Plan [Retirement Income] Exemption Act
   for British Columbia
<p>Read the CBABC brief submitted to the Ministry of Finance of British
   Columbia, as part of an advocacy campaign to extend protection from
   creditors for registered retirement savings. This is an important
   issue for many lawyers and others whose retirement savings are
   self-financed through registered plans rather than pensions (which are
   creditor protected).
