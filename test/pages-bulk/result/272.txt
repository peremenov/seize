<h>WEBQUEST

<P>Note:  Links updated January 2002.  Author takes no responsibility for
    redundant links.  Please notify author when links become redundant. 
<p>Note:  The SUBJECT SAMPLER and KNOWLEDGE HUNT should be completed
             before the WebQuest.  See also Being Australian. 
<h>Introduction

<p>Who are Australians? Where have they come from? In which ways do we
     perceive our 'Australianess'? Would we all answer these questions
     in the same way? Food for thought? Chew your way through this
     WebQuest to satisfy your hunger.

<h>The Question

<p>The main question you will be asked to find an answer for is: 

<p>What does it mean to be Australian?

<h>Background Information

<p>Have you already completed the Subject Sampler and the Knowledge
       Hunt?  If not, you should do both of these now to get some
       background on Oz and its people.  You could also check out some of
       these links:

<l>History of Immigration to Australia - from Convicts to the Gold
       Rush
<l>50 Years of Postwar Migration

<h>Individual Tasks

<p>Now that you have some overall background knowledge, it's time to
     return to the main question for this WebQuest. A questions this big
     and important is better answered when a few people are working on
     it at one time. Things work even better when a group of you decide
     to look at the question from different perspectives. This way team
     members can become experts on different aspects of the question and
     then come together to poll their learning. This is where team work
     pays off. So are you ready to divide and conquer this question?

<p>Form groups of six.  Each group member must research and answer the
     question from a different perspective:  Vietnamese; Aboriginal;
     Greek; Italian;  British/Irish; New Zealand.   Each group member
     will consider what it must be like to be a representative of our
     diverse population. 

<p>Group members must then re-form to answer the essential question:
     WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE AUSTRALIAN?

<p>Each group will present their thesis in the form of an oral
     presentation.  All six members must speak to the question for a
     period of no less than 3 minutes per speaker.  The team's oral
     presentation should be structured with an introduction, middle and
     conclusion (want help?) (which includes an answer to the
     question).

<h>Group Synthesis
<p>Congratulations!  Each person  on your team has become an expert on
       one group of Australians.
<p>Before you meet with your group, 
<p>Check out this site to help you review and
       organise your data.
<p>Guess what, gathering useful information isn't the same as truly
       understanding a topic. What experts in the field of learning
       suggest is that you now use that information in a new and
       challenging way. Then you'll really know about this topic. 
<p>So with you team members all gathered together, carefully read and
       try answering the main question for this WebQuest. See where you
       all agree and where differences arise.  Use information, pictures,
       movies, facts, opinions, etc you explored to convince your
       teammates that your viewpoint is important and should be part of
       your team's answer to the question. Your WebQuest team should
       arrive at  an answer that everyone on the team can live with. 
<p>Check out this site for help with structuring
       your oral presentation.
<p>Before your group presents its findings, ask yourselves these
       questions:

<l>Have we worked co-operatively as a group?
<l>Are we prepared to give our answer? (practise!)
<l>Is our presentation structured?
<l>Do we need to prepare any resources?
<l>Are our speaking roles evenly distributed?
<l>Is the correct question being addressed?
<l>What have we learnt?


<p>Your group can now present its thesis in the form of an oral
   presentation.  All six members must speak to the question for a period
   of no less than 3 minutes per speaker.  The team's oral presentation
   should be structured with an introduction, middle and conclusion
   (which includes an answer to the question).
<h>Real World Feedback
<p>Research contacts you can make for each of the six ethnic groups and
       write a letter to each of them asking  for an answer to the
       question:  What Does it Mean to be Australian?  Compare/contrast
       your conclusions with the replies.

<h>Conclusion

<p>At the beginning of this activity, you were asked about the truth.
     Did you discover it? Was there only one? Did everyone on your team
     think so? How did you answer the main question for this WebQuest? 

<p>You deserve a lot of praise for all the work you've done. And so
     does your brain. You've sure put that gray stuff to the test. You
     gained background information, developed expertise in one
     particular area and got into some pretty expert analysis. At times,
     you must have felt confused with ideas spinning every which way.
     That's normal when you're building new mental connections. It's
     funny, with each link between what you already knew and the new
     learning going on, you broke another different kind of link,
     remember the intellectual slavery we spoke about earlier? You're
     free! How will you use these ideas and strategies as you continue
     to grow and learn? It's all up to you. Good luck.

<h>Evaluation 
<p>You will be evaluated on the following:

<l>organisation of content 
<l>clarity of voice
<l>audibility
<l>posture
<l>preparedness (confident approach)
<l>use of  visual resources
<l>expressive voice
<l>use of gestures
<l>fluency
<l>eye contact with audience
<l>audience involvement/reaction
