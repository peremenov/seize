<h>THE PRACTICAL GUIDE TO MASS FINISHING OF PRECIOUS AND COSTUME JEWELRY:
METHODS AND MYTHS

<h>Steven R. Alviti, Bel Air Finishing Supply Inc.
<h>CONTENTS

<h>ABSTRACT

<p>A microscopic and technical view of mass finishing presented in
   layman's terms. Understanding of mass finishing must start at the very
   basic level of what happens microscopically to the surface of various
   materials. All the variables will be discussed, such as the media,
   compounds and the effect of various types of machinery on the
   finishing process. Practical techniques and the associated costs will
   be presented for pre-finishing of precious metal jewelry as well as
   costume or imitation jewelry

<h>INTRODUCTION

<p>This article is an explanation of Mass Finishing from a practical
   standpoint. The views discussed here are a result of 30 years of
   experience in manufacturing jewelry, job shop processing for many
   diverse manufacturing industries as well as experience in designing
   and manufacturing of finishing equipment. Historically, the mass
   finishing department of many companies have not received the attention
   or understanding required to serve the best interests of the
   manufacturer's finished product. Typically, manufacturers migrate to
   opposite ends of the spectrum with regards to their finishing
   department. It is either in the remotest location of their facility
   and the attitude is "well that's the way we have always done it" or
   they have instituted a sophisticated system without the proper
   understanding of the economics or the reality of everyday jewelry
   manufacturing. There is no best way of finishing a product. Before any
   changes are made to a finishing department, the manufacturer must
   address the importance of several aspects before making a decision.

   Equipment Loss of Material from Product

<h>III MEDIA - COMPOUNDS

<h>A. DEFINITION

<p>The word media is used to describe the material that is used in mass
   finishing to actually do the work on the surface of the part that is
   being finished. The compound refers to the different types of
   chemicals used during wet mass finishing operations.

<h>B. FUNCTION OF MEDIA

<p>The functions of media are varied and range from rough cutting to
   polishing. ROUGH CUTTING of the raw product is to remove all possible
   surface imperfections. Depending upon the manufacturing process, some
   hand work may be necessary prior to this mass finishing step. Raw gold
   casting must have the sprue cut off and ground down to the surface. In
   the case of a white metal rubber molded piece, usually no hand
   operation is necessary. However, each case depends on the
   manufacturing process. The rough cut is to remove the surface
   imperfections of the material due to its fabrication technique. (i.e.
   casting, rolling, forming, etc.) This is the stage where mass
   finishing plays its biggest role in labor savings. Typically, mass
   finishing can save 50 - 75% of the hand labor used to finish a piece
   of jewelry. FIG. 1-3

<p>The rough cut is almost always done as a wet operation with media,
   water and compound. The labor savings is most obvious for cast
   materials due to the inherent roughness of the "as cast" surface.
   PRE-FINISHING is the term used for the operation following the rough
   cut stage. The pre-finishing step is usually done prior to machine
   polishing, hand polishing or electroplating. The purpose is to
   increase the smoothness of the "rough cut" surface so as to make the
   polishing or electroplating procedure more effective. In order for a
   product to be machine polished or a combination of machine and hand
   polished, this step is most necessary. If the product is going to be
   hand polished or electroplated, this step may or may not be necessary.
   This would depend upon whether the labor saving is worth the time
   investment. A question quality versus cost must also be taken into
   consideration. The pre-finishing operation is almost always done as a
   wet operation with media, water and a compound. MACHINE POLISHING is
   very economical where applicable. It can save up to 95% of hand
   finishing labor costs; however, many facto must be considered for this
   step to be viable. This is usually a dry procedure using a natural
   carrier and a powdered compound without water. Fig. 4 BURNISHING is
   used to render the surface of a product bright by J means of rolling
   over a surface with a non-abrasive media such as steel or porcelain.
   This method physically peens the surface in order to increase light
   reflectivity which, in turn, will make the surface appear bright. This
   media is the heaviest available and is used with water and compound.

<h>C. MEDIA TYPES

<p>There are a variety of different media for different applications:

<p>Normally, there are two components of CUTTING MEDIA:
<l>abrasive grains and
<l>carrier or bonding agents

<p>Abrasive grains for cutting media can be any of the following:
<l>Silicone carbide - most aggressive
<l>Aluminum oxide - moderately aggressive
<l>Silica- least aggressive

<p>Bonding materials can be (FIG 8 ):
<l>Ceramic - hard
<l>Plastic - soft
<l>Natural - range soft to hard

<p>PRE-POLISHING MEDIA is much the same as cutting media with exception
   of the size of the grain that is bound into the media. Pre-finishing
   media is also used to perform a cutting operation; however, much more
   gentle and finer than the rough cut media.

<p>BURNISHING MEDIA has no abrasive grain. This media is used simply to
   roll over or hammer away at the surface with the sole purpose of
   making it bright. This media is typically made from either very heavy
   lain or solid steel.

<p>POLISHING MEDIA is generally made of a natural base material as wood,
   shell or corn cob. Polishing compounds, very similar to used in hand
   polishing bars, are bound to the natural base by means wax or oil
   based product.

<h>D. MEDIA SIZES AND SHAPES.

<p>The various types of media are available in many shapes and sizes.
   When choosing sizes and shapes, one must consider the geometry of the
   being processed and choose the largest media possible that will
   fulfill the following criteria: 1. The shape chosen will best be able
   to touch every part of the surface of the work pieces. 2. The size
   will facilitate easy separation (i.e. either the media or the piece
   can be sifted through an existing separating screen).

<h>E. FINISHING COMPOUNDS

<p>Finishing compounds are either liquid or powder and are as additives
   to the water being used during any of the mass finishing operations
   There are three purposes for compounds (1) The compound is form of
   soap used to suspend the solids being removed from the surface the
   product (much like dishwashing soap). (2) The prevention of oxidation
   or discoloration of the metals being processed. (3) The addition
   lubricity to the process. The proper compounds form a cushion between
   the media and the work piece, which allows a sliding action which in
   turn, reduces impingement of the abrasive. Compounds are used both
   types of processing. The first is called a batch operation where a
   prescribed amount of media, water and compound are placed in a sealed
   process chamber. The second is called a flow-thru operation where a
   prescribed amount of water and compound continuously flow in and out
   of open processing chamber of media. Theoretically, compounds are most
   likely to be changed for a particular metal being processed as well as
   for a particular step (i.e. rough cut, pre-finish etc.) In reality;
   however, this is less likely to be specifically matched to the
   purpose. Most manufacturers settle on one "all purpose compound" best
   suited for their needs.

<h>F. HOW MEDIA AND COMPOUNDS WORK

<p>Mass finishing media works basically in the same manner as the
   materials used in hand finishing. FIG 10 a-d
<p>The main difference is that a machine is used to apply the force
   through the tool to the work piece. The other difference is that a
   mass of pieces are being processed rather than one piece at a time.
   Hence, the name Mass Finishing. FIG 11
<p>In order to perform the CUTTING OPERATION, we must choose the best
   combination of abrasive grain, bonding material, size, shape and the
   proper compound to use during the process. The cutting media works in
   the same manner as a grinding wheel. A force is required to rub the
   media across the surface of the work piece. FIG 12
<p>At the point of contact of media and the work piece, abrasive grains
   are exposed at the surface of the media and rubbed across the work
   piece, microscopically cutting material from its surface. As material
   is being cut away from the work piece, the abrasive grains are
   becoming dull as they do their job. FIG 13a,b
<p>Meanwhile, the bonding material is wearing away so as to rid the media
   of these dull abrasive grains and to expose new sharp grains to
   continue the cutting process. The water and compound are used to
   cushion this effect as well as to remove all of the waste (used
   abrasive grains, bonding material, work piece surface material) from
   the operation. Economics now come into play when choosing the proper
   cutting media.
<p>The faster a media cuts, the faster it normally wears which equates to
   dollars per finishing operation. If the bonding agent of the media
   does not wear fast enough, the abrasive grains may not perform as
   effective as they should. There is an optimal wear ratio between the
   bond and the grain. If this ratio is not correct, the media is less
   cost effective. Regardless of these microscopic costs, the overall
   economic scale of labor saving, material loss and overall time savings
   make mass finishing a sure bet.

<p>THE PRE-POLISHING OPERATION is practically the same as the cutting
   media except the bonding material is usually harder and the abrasive
   grain size is smaller. In some cases, the abrasive grain is in the
   form of slender finer shape. By rubbing over the surface with a
   greater low of water and a compound that lubricates more effectively,
   a gentle honing action occurs. The purpose is to reduce the surface to
   a finer/smoother finish. Typically, the wear of pre-polishing media is
   much less than that of cutting media. We are less interested in
   removing metal, than we are in reducing the surface finish.
<p>The POLISHING OPERATION is normally done as a dry process, the media
   in this case is either of several natural products like wood round up
   corn cob or nut shells. In this case, there is no water flow and, the
   compound is dry and bonded to the carrier. Some typical compounds are
   alumina and tin oxide, which are the same compounds used for hand
   polishing In this case, the rubbing action of the media is meant to
   -plicate the action of a polishing wheel rubbing polishing compound
   over the surface of the work piece. As long as the surface has
   previously been rendered smooth and flat, this process will now
   produce a high luster to the surface. This operation usually takes a
   much longer time than the rough cut and pre-polish. The finish that is
   achieved with this method is very good; however, it will never be
   equal to that of a hand polished finish No mass finishing machine has
   been able to duplicate the force and action necessary to compare to
   hand polishing. Hand polishing actually over the surface of the work
   piece by dragging metal whereas machine polishing only glosses the
   existing surface. During this operation, due tog the fact that it is a
   dry process, heat is generated by the friction of the in moving This
   heat is beneficial to the process because it helps activate it
   polishing compound itself; therefore, it is helpful to retain as much
   of the .at generated by covering the process. Unlike cutting and
   pre-polishing' media, the polishing media has a life span, after which
   it is no longer effective This is due to the fact that the polishing
   compound is only bonded to the surface of the media as opposed to the
   abrasive grain being 81 bound throughout the whole composition.
   However, once this media has been expended, it can be re-charged for
   several more cycles before being discarded.
<p>BURNISHING MEDIA is typified by the lack of abrasives and a hard and
   extremely smooth surface. The purpose of burnishing is to brighten the
   surface of a material by means of peening the surface. The correlation
   that we use to explain this is if one took a plain dull piece of brass
   and a ball peen hammer. After repeatedly hammering the surface, it
   will then take on brightness imparted by the surface of the ball peen
   will hammer.

<p>Steel or stainless shot as well as porcelain balls are the typical
   media of choice for burnishing. These are usually the heaviest
   materials available and they are processed to have a microscopically
   smooth and shiny surface finish.

<h>IV MACHINES 

<p>The media is what actually performs the surface finishing. The
   compound allows this work to be done efficiently but it is the machine
   that provides the energy to do all the work. There are several
   different types of mass finishing machines, all of which have a
   different method of transferring energy from an electric motor to the
   media to the work piece.
<p>The TUMBLING MACHINE is the oldest form of mass finishing equipment. A
   motor is attached to the gear box by means of a pulley and belt. The
   gear box rotates an octagonal finishing chamber which is either
   submerged in water or contains water in its chamber. The chamber
   should be loaded with between 50% and 60% of the total chamber volume.
   About 15% to 25% of the total mass should be work pieces In this
   equipment, the pieces are only being worked on as the media and pieces
   tumble down the incline of the rotating barrel. Meanwhile, as the mass
   rotates up to the top of the incline, there is no movement of media
   with respect to workpiece; therefore, no work is (D 83 being done.
   This type of operation is still effective for limited applications
   with longer time cycles and a low quality finish.

<h>Efficiencies of Tumblers:

<p>Good for low cost, low quality finishes Good for cutting & de-burring
   flat stackable work pieces Good for low cost, low quality burnishing
   Deficiencies of Tumblers: Labor intense for volume processing Not
   effective for polishing Not effective to pre-polishing Flow-through
   compound system not available More apt to get part on part impingement
   Will not finish parts with deep recesses

<p>THE VIBRATORY TUB MACHINE was the next generation of mass finishing
   equipment. It took the same basic idea of the tumbling machine but
   created a new and more efficient means of transferring energy from the
   motor to the tub. The chamber is "U" shaped and suspended on springs.
   The shaft with eccentric weights is attached to the chamber and is
   rotated by means of a belt and pulley attached to the motor. There are
   still some of the same inherent problems in this process as in
   tumbling but now we have incorporated a flow-through compound system
   and vibratory action for more efficiency.

<p>The VIBRATORY BOWL machine was the next generation of mass finishing
   and remains the most popular and most effective to date. The
   processing chamber is the shape of a hollowed doughnut laying on its
   side. A motor is attached to a shaft with eccentric weights which is
   fixed to the bowl shaped chamber which is suspended on springs. The
   ensuing action causes the mass to travel in a three dimensional
   toroidal motion.

<p>This type of action allows for the most efficient processing of work
   pieces. The work chamber can almost be filled to capacity as well as
   allowing the high concentration of work pieces in relationship to the
   mass.

<p>Efficiencies of Vibratory Bowl:
<l>Highest quality finish
<l>Low maintenance
<l>Allows flow-through operation
<l>Low labor cost for operating
<l>Minimizes processing load


<p>HIGH ENERGY BARREL MACHINES operate basically the same as tumbling
   barrels with one major difference - centrifugal energy is added to the
   process to dramatically reduce the processing time. This is
   accomplished by mounting several barrels in a ferris wheel type
   arrangement and spinning the complete apparatus as each barrel is
   rotating.

<p>Except for the extra force applied to the media and work piece, all
   the draw-backs of tumbling are still inherent. An additional drawback
   is that the equipment now becomes very expensive as well. Processing
   time is one positive feature of the apparatus.

<p>The HIGH ENERGY DISC finishing machines have been developed to take
   advantage of the three dimensional action of a vibratory bowl and the
   reduced processing time of centrifugal force machines. The energy is
   transferred from a motor to a gear box in order to rotate a central
   disc at the bottom of a round stationary chamber. Centrifugal force
   and the rotating action sends the mass outward towards the stationary
   wall. The mass then slows down and returns to the center to complete
   the cycle.

<p>This method incorporates the ability to have flow-through processing
   and high energy. The major drawback to this equipment lies in the disc
   seal. This is the machine part that lies between the stationary bowl
   and rotating center. A precision opening must be maintained so as to
   allow the flow-through water and debris to escape. The inherent
   problem is that abrasives are constantly flowing through a moving
   seal. This makes for a maintenance nightmare besides the high initial
   expense of the equipment. Process time reduction is the benefit
   derived from this equipment. The latest development in mass finishing
   equipment is a machine designed for the specific purpose of
   burnishing.

<p>The ROLL BURNISHING machine is a completely new drive mechanism for
   the oldest of techniques, burnishing.

<p>This new machine is a form of high energy ball burnishing. It operates
   by rotating a belt in a tub shape configuration while submerged in a
   rectangular tub of water and compound. Not only does this facilitate a
   much faster cycle, there is also the point of impingement on all tubs,
   which has been eliminated because of the roll under effect created by
   the belt This is also the only tub style burnisher that allows the
   possibility of a flow-through compound system. Beyond this, the system
   has a unique unload system that is incredibly labor saving. A
   specially made sieving basket is emerged into the mass and removed
   with just the work pieces. No media has to ever be handled by the
   operator. It takes less than one minute to completely unload work
   pieces.

<p>The MAGNETIC PIN FINISHER has been developed to burnish the nooks and
   crannies and far reaches of jewelry products. The machine uses a motor
   to spin a magnet beneath a flat table. The finishing chamber contains
   very fine steel needles or pins with the water and compound mix. The
   work pieces are placed in the chamber and covered. The cylindrical
   chamber is placed on top of the table. The magnets are rotated in a
   circular path that matches the bottom of the chamber. This causes the
   steel pins to stand up and rotate. The collision of the magnet driven
   pins with the work piece causes the mass to rotate at the same time as
   the pins hammer the surface of the work piece.

<h>V. MACHINE EFFECTIVENESS / COST RELATIONSHIP

<h>A. MACHINE COST EFFECTIVENESS

<p>The main purpose of mass finishing is to economize the finishing
   operation of all jewelry products. Other reasons vary according to the
   situation. In Italy and the U.S., hand finishing labor is very costly.
   In China, the labor is cheap. The worker training and consistency are
   the issues . In some other countries, the main issue is the loss of
   gold from the raw casting to the finished product. The type of mass
   finishing is determined by these and other parameters:

<h>B. COMMON FINISHING MYTHS

<h>1. Many customers purchase plastic media based on lowest cost

<p>Plastic media is made of two parts, a polyester resin bonding agent
   and abrasive grain. The most expensive part of the media is the resin
   bonding agent. In order to decrease the cost of selling plastic media,
   an increase percentage of abrasive can be mixed into the media. The
   problem is - the more grain, the faster the media wears, which
   actually makes it more expensive to operate. Another way to decrease
   the cost of selling plastic media is to use a less expensive bonding
   agent. Urea Formaldehyde has been used as a less expensive bonding
   agent, which again increases the wear rate and hence is more expensive
   to operate with this media.

<h>2. Urea Formaldehyde bonded plastic media is cheaper to use and easier
   to settle out in your waste water system

<p>Urea Formaldehyde or UF media was developed to fight the increased
   cost of using the standard polyester based resin bonding agents.
   Because it obviously wears out faster, some other benefit must have to
   be touted to over-ride this defect. Actually its initial cost is less.
   It does not make waste treatment any easier and it is more expensive
   to operate.

<h>3. Ceramic cutting media costs less and wears longer

<p>This is a true statement. We see this approach quite often in the Far
   East. The fact is that, because the media is harder and does not wear
   out, it does not cut the surface. If you are dealing with soft metals,
   as we often do for jewelry products, ceramic media for cutting is not
   practical because the surface of the media "loads up" with metal
   before it can wear to the next level of cutting. Therefore, the media
   only works in a manner of burnishing the surface.

<h>4. High energy disc finishers give a better finish than Vibratory

<p>The action of both a disc finisher and a vibratory finisher is
   basically the same with respect of the mass traveling in a three
   dimensional motion. Assuming the media and compound are the same, the
   only difference is t some added centrifugal force is being used in the
   operation. That alone cannot produce a better finish. Faster - yes,
   but not better. The simple fact that a particular grit media is rubbed
   over a work piece surface is what defines the degree of smoothness
   achieved. An example would be rubbing a 200 grit sand paper on a
   surface. No matter how hard or how t it was rubbed, it still remains a
   fact that you could not get better than 00 grit finish.

<h>5. "After casting, put your piece in a pin machine and it is finished"

<p>I heard this absurd statement from finished goods manufacturers coming
   out a seminar at a trade show. The statement may be true for the
   purpose of cleaning a raw casting; however, it actually deteriorates
   any broad surface t needs polishing. A pin machine is strictly for
   pronged and recessed as or the lowest quality bright finish. This is
   used to finish these hard to reach areas in conjunction with other
   mass finishing or hand finishing.

<h>6. The European technique saves time

<p>This technique is to use a plain media with no abrasive as a carrier
   and then to add abrasive grit for .ting. This is done in a batch
   operation as a slurry. Once the first cycle complete, it is then
   flushed. The batch is then run with a finer grit led and flushed
   again. This system saves an unloading operation; however, it
   sacrifices results. Finishing by this method would be as if one took a
   piece of paper and a sprinkle of sand and started to rub a piece as
   posed to using a piece of sandpaper. Although the unloading between
   finishing steps has been eliminated, the operation itself is very
   inefficient.

<h>7. The machine does not work

<p>Many times, after a manufacturer has purchased a machine and has
   embarked on mass finishing, they call and say "the machine does not
   work". My response is to ask several questions: a. Did you plug the
   machine in? b. Did you turn the machine on? c. Does the machine shake?
   or spin? If they answer yes to all of these questions, my response is
   "the machine works". The problem is that the technique the
   manufacturer is using is not producing what the manufacturer expected.
   He may have been misinformed, uninformed or misdirected. It is
   important to remember, although mass finishing is relatively
   straightforward once a process has been established, there are many
   variables to consider. The technology is the most important thing to
   consider when making a purchase. Just as in making a decision to
   purchase jewelry software, you should be dealing with a supplier who
   concentrates in the industry and is always updating their technology.

<h>8. Internal separation in a vibratory machine saves time

<p>Some vibratory finishing machines have a built in dam that, when
   closed, allows the mass to rise and pass over a screen which allows
   the media to return into the bowl and the work pieces shake across the
   screen and out of the bowl. The idea seems efficient; however, in
   reality, there is so much variation in jewelry components that it
   becomes a laborer's nightmare to change screens and find missing parts
   that never rise over the screen. internal separation is never 100%
   effective. It reduces the capacity of the machine and it causes longer
   down time for the unload cycle. An operator should be able to unload
   and reload a vibratory bowl up to 3 cubic feet in less than 10 minutes
   using an external separator.

<h>VI CONSUMER EXPECTATIONS DICTATE TECHNIQUES

<p>Ther is no best way to mass finish. The consumer who will eventually
   purchase the finished jewelry product is the one who actually dictates
   the finishing technique to be used by the manufacturer. For instance,
   let's manufacture a pair of gold earrings set with diamonds. The
   estimated retail value will be $2000 US dollars and it will be sold in
   an upscale jewelry store. The gold castings would probably be run in
   some type of mass finishing cutting cycle and then hand polished with
   several steps: the settings may be hand burnished and then the stones
   would be hand set and, finally, hand glossed again. Now let's use that
   same wax model and make a $ 100 US dollar pair of gold earrings with a
   cast in CZ that will be sold to Wal-Mart Stores. We would probably run
   that same gold casting through a three step mass finishing process
   that would give us a "near" polished finish. The final operation may
   be a quick hand gloss with a polishing wheel. Next, let's take the
   same wax model and make a pair of gold earrings to sell one of the
   world's latest consumers, a Mainland Chinese laborer. First, we will
   move the stone and now have a target retail of $40.00 US dollars. The
   manufacturer now may only have to do a simple burnishing operation to
   bring up the shine and color of the gold. Each one of the above
   consumer has a different level of expectation with regards to the
   product resulting in each product being processed by a different mass
   finishing technique. The end result is that each consumer is equally
   pleased with his or her purchase. The same scenario is true for
   costume jewelry. There is no best way. ere are many techniques
   developed for varying degrees of quality and economy Whether the
   product has been stamped, cast, machined or molded be it made from
   precious metal, base metal, plastic or wood, there are many machines
   and media available for mass finishing. The most effective to date
   remains the Vibratory Bowl Finisher.

<h>NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN WASTE WATER TREATMENTS

<p>New developments in treating effluent have progressed nicely from the
   set of jewelry mass finishing. In the early days, environmental
   restrictions were tremendous hurdles to overcome for many
   manufacturers. In most recent years, systems have been developed that
   make it a lot easier for manufacturers to efficiently process their
   vibratory me. The following are some methods currently used in many
   systems.

<l>Polymer Flocculation

<l>Filter Presses

<l>Ultra Filtration

<l>Resin Columns

<h>Recycling Methods
<p>The current technology now allows for the effluent to RECYCLE thru
   vibratory system. This eliminated the need to discharge water while
   saving in compound cost at the same time. In some parts of the world,
   the laws are not strict enough to make this necessary but we would
   hope that manufacturers will be environmentally responsible. Once the
   effluent has been treated, costume jewelry manufacturers now must deal
   with the disposal of sludge waste that has been extracted from the
   water. This sludge has typically been defined as hazardous waste and
   trucked away at about $200 per drum.
<p>The latest development in WATER TREATMENT CHEMISTRY now encapsulates
   up to 99% of the soluble and insoluble metals from the effluent. The
   sludge, after air drying, now transforms into cement like material. In
   most cases, this allows the waste to be classified as non hazardous
   which allows dumping in land fills. For precious jewelry
   manufacturers, this simple 15 minute procedure allows them to recover
   the most gold or platinum ever attainable without waiting for days of
   natural settling or messy evaporation techniques.
