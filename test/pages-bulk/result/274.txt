<h>Wanted: Dead or Alive

<p>Someone got to B.D. via this Google search today (too lazy to click
   through? The search: "bin laden has not been heard from since").

<p>Well, since when? Since May 7th of this year when an (unauthenticated)
   audiotape emerged purporting to be UBL offering gold in return for
   Jerry Bremer's assasination. Pretty piddling fare for Osama, no?
   Reduced to offering grams of gold for the head of a mere American
   proconsul? Note that was about half a year ago.

<p>Before that, there was that "truce" offer--ostensibly for the benefit
   of those baddies in 'New' Europe--back on April 15th (also, as far as
   I can tell, unauthenticated). And on January 4 of this year, another
   audiotape purporting to be Bin Laden aired on al-Jazeera.
   Interestingly, that was the first audio in which, according to the
   Guardian (ed. note: Did I just write that phrase straight-faced?],
   "the voice introduces itself as Osama bin Laden at the beginning of
   the tape." This raises my suspicion a little. After all, why must the
   great Sheikh explain it is He who is doing the speaking? Still,
   ostensibly, at least some analysts judged the audio to likely be
   authentic. But other reports I've seen are more cautious about
   confirming its authenticity [ed. note: The Beeb vs. CBS!?! I link, you
   decide!]

<p>The last video (rather than audio) tape? You have to go back to
   October 19th, 2003--about a year ago. But there is no voiceover, no
   attempt to evidence the date of the footage, and UBL appears "healthy"
   (in sharp contrast to a gaunt-looking UBL in December of '01)

<p>Before then? A video on September 11, 2003. But there is no real time
   voice on this video either:

<p>The tape shows a figure believed to be Bin Laden, the leader of the
     al-Qaida network, dressed in Afghan-style robes and walking in
     rocky mountainous terrain, apparently accompanied by his chief
     lieutenant, Ayman al-Zawahiri. It was aired on the Arab television
     network al-Jazeera.

<p>The men do not address the camera. But on a soundtrack accompanying
     the tape Zawahiri is heard exhorting fighters in Iraq to rise up
     against the occupying forces and "devour the Americans". He names
     the US president, George Bush, and Tony Blair as the "top
     criminals".

<p>Funny, just two weeks later, Zawahiri releases a tape. Solo. Why not
   do a joint audio since, just a couple weeks back, they were strolling
   through the mountains together?

<p>Next, check out this timeline. Note that al-Qaeda released three tapes
   between December '02 and April '03.

<p>None featured UBL! Why?

<p>After that, there was the November '03 audio tape, again purporting to
   be UBL's voice, that claimed responsibility for Bali etc. But, Swiss
   scientists deem it likely a fake.

<p>Next, continuing in reverse chronological order? A tape where al-Qaeda
   formally take responsibility for 9/11--on Sept 10 2002. Again, it's
   supposed to be UBL--but note, per the Guardian: "There was nothing to
   indicate that the sound-only recording attributed to Bin Laden had
   been made since the war in Afghanistan."

<p>On June 23rd of '02, al-Q spokesman Abu Ghaith informs us UBL is
   alive. Why does he need to so proclaim? Why doesn't UBL tell us
   himself?

<p>Other videos? April 15th, 2002 (again, no speaking; no confirmation
   this is post Afghanistan).

<p>Folks, bottom line: we have to go all the way back to December 26th
   2001 to see a video of UBL that really seems to get close to passing a
   smell test evidencing that's he actually, you know, alive (and he
   didn't look too smashing in it either).

<p>Now, does anyone seriously believe that UBL wouldn't, if he were
   alive, be doing his very damnedest to release a tape, soonest, rubbing
   Bush's nose in it for not having caught him--dead or alive? Just as a
   little pre-election present, say, maybe to give the opposition a
   little assist in hyping the disingenous Tora Bora meme? Doubtless, he
   would, no? Unless, of course, he's dead. Which, I'm beginning to feel
   pretty comfortable concluding, may well be the happy reality as we sit
   here today.

<p>What gives me a little pause? Well, here's one thing. This recent
   Lally Weymouth interview of Pervez Musharraf. After all, wouldn't the
   good general be one of the best positioned people, on the planet, to
   have a pretty good feel for whether UBL is dead or not?

<p>Weymouth: Do you think Osama bin Laden can be captured? We don't know
   where he is. Is he alive?

<p>Musharraf: Most likely, almost certainly. [emphasis added]

<p>But then why, in this 
   interview, did Musharraf say: "I think now, frankly, he is dead for
   the reason he is a ... kidney patient."

<p>What happened between Lally Weymouth's interview (UBL "almost
   certainly" alive and the old 2002 interview: "I think now, frankly, he
   is dead...")?

<p>Well, I don't know, of course. But let me go out on a limb--Musharraf
   notwithstanding. I think Osama bin Laden is dead. And, if so, you
   might as well chalk that up, of course, on the positive side of the
   ledger vis-a-vis Bush's prosecution of the war on terror during his
   first term. Oh, be sure to think about that the next time you hear
   hysterical chiming-ons about all those myriad missed opportunities at
   Tora Bora and such.

<p>Is all the above speculative, circumstantial, merely musings from the
   'over here'? Yes, of course. But isn't it all pretty plausible and/or
   convincing? Sure, I'll have a huge amount of egg on my face should a
   convincing audio or video of him pop up in the next weeks and months.
   But, I gotta think, smart money would be betting he's dead rather than
   alive hunkered down in a back alley in Karachi.

<p>(Um, guess Karl Rove is going to have to come up with a different
   October surprise...)
