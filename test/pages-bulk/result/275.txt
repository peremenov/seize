<h>JANUARY 13TH, 2005

<p>Hi

<p>I just got in from an award ceremony. We were voted The Best Scottish Band Of All Time by the readers of The List magazine. Ha ha! I missed the bloody
   prizegiving, got there too late, but apparantly Stevie made a very
   nice acceptence speech.

<p>The Best Scottish Band Of All Time! Thats going to piss a few people
   off.

<p>Im going off to bed, but I thought Id pinch a few questions off the q
   and as since they were quite long, and stick them here. These were
   ones I did earlier

<p>I like it how some of you seem to be getting right down to some
   serious issues! Or even some not so serious ones! I'm not sure if I'm
   the man for the job, but I'll try my best!

<h>From Elen

<p>Hello Stuart, I hope you're well. I'm a 15 year-old from Wales, I
   regularly go to church, and once a month I play the organ (badly). I
   once played 4 verses of "Morning has broken" with the biggest hairy
   brown spider sat a few inches away from my lap, watching me. The thing
   is that even though I consider myself to be a christian, I feel more
   of a sense of duty to play the organ in church, rather than really
   feeling that I want to. I do enjoy it, but maybe not for the right
   reasons. I grew up in this small village and went to the local primary
   and Sunday school etc. So I feel that I can't let the people who have
   steered me through my life so far down. Do you think that this is
   really a reason to be christian? Because my Mum says that through
   wanting to help and please others, I am being christian, but I feel a
   bit disillusioned towards it personally. This is a bit of a scrappy
   question, but I hope you can give an opinion on this. Thank you for
   you time. With Kind Regards, Elen. P.S. Do you think spiders can be
   religious? Or sing "Morning has broken"?

<p>Lets get this straight, Elen. You aint a Christian unless you believe
   that a man was nailed on a cross until dead. He was buried, and he
   rose from the dead to sit by Gods right hand in heaven, to be our
   guide and saviour. Thats probably a bit of a harsh thing to say to a
   15 year old, but let me qualify it.

<p>The issue of how old you are is important. What did I know/believe
   when I was fifteen? I believed in Newtonian mechanics. I believed in
   getting out and earning money for myself. I believed that Yes made the
   best music and that my brother was an annoying dick. I belived that
   life would get better when I made it to the big city.

<p>No mention of God there. I think at that time I even still trailed
   along to bible class, but it meant little to me. (At least, I thought
   it meant little to me; it means more to me now) What Im getting at is
   that you are allowed time to find things out for yourself. You
   actually have your whole life to decide whether you are a Christian or
   not.

<p>Meanwhile, I suppose by wanting to help and please others you are
   being a decent, regular sort of person. Its good; christian with a
   small c. Nothing to do with a cross, just a term thats been
   appropriated in modern life.

<p>Going to church, playing the organ; if it makes you feel good, do it.
   If it bore the tits off you, dont! I tell you what though, I think its
   pretty cool. I also think that when youre older and you look back
   youll be glad you did it.

<p>Hope that helps. Take care.

<p>Hi,Stuart.Yesterday, I was watching "Fans Only" for my first time and
   as appeared your scenes, I realised that you ARE MY TYPE of man!!!I'm
   not kidding, it's serious.The way your eyes seemed mysterious and at
   the same time, too beautiful...and I also instantly fell in love with
   your eyebrows (I think they remind me that Japanese Cartoon-Dragon
   Ball Z, when Goku reaches Sayajin's third form;Have you ever watched
   it?).Unfortunately,I'm seventeen and by now, I have no hope.Well,
   these are my questions: How old are you? Are you committed or single?
   That's all.Kiss on your cheek ^^x

<p>Yes, Natalia, as you are seventeen, you fall into the same age
   category as some of my charges in the Youth Club at my church.
   Therefore, from me you can expect some hastily improvised Christian
   guidance and a bit of a sing-song.

<p>I am more than twice your age! You would learn to make fun of my
   eyebrows like the rest of the kids, and soon be bored by my over
   serious nature and obsessions with antiquated modes of urban
   transport!

<p>Your letter is appreciated though; I do wish you all the best.

<p>Ps. In answer to your other queries (a) I didnt realise I had a facial
   similarity to Mr Ballz. (b) I was nearly commited once

<p>ok, i feel sort of guilty; i'be been greedy with this q and a thing. i
   just discovered it a few days ago, and it's so cold and rainy and
   dismal. my yoga class was canceled, and my classical indian dance
   teacher (who is usually comforting and peaceful) is depressed because
   her father died last week. so, you're my audience/my confessor.
   church. i'm the prodigal daughter, but i haven't returned. i'm afraid.
   is god just another pipe dream? like romantic love? i'm 2 years from
   30, which could be mid life, if i die at 60. i'm the unofficial
   godmother to the daughter of a Hindu friend of mine. i'm supposed to
   find a place where she can be baptized. not sure i'm the girl for this
   -- i can't go into a church. i listened to joan baez singing ave maria
   in german the other day and broke down in tears, not happy tears. i've
   called priests; no one will baptize her. i feel like a fraud. and yet
   i don't want to urge my friend and her lovely daughter away -- maybe
   they'll make better sense of it than i. but they seem to think i'm the
   one to show them. now, finally, my question how did you do it? how do
   you do it? going to church. i mean, did you have any feelings of
   ambiguity about it? so sorry to go on with my questions -- i'll
   understand if you have to give the others a chance. what a greedy
   bitch i am!

<p>How do I do it? I just woke up one Sunday and wondered where the
   nearest Church was. I knew there was one along the street. I tried to
   get in, but the service had already started. I noticed there was
   another church across the street, so I went in there, and I never
   left.

<p>Thing is, I look at other people; people who speak many languages,
   people who can skate good, people who can fix cars like they were
   tying there laces, people who meditate all morning, people who are in
   happy, fulfilled relationships and I wonder; how do you do it?

<p>Church is just for me I suppose. Thing is, you must be in the market
   for a bit of a spiritual leg-up, else you wouldnt be asking these
   questions. Thats how it starts. Ask away, sincerely and with an open
   mind, and you will be given the answer. I do believe that. If you go
   looking, or even ask in prayer, youll find something out. It might be
   very small, but its something to go on.

<p>As for the baptism, I cant understand why nobody will do it! Its sort
   of scandalous! Is that a Catholic thing? Try a methodist or
   presbyterian church. They ought not to turn you and your friend away.
