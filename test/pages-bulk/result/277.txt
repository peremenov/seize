<h>Summing up Disarmament and Conversion Events
<h>Arms Control in Crisis and Disarmament at a Turning Point?

<p>Today indicators for disarmament and conversion signal stagnation or
   even a reversal for the first time in over a decade. It seems that
   disarmament is at a turning point: arms control negotiations are in a
   crisis; efforts at conflict prevention and conflict resolution are a
   mixed bag of successes and failures; and conversion has slowed down.
   Despite this there is still much conversion work ahead, especially in
   reintegrating demobilized armed forces personnel and redundant defense
   industry workers in Eastern Europe as well as in military base
   redevelopment.

<p>This introduction will look at the reasons for the crisis in arms
   control negotiations, will summarize the findings of disarmament and
   conversion trends, will draw attention to ongoing wars and conflict
   resolution efforts as well as to the prevailing trend of opting for a
   military solution to conflicts, and will, finally, draw conclusions,
   identifying possible future ways of revitalizing the disarmament and
   conversion process.

<h>Crisis in arms control negotiations 

<p>A number of failed or stagnating negotiations on weapons of mass
   destruction symbolize the depth of the crisis in international arms
   control. But paradoxically, up to now, the crisis of institutionalized
   (negotiated) arms control has not led to the complete end of
   disarmament. Arms control of the classical type between opposing blocs
   of military alliances has been in crisis since the mid-nineties.
   However, in contrast to negotiated arms control, disarmament can be
   carried out either on the basis of an arms control agreement, or
   unilaterally. Disarmament reduces military forces numerically
   (weapons, military personnel, etc.) and/or military power and renders
   conversion necessary: as long as financial, human and material
   resources are being freed from the military sector, there is also a
   need to convert them in order to avoid unnecessary social or economic
   effects or adverse political reactions.

<p>Despite the highly visible gridlock in arms control negotiations,
   governments have reduced their military forces substantially: weapon
   systems have been decommissioned, troops demobilized, arms production
   capacities reduced, military bases redeveloped for non-military
   purposes, and military expenditures cut. The numerical reduction of
   military forces has actually been happening until recently and is
   continuing in a number of countries and in certain sectors, but the
   year 2000 may prove to be a turning point in numerical, quantitative
   disarmament.

<p>How serious is the decoupling of actual disarmament from
   institutionalized arms control? Will governments continue to disarm
   unilaterally and convert military resources to non-military use as
   they did in the second half of the nineties or will this decoupling
   process put an end to disarmament and conversion? What can arms
   control do to curb the currently prevailing intra-state armed
   conflicts and how effectively can it do this? What priorities are
   necessary to make arms control a facilitator of future disarmament and
   conversion?

<p>Despite the crisis in arms control there have recently been successful
   arms control agreements. Arguably, the most important one was the
   extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in May 1995 and the
   NPT Review Conference in April/May 2000. Unfortunately, this success
   story is called into question by the actual behavior of the nuclear
   weapon states, who have not come to terms on a comprehensive test ban
   or a fissile material ban, let alone complete nuclear disarmamenta
   requirement of the NPT. Another accomplishment was the Ottawa
   Convention banning anti-personnel mines, which took place outside the
   classical forums of arms control. Similar efforts stimulated by the
   landmine convention are now being undertaken to control the
   proliferation and excessive accumulation of small arms and light
   weapons.

<p>Two aspects underlying the crisis of traditional arms control require
   particular attention: the increasing military dominance of the United
   States; and changed perceptions of military threats.

<h>Hegemonic superpower

<p>Many post-Cold War arms control agreements were made possible because
   the Soviet Union, and later Russia, were in a weak position. The
   possible revitalization of Russia was seen in the United States and
   NATO as a realistic option. Reductions in military postures both in
   NATO and in Russia were therefore perceived as mutually beneficial.
   But with the continuing disintegration of the Russian military and the
   obvious loss of Russias status as a military superpower, the US
   interest in strategic stability through bilateral arms control
   diminished; the bilateral superpower relations shifted to a clear and
   growing US dominance. Increasingly, with the Soviet threat gone, the
   United States believes it can control smaller states militarily, even
   if these states aim at nuclear capabilities or other types of weapons
   of mass destruction. The US concept is increasingly focusing on
   limiting the weapon systems of other countries without limiting its
   own room for action as the only global military power. This is most
   clearly illustrated by its plans for a National Missile Defense
   system.

<p>This policy has long-term consequences. The limits of classical arms
   control demonstrate the logic of the well-known security dilemma.
   Wherever a hegemony exists or armaments are asymmetrically
   distributed, arms control is likely to come to a stand-still. The
   haves do not see an incentive to give up their superior position, and
   stimulate arms acquisition among the have-nots just by defending their
   superiority. Nevertheless, unilateral disarmament or regional
   confidence-building can create trust and may instill a sense of
   assurance, spilling over into further rounds of arms control
   (disarmament spill-over). It is still too early to judge whether the
   disarmament of the nineties will prove to be self-sustaining or will
   be reversed, as some indicators tend to suggest.

<h>New military threats: new forms of arms control

<p>Many countries have started to reassess military threats and,
   consequently, the structure of their armed forces. The number of
   long-range military interventions has increased. Multilateral UN
   peace-keeping missions have moved to center stage in the discussion of
   new and future military missions. Regional and internal wars have
   become the focus of attention. This has not only entailed preparation
   for such missions, but also required that the weapons primarily used
   in such wars landmines, small arms and light weapons be placed on the
   international arms control agenda.

<p>Classical arms control, as it developed during the Cold War, has
   proved inadequate for the new situation. Clearly, the central problem
   in wars of today is not the lack of international stability but the
   destructiveness of the weapons and their enormous cost. The most
   prominent example of the emerging reorientation of arms control are
   the negotiations of the landmine convention: the practice of holding
   on to certain types or numbers of weapon systems by such countries as
   the United States, Russia, China and India is typical of classical
   arms control, but to the majority of countries who became party to the
   convention, this was unacceptable. Like-minded states successfully
   negotiated the landmine treaty in a new forum, labeled the Ottawa
   process. Civil society organizationsNGOs became a new actor in arms
   control. The new combination of like-minded governments and a
   diversified network of nationally or internationally operating NGOs
   who made this treaty possible is the only guarantee for compliance.

<p>There is no reason to be overenthusiastic. Many statesmine producers
   as well as mine users, from the United States to Yugoslavia, from
   Russia to Pakistan, from China to Burmaare not party to the
   convention. Even states who are party to the convention have continued
   to plant anti-personnel mines. Non-compliance is not punished. Certain
   types of mines which are dangerous to people are not prohibited.
   Moreover, additional research and development has been stimulated by
   the landmine treaty in order to circumvent its provisions. Whether
   similar treaties are attainable, for example in the area of small arms
   and light weapons, will be demonstrated by the 2001 UN conference on
   the Illegal Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in all its Aspects.
   At the beginning of the new millennium, small arms control has
   enormous scope for improvement. Yet the credibility of both exporting
   as well as importing countries could be improved if the present
   political declarations are underpinned by stricter regulations
   concerning the movements of small arms.

<h>BICC findings: disarmament at a turning point?

<p>Disarmament is easier than arms control. Each government can
   unilaterally decide to disarm and need not wait for arms control
   agreements. This is exactly what many states did during the second
   half of the eighties and particularly during the nineties and is
   confirmed by BICCs measure of disarmament and the potential for
   conversion, the BICC Conversion, Disarmament, Demilitarization and
   Demobilization (BIC3D) Index. This gives a value of 30 for the world
   in 1999, indicating that military sectors had shrunk by 30 percent
   worldwide between the transition phase around the end of the Cold War
   and 1999.

<p>Despite this historically unique reduction in arms, military forces
   are still enormous. Global military expenditures are estimated to have
   amounted to US $686 billion in 1999 (in prices of 1993); the present
   stock of major conventional weapons is still over 422,000 pieces; 21.7
   million military troops still serve in the worlds armed forces; and
   almost 8 million employees work in the arms industry. Thus, almost 30
   million people still earn their living directly and fully in the
   military sector.

<p>Furthermore, high-risk strategies in the field of weapons of mass
   destruction are still applied.

<p>Military expendituresGrowing again: After several years of decline,
   global military expenditures were on the rise again in 1999. This new
   development reverses a trend that has seen a drastic reduction in
   military expenditures and clearly signals a halt, or even a reversal,
   of disarmament and conversion. Although the majority of countries are
   still continuing to reduce their military expenditures, some of the
   bigger spenders such as the United States, France, Germany, China,
   Russia, Brazil and Australia increased or announced the growth of
   their expenditures in 1999/2000.

<p>Military research and development Anti-cyclical trends: Global
   expenditures on military research and development were not as strongly
   affected by the sharp decreases in the early nineties as other parts
   of the budget. While military R&D expenditures in Russia were reduced
   dramatically, those in Western market economies only shrank slightly.
   During the period of reduced defense production in the nineties, the
   development of new weapon technologies and weapon systems was
   prioritized to preserve technological capabilities. R&D seems to have
   done the job of bridging a period of reduced procurement. With the
   reversal in military expenditures described above, R&D efforts are
   slowing down. This could, in turn, mean new demand for conversion at
   military labs.

<p>Industry restructuring and conversion Continued internationalization
   at a higher level of production: After the rapid worldwide decrease in
   military production, there is now indication that the decrease has not
   only slowed down and stopped in recent years but might have already
   been reversed. At least in some of the major arms-producing countries,
   such as the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Russia and
   Japan, production has increased again. Unlike production, however,
   employment in the arms industry has continued to decrease. After a
   number of mega-mergers in previous years, particularly among the large
   arms companies in the United States, attention has now turned to
   international cooperation agreements and acquisitions. However, in the
   military sector, this process of globalization is much less advanced
   than in many other industrial sectors. While conversion and
   diversification of defense production continues in smaller companies
   without much public attention, larger companies tend to concentrate on
   their core defense business activities.

<p>Demobilization and reintegration The need for cooperation with other
   programs: The number of soldiers world-wide has continued to decline
   for the tenth year running, although the process has also slowed down.
   From the peak of 28.8 million in 1987, it was down to 21.7 million in
   1999. While some countries (Russia, Germany) have plans for further
   cuts in their armed forces, demobilization programs are still ongoing
   in others, particularly as a result of post-war rationalization (as in
   Cambodia, East Timor and Sierra Leone). Similar programs will be
   required if peace agreements are reached in other countries. Most
   post-war demobilization programs are conducted simultaneously with, or
   as an integral part of, a more general reform of the security sector
   which includes the democratic control of the armed forces. In recent
   years, actors in development cooperation have recognized the fact that
   they can no longer exclude security issues, but must address them as
   part of a strategy for sustainable development.

<p>Base closure and redevelopment Long-term redevelopment tasks still
   ahead: The restructuring processes of armed forces worldwide have
   greatly reduced the number of military bases. This has been heavily
   concentrated on Europe as well as on a limited number of countries
   elsewhere (Australia, Panama, the Philippines, South Africa, the
   United States and Vietnam). A large array of bases freed by the
   military still need to be redeveloped, and new civil economic usage
   needs to be identified. Furthermore, it can be expected that
   additional rounds of force restructuring, rationalization or
   demilitarization processes will create new tasks for base
   redevelopment (for example in Germany, Northern Ireland, Russia, South
   Africa and the United States).

<p>Surplus weaponsPolitical declarations have to be followed by action
   now: The slowing pace of nuclear disarmament has increased the risk of
   proliferation of all weapons of mass destruction. While the global
   market for new conventional arms shrank after the political changes of
   1989/90, the arms industry has been sustained by an expanded market
   for the upgrading of used weapons. From 1990 onwards, the total number
   of armored vehicles, warships, missiles and military aircraft held by
   all states in the world fell continuously. By 1999, it was almost 30
   percent lower. New initiatives to lessen the impact of contemporary
   wars, such as the campaigns against landmines and small arms, have had
   some success in their own terms. The issue has become high on the
   international policy agenda. Partly in response to the growing
   pressure from civil society, governments are increasingly addressing
   the threats to human security posed by small arms, but, in practice,
   political declarations have not yet been fully implemented.
