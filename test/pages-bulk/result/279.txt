<p>Or was, anyway. America's own little pocket Saddam:

<h>Pain of Past Resurfaces in Guatemala 

<p>SANTA ANITA LAS CANOAS, Guatemala -- Jose Lorenzo Nicho can still
   picture the soldiers tying 14 men to fence posts at dawn. Before they
   drew their rifles and executed them, they tortured the suspected
   guerrillas all night. Nicho, 56, said he remembers hearing their
   screams, including the cries of his two brothers that echoed around
   this mountaintop village and still haunt survivors 21 years later.

<p>That massacre, on Oct. 14, 1982, was one of hundreds committed during
   this country's 36-year civil war, in which more than 200,000 people
   were killed by military or paramilitary forces. The majority of the
   victims were poor Mayan Indians killed in the government's often
   indiscriminate "scorched earth" anti-insurgency campaign in rural
   communities like this one.

<p>Efrain Rios Montt, the former army general who was dictator for 16
   months in 1982-83 at the height of the violence, is now running for
   president, reopening national wounds seven years after U.N.-brokered
   peace accords ended the war.

<p>I've already blogged on the Baathist-like qualities of our Central
   American puppet regimes, here and here. But it never hurts to review,
   particularly now that our conservative and neoconservative brethren
   have become so, um, conveniently passionate about human rights -- in
   Saddam's Iraq, at least.

<p>Of the 200,000 or so victims mentioned in the Post story, perhaps half
   of them can be attributed to Rios Montt, who continued and intensified
   the savage "search and destroy" sweeps through the Guatemalan
   highlands started by his predecessor, Gen. Lucas Garcia.

<p>Granted, those numbers don't quite rank Rios Montt with Saddam in the
   Genocide League's stat tables. But they're still impressive, given
   Guatemala's relatively modest size and population.

<p>The chart below tells the story. It was prepared by the quaintly named
   UN Commission for Historical Clarification, which investigated the
   Guatemalan killing fields in the early 1990s:

<p>It shows the total documented cases of crimes such as arbitrary
   execution, torture and "disappearance" committed in Guatemala each
   year. The chart is on a log scale (1, 10, 100, 1000, etc.) So, if
   anything, it understates the fury of the genocidal wave of terror
   unleashed during the peak years of the early 1980s.

<p>Back then, it was popular in conservative circles to blame leftist
   guerrillas (or in Al Haig's case, a "sinister third force") for many
   Central American atrocities. So the UN Commission also looked into the
   issue of responsibility in Guatemala. And here's what it found:

<p>But numbers and charts can't really capture the full savagery of the
   nightmare that Rios Montt and his fellow generals unleashed on their
   own people. Here's a small sample of what the UN Commission uncovered:

<p>In the majority of massacres there is evidence of multiple acts of
   savagery, which preceded, accompanied or occurred after the deaths of
   the victims. Acts such as the killing of defenceless children, often
   by beating them against walls or throwing them alive into pits where
   the corpses of adults were later thrown; he amputation of limbs; the
   impaling of victims; the killing of persons by covering them in petrol
   and burning them alive; the extraction, in the presence of others, of
   the viscera of victims who were still alive; the confinement of people
   who had been mortally tortured, in agony for days; the opening of the
   wombs of pregnant women, and other similarly atrocious acts, were not
   only actions of extreme cruelty against the victims, but also morally
   degraded the perpetrators and those who inspired, ordered or tolerated
   these actions. 

<p>You gotta think Saddam would be at least a little impressed by that
   kind of attention to detail.

<p>What did the U.S. State Department's Human Rights Desk (then occupied
   by Iran-Contra criminal Elliot Abrams) have say at the time about
   conditions in Guatemala?

<p>Praising the . . . government's "increased sensitivity to human rights
   questions," the administration's annual review of Guatemala's human
   rights record in 1984 concedes that "sporadic abuse still does occur
   at the local command level." 

<p>Abrams, of course, would go on to occupy first a federal courtroom
   (giving false and misleading testimony to Congress), then the human
   rights desk at the Bush II National Security Council, and then the
   NSC's Middle East desk.

<p>And what does Gen. Rios Montt have to say about his past?

<p>Do you want me to start crying or get gastritis about it? I am not [a
   devil]. If I were, I wouldn't be here." He said that even if military
   atrocities occurred, he would not necessarily have known about them.
   "I was president, not a platoon commander," he said.

<p>Obviously, delegation is the secret to Rios Mont's management success.
   That, plus having a daughter who is a vice president of Congress, a
   son who is one of the country's top military leaders and a brother who
   is a Roman Catholic bishop. Clearly, Saddam isn't the only Third World
   dictator with a strong set of family values.

<p>But Rios Montt's comeback campaign still faces a few hurdles. One is a
   pesky amendment to the Guatemalan constitution that bans coup plotters
   (strike one) and dictators (strike two) from running for president.

<p>Of course, with the help of family and friends, such barriers can be
   overcome. A more serious obstacle could be the Bush Administration,
   which has no desire to see old Central American dictators -- not to
   mention memories of old Iran-Contra conspiracy charges -- dredged up
   again.

<p>But you have to suspect that if Rios Montt does manage to worm his way
   back into power, the Bushies will learn to live with it. The general,
   after all, is a fire-breathing evangelical Protestant (albeit washed
   in the blood of something other than the lamb.) This means he can
   probably count on the support of various politically well-connected
   conservative churches here in the United States, who are eager to wean
   Guatamala away from its traditional Catholicism.

<p>According to Human Rights Watch, the Bush administration already is
   showing a certain flexibility when it comes to Guatemalan abuses:

<p>In October 2000, the (Clinton Administration's) United States Trade
   Representative took the unprecedented step of initiating a review of
   Guatemala's status as a beneficiary of the U.S. Generalized System of
   Preferences (GSP) largely in response to the failure of government
   authorities to adequately punish anti-union violence. A review
   examines a country's compliance with certain
   internationally-recognized workers' rights to determine its
   eligibility for GSP tariff benefits. 

<p>In May 2001, the Bush administration's new USTR lifted the review of
   Guatemala's beneficiary status . . .

<p>So it appears that in Guatemala, at least, even aging genocidal
   dictators can enjoy a second taste of power.

<p>Now maybe if Saddam converted to Christianity . . .

<p>Rios Montt could be a Republican Texan for all he cares about anyone
   other than the rich. His WMD, War on Mayan Defenseless, couldn't have
   happened without the tacit support of American corporations and overt
   support of the US government. Much of the region has been "occupied"
   for the benefit of US interests for decades according to the accounts
   of Gen. Smedley Butler. Rios Montt was merely the most recent attempt
   that almost succeeded. The fact that he's "running" for president
   merely indicates to me that the pogrom against the Mayan tribes is
   intended to resume.

<p>Will there be an attempt by a member of the Somoza family to regain
   power in Nicaragua? Certainly someone like him is already campaigning
   in Washington for such support. After all, there are still living
   Sandinistas down there, which threatens the profitability, er, I mean,
   uh, freedom of the region!

<p>Can there also be an attempt afoot to retake the Panama Canal, whose
   value in today's world is sorely limited to smaller and less
   profitable shiploads? Why not? It's OURS! We built it after we stole
   Panama fair and square from Columbia after promising them that we
   would honor Columbia's interests in their distaff state.

<p>And just how long would it then take to locate Our Bastard in
   Venezuela, or Columbia, or even Peru?

<p>We'll show those ingrates not to throw Bechtel out of Bolivia and not
   reimburse them for their expenses in "buying" up the water
   distribution and jacking up the price of water beyond affordability!

<p>And once we're done conquering, er, being welcomed into every Central
   and South American country by rose-tossing, cheering crowds, we will
   REALLY feel the love we are due! They owe us!

<p>The multi-billion dollar history of the now defunct Bank of Credit and
   Commerce International (BCCI) is worth a read. It's a small window
   into the way butchers and bankers (both American and foreign)
   contributed to the horrors in Central and South America. The same
   names (Kissinger, Zia, etc)and institutions (Citibank, Credit Swisse,
   etc)keep comming up over and over again. The 'front' organisations may
   change but the pullers of levers and triggers don't.

<p>There should be more stories like this about all the brutal dictators
   the US supported in the past. How about a "brutality index" list of
   dictators around the world, US-supported and
   US-ignored-because-they-don't-sit-on-oil?

<p>Especially now that the current Repug line is "it doesn't matter if we
   find WMD's or not because Saddam was really brutal, we had to do
   something!"

<p>I second shystee. How about it, Billmon? Care to risk that lightning
   might strike the Whiskey Bar a second time this month? The
   plagiarizing press will claim they know!

<p>Drinks are on me if they don't!

<p>Actually, somebody already has done something sorta like that.
