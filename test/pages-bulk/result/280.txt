<h>A simple approach for protein name identification: prospects and
   limits

<h>Background

<p>Significant parts of biological knowledge are available only as
   unstructured text in articles of biomedical journals. By automatically
   identifying gene and gene product (protein) names and mapping these to
   unique database identifiers, it becomes possible to extract and
   integrate information from articles and various data sources.

<p>We present a simple and efficient approach that identifies gene and
   protein names in texts and returns database identifiers for matches.
   It has been evaluated in the recent BioCreAtIvE entity extraction and
   mention normalization task by an independent jury.

<h>Methods

<p>Our approach is based on the use of synonym lists that map the unique
   database identifiers for each gene/protein to the different synonym
   names. For yeast and mouse, synonym lists were used as provided by the
   organizers who generated them from public model organism databases.
   The synonym list for fly was generated directly from the corresponding
   organism database. The lists were then extensively curated in largely
   automated procedure and matched against MEDLINE abstracts by exact
   text matching. Rule-based and support vector machine-based post
   filters were designed and applied to improve precision.

<h>Results

<p>Our procedure showed high recall and precision with F-measures of
   0.897 for yeast and 0.764/0.773 for mouse in the BioCreAtIvE
   assessment (Task 1B) and 0.768 for fly in a post-evaluation.

<h>Conclusion

<p>The results were close to the best over all submissions. Depending on
   the synonym properties it can be crucial to consider context and to
   filter out erroneous matches. This is especially important for fly,
   which has a very challenging nomenclature for the protein name
   identification task. Here, the support vector machine-based post
   filter proved to be very effective.

<h>Backgroung   
   
<p>Protein name identification in texts is an important challenge in
   bioinformatics. Several approaches have been proposed to tackle this
   problem. Machine learning and statistical techniques proved to be
   useful [1-4]. Other methods focus on linguistic techniques [5], or are
   based on the usage of dictionaries extracted from databases,
   ontologies, and other data sources [6-8]. Some methods rely on the
   combination of dictionaries and linguistic/machine learning techniques
   [9]. An overview of biological named entity extraction and an
   introduction into the problem with description of fly synonyms is
   given in [10].

<p>Yeast, mouse, and fly are interesting organisms from several points of
   view: they are among the experimentally most intensively studied
   organisms. As model organisms they are frequently used to elucidate
   pathways and molecular interactions that might play a role in human
   diseases. For each of these organisms, there exists a well curated and
   public organism specific database. As many scientific publications
   deal with these organisms, a reliable gene/protein name detection
   method would be a significant advance for information retrieval and
   extraction. Due to the differences in their protein nomenclature, the
   set of these three organisms is well suited for comparing gene/protein
   name identification tools.

<p>When an entity extraction system is required to provide database
   identifiers for identified proteins, it is certainly beneficial to use
   a dictionary-based approach. We present a simple and efficient
   approach for protein name identification. It is based on extensively
   curated synonym lists. Synonyms are then searched within MEDLINE
   abstracts by exact matching. The matching tool only recognizes
   spellings of a synonym that are explicitly contained in the synonym
   list and it does not consider context for matching. Its initial main
   application was to test different synonym lists and to evaluate
   different kinds of expansions of synonym lists performed during
   curation. This tool allows us to rapidly evaluate modifications of
   synonyms and enables us to build high-quality synonym lists. These can
   then also be used as a prerequisite for text-mining with other
   text-mining tools. Additionally, we present post filters which improve
   precision of our results; this is important for synonyms that overlap
   with common words or expressions having different meanings.

<p>The BioCreAtIvE evaluation (task 1B) [11] was set up to assess the
   ability of automated systems to identify names of genes and gene
   products and normalize them by association of a unique identifier for
   each gene/gene product. In this paper we use the terms gene, gene
   product and protein as synonyms even though these terms refer to
   distinct biological objects.

<p>Our goal in participating in the BioCreAtIvE evaluation was to assess
   the recall and precision that can be achieved with extensively curated
   synonym lists and exact string-matching, and to assess the difference
   with more sophisticated text-mining approaches. This evaluation allows
   us to evaluate our approach, especially the quality of annotation, on
   a blind prediction basis and for an independent test set. By using
   comparable synonym lists, it also allows us to compare our approach to
   a more involved approximate matching procedure implemented in the tool
   ProMiner [6,12] in terms of recall and precision, as well as runtime
   and ease of use.

<h>Generation and curation of synonym lists

<p>The performance of an approach based on exact matching depends heavily
   on the quality and completeness of the synonym list used for
   searching. The synonym lists for yeast and mouse were created on the
   basis of the lists provided by the BioCreAtIvE organizers. These lists
   were originally extracted from the corresponding organism specific
   databases, Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) [13] and Mouse Genome
   Database (MGD) [14]. The fly synonym list was extracted directly from
   FlyBase [15] and provided by Hanisch et al. [12].

<p>We curated the provided lists to cover additional, frequently used
   synonyms and remove unspecific and inappropriate synonyms. The
   individual curation steps are fully automated, they can be applied
   individually and thus the curation procedure can be adapted to the
   synonym list that needs to be curated. Essentially we always follow
   the same curation procedure, usually only very few parameters or rules
   are changed when it is applied to a synonym list of a different
   organism. Here we describe the principles and the sequential steps as
   applied for the mouse synonym list; for yeast and fly the procedure
   was slightly modified.

<p>In a first step, synonyms consisting solely of digits and/or special
   characters and synonyms of length less than two are removed. Subtype
   specifiers are expanded to equivalent other specifiers (a<=>alpha).
   Special characters at the beginning or end of a synonym are removed
   and different spelling variants like the insertion of a hyphen or
   space between alphabetic characters and digits are added (Igf
   1<=>Igf-1<=>Igf1). Synonyms of a length less than six characters are
   added in upper case and with the first character in upper case.

<p>Eventually, organism specific expansion is performed, e.g. yeast
   synonyms as defined in the synonym list are often mentioned in texts
   with extension 'p', e.g. SOH6 -> SOH6p. The rules for such organism
   specific expansions must be deduced from a given training set (as it
   was the case here) or by manual analysis of a set of texts if no
   annotated training set is available.

<p>In a second step, synonyms matching common English words are removed
   (this step is not done for fly, which has many valid protein names
   that are common English words). Synonyms containing subtype specifiers
   are expanded by the synonym without subtype specifier if there is only
   one subtype mentioned in the synonym list (aminoacylase 1 ->
   aminoacylase).

<p>The third step accomplishes further expansion and pruning. The tool
   used for this purpose was provided by D. Hanisch, for a detailed
   description see [6]. In the expansion phase, new synonyms are added to
   the existing ones. The expansion is based on rules and lists. A list
   of frequent acronyms and long names is used for expanding every
   occurrence of a common acronym in the synonym list to the
   corresponding long name and reducing long names to acronyms
   (IL<=>interleukin).

<p>Inappropriate synonyms are detected and removed in the pruning phase
   by using token-class based regular expressions. A token can be any
   sequence of letters and/or numbers. A token class is a group of words
   which have a similar meaning or usage. Examples of token classes are:
   measuring units (contains: kDa, Da, mg,...), common words (if, and,
   as, for, ...), descriptions (tRNA, Ser, Tyr,...), numbers, single
   letters. These token classes are combined in regular expressions, e.g.
   'a number followed by a measuring unit', 'one description', 'a common
   word followed by a number'. Synonyms that are matched exactly by one
   of these regular expressions are removed, e.g. '22 kDa' is removed by
   the regular expression 'a number followed by a measuring unit'; 'If 1'
   is removed by the pattern 'a common word followed by a number'. The
   lists of words belonging to a token class and the rules for combining
   them in regular expressions were compiled during previous work (based
   on analysis of synonyms provided in Swiss-Prot [16] and HUGO [17] and
   their matching statistics against MEDLINE abstracts). The lists and
   rules used during the third curation step are of a general character
   and hence are usually not adapted when applied to new synonym lists.
   Ambiguous synonyms (i.e. synonyms belonging to more than one protein)
   generally need to be assigned or disambiguated to one of the
   corresponding proteins. Our approach does no disambiguation, therefore
   ambiguous synonyms are removed from the synonym list. Objects which
   have no synonym left are removed from the synonym list.

<p>The standard curation procedure was adapted to BioCreAtIvE as follows:
   For yeast, the expansion rule for the extension 'p' was added. For
   fly, common words were not removed. For all organisms, synonyms that
   produced many false positive but not true positive matches in the
   training data were removed. The results on the provided hand-curated
   training set were analysed manually and some obvious, but missing
   synonyms were added (about 15 synonyms).

<p>Due to the added spelling variants and expansion of abbreviations the
   curated synonym lists are significantly larger than the original ones.
   The curated mouse synonym list contains on average 7.6 synonyms per
   object compared to 2.5 synonyms per object in the original list. The
   curated yeast synonym list contains on average 5.2 synonyms per object
   compared to 1.9 synonyms per object in the original list. The run-time
   of the entire curation procedure depends on the size of the synonym
   list and the rules that are applied; it is about 2 minutes for the
   yeast synonym list.

<h>Match detection

<p>Synonyms as defined in the synonym list are searched within the texts
   by exact text matching. The search is case insensitive only if the
   synonym contains numbers or if the synonym length is above a certain
   threshold (5 characters). When several synonyms of different length
   can be matched at a certain text position, only the longest match is
   reported.

<h>Rule-based post filter

<p>We implemented a simple rule-based post filter that checks occurrences
   of synonyms for nearby occurrence of modifiers (e.g. 'cells',
   'domains', 'cell type', 'DNA binding site') indicating that the
   passage of text does not refer to a protein.

<p>Short synonyms in parentheses often overlap with definitions of
   abbreviations differing from the assumed protein, e.g. '...mapped by
   fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)...', '...developing mouse
   submandibular gland (SMG)...', 'Fish' and 'SMG' are valid mouse
   protein names, but the text does not refer to these as proteins. We
   clarify the meaning of such occurrences by checking the words ahead of
   parentheses corresponding to the letters of the synonym. If no
   significant overlap of these words with the alternative names of the
   assumed protein is found the match is discarded. As example the
   alternative name for 'Fish' is 'five SH3 domains', for 'SMG' it is
   'small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide G', both have no overlap
   with the text fragments before parentheses shown above and are
   therefore removed.

<h>SVM-based post filter

<p>Fly synonyms show a significant overlap with common English words,
   body parts and phenotypic descriptions and therefore require context
   dependent evaluation. After the BioCreAtIvE assessment, a post filter
   based on support vector machines (SVM) [18] has been implemented.

<p>First, the curated fly synonym list is searched against
   MEDLINE-abstracts. Matches of multi-word synonyms are always accepted.
   Matches of single-word synonyms are evaluated by the SVM and
   classified as true or false hits. The SVM uses the following features:

<l>surface keys, i.e. orthographic properties of the matched synonym:
   synonym length; whether it contains non-characters, numbers, greek
   numbers, capitals, lower-case letters, numbers and letters; whether it
   consists entirely of capitals, lower-case letters; whether it has a
   capital after a non-capital; whether the first letter is upper case
   followed by only lower case

<l>part of speech tags [19] of the matched synonym and directly
   adjacent words

<l>prefix and suffix of the synonym (the first and last 2 and 3
   letters)

<l>all substrings of length 3 of the synonym

<p>The feature value for the synonym length corresponds to the number of
   characters of the synonym. All other features are encoded as binary
   values (e.g. one feature is defined for each possible substring of
   length 3 and the corresponding feature value is set 1 for all
   substrings that appear in the considered synonym, all other substring
   feature values are set 0).

<p>Furthermore, we use scores that indicate how often a word was found
   close to a correct synonym match. Six categories of words were used:
   nearest verbs, nearest nouns, and words adjacent to a synonym match;
   occurrences before and after a match were considered separately.

<p>Scores for nouns and verbs were generated from the 5,000 abstracts of
   the fly training set. We analysed each sentence that contains a
   synonym and extracted the closest verb and noun [19] before and after
   the synonym match. As positive samples, we used the correct matches,
   as negative samples the false matches (false positives). For these
   verbs and nouns a score is calculated as described below.

<p>A second set of scores is based on a search of mouse synonyms against
   approximately 700,000 MEDLINE abstracts. In this data set, words
   appearing adjacent to synonym matches are extracted irrespective of
   their grammatical class. Since we have no standard of truth for this
   data set, we assume every match as positive sample and extract the
   words adjacent to it. In order to estimate the background frequency of
   words, we consider all words of every sentence of that data set where
   no synonym has been matched as negative.
   
<p>These scores are then used as SVM feature values: The directly
   adjacent words and the closest verbs and nouns before and after a
   synonym match are extracted. For each category, the score of the word
   is used as value for the corresponding feature, it is 0 if no score
   was defined for the word.

<p>The SVM uses a linear kernel. It is trained on 10,000 exact matches of
   single-word synonyms against the fly training set, where each true hit
   is used as positive sample and each false hit as negative sample. For
   the prediction, the curated synonym list is matched against the
   abstracts of the test set. Matches of multi-word synonyms are accepted
   directly. Every match of a single-word synonym is classified by the
   SVM as positive or negative. A single word synonym is only accepted
   for an abstract if at least one match of this synonym within the
   abstract is classified as positive. All matches of multi-word synonyms
   and the accepted single-word synonyms are reported as final result.

<p>In this paper we only show the usability of the SVM-based post filter
   for fly synonyms. The motivation for using scores obtained by
   searching fly and mouse synonyms against two different sets of
   abstracts was to exploit more information than given in the annotated
   training data.

<h>Principles of the ProMiner approach

<p>The ProMiner team used essentially the same curated mouse synonym list
   as we did. Thus BioCreAtIvE allows a comparison of our exact matching
   approach to the ProMiner approach, which is described in detail in
   [6,12]. Here we only give a short description of the ProMiner
   principles.

<p>The match algorithm implemented in ProMiner is based on token classes.
   Different token classes have different weights according to their
   relevance for the protein name, e.g. tokens of the class 'Modifier'
   (class contains tokens like: inhibitor, ligand, antagonist,...) are
   important and thus have a high weight whereas tokens of the token
   class 'Description' (contains: chain, component, product,...) have a
   low weight. This weighting scheme allows that a multi-word synonym is
   recognized even if certain less relevant parts of it are missing in
   the text. The ProMiner framework additionally applies different post
   filters and thus filters out non-specific synonyms. It has
   disambiguation capability, i.e. depending on the context of a synonym
   match it can narrow the list of proteins that an ambiguous synonym
   refers to. The tolerance of matching, the stringency of post filters,
   and also the accepted level of ambiguity for reporting is defined by a
   set of parameters that can be tuned for a specific application.

<h>Evaluation

<p>The Evaluation was performed on 250 MEDLINE abstracts for each of the
   organisms yeast, mouse, and fly. The results were evaluated by the
   BioCreAtIvE organizers in terms of:

<h>Table 1
<p>Results in BioCreAtIvE Task 1B: Our results compared to results with
   highest overall F-measure. For mouse and fly the highest F-measure is
   achieved by ProMiner. Our yeast result was obtained by exact matching
   of the curated list, no post filter was applied. Mouse(1) is the exact
   search with the curated list. Mouse(2) was additionally filtered with
   the rule-based post filter. Our fly results were obtained as
   post-evaluation by exact matching of the curated list and application
   of the SVM-based post filter.

   marked in italics. The synonyms and matches are correct but the

   BioCreAtIvE task 1B.

   meanings, and the effect of the rule-based post filter on these

<h>Table 4
<p>Samples of false negative matches: closest synonyms in synonym list,
   occurrence in text, and type of error.

<h>General performance

<p>For yeast, we submitted one result set without post-filtering. For
   mouse, we submitted two runs: one without any post-filtering (run 1)
   and one with the rule-based post filter described above (run 2). For
   both organisms our tool achieved results close to the best overall
   results. The results are shown in table 1 and figures 1 and 2. The
   results for fly (obtained as post-evaluation) are shown in figure 3.

<p>For yeast the difference in F-measure from the best result is 2.4%.
   This difference is mainly due to lower precision (3.3%), but also
   recall is somewhat lower (1.6%). For mouse, the best result is a run
   done with ProMiner; the difference with our results in F-measure is
   2.6%/1.7%. This run was done with the same synonym list, the only
   difference being that the list for ProMiner contained ambiguous
   synonyms, which were removed from our list.

<p>Some examples of errors in the recognition of mouse gene names are
   listed in the tables 2, 3, and 4. The errors in the yeast results are
   similar, and are not discussed in detail.

<p>BioCreAtIvE shows the different levels of difficulty for protein name
   recognition for different organisms; yeast has a quite precise
   nomenclature consisting mainly of distinctive single word synonyms,
   compared to mouse with many multi word protein names, and fly for
   which a large number of synonyms exist that overlap with standard
   English words and anatomic descriptions.

<p>Our results show that a straightforward approach for protein name
   recognition can be successful. Exact matching of curated synonyms
   results in good recall and precision for yeast and mouse, the results
   are only marginally below those of the best methods available.

<p>Curation and exact matching of fly synonyms results in low precision
   (figure 3). This pinpoints a limit of the 'simple' approach. The
   results after application of the SVM-based post filter show that this
   limit can be overcome by additional application of more involved
   techniques.

<h>Curation of synonym list

<p>Figures 1, 2, and 3 show the impact of curation. The result obtained
   with the original, non-curated, and the final, fully curated, synonym
   list is shown for all three organisms. The results of the fully
   curated lists of yeast and mouse were those that were submitted to
   BioCreAtIvE.

<p>The curation of the yeast synonym list increases recall significantly
   while precision decreases slightly (Figure 1).

<p>For mouse, figure 2 shows the results for the original and the fully
   curated list and also results for intermediate curation steps. The
   figure shows that already an exact search with a list returned from
   steps 1+2 of our curation procedure yields results which are
   comparable to those submitted by other groups. The final results were
   generated by applying all three curation steps. The additional
   execution of the third step of curation, namely the removal of
   inappropriate synonyms based on regular expressions of tokens and the
   expansion of acronyms and long names yields a further increase in
   recall and precision. The complete curation procedure significantly
   increases precision and also slightly improves recall of the mouse
   synonym list.

<p>During the curation procedure, all ambiguous synonyms were removed. We
   analyzed two scenarios for estimating the effect of not removing them
   from the mouse synonym list. If we kept all ambiguous synonyms and
   reported all proteins to which they belong, we would obtain 24
   additional correct matches and 133 false matches (recall: 84.0%,
   precision: 61.2%, F: 70.8%). If we were able to disambiguate them to
   the correct objects, which would be the ideal case, this would have
   been 24 additional correct matches and no additional false matches
   (recall: 84.0%, precision: 74.6%, F: 79.0%).

<p>Figure 3 shows the effect of curation on fly. Precision is
   significantly increased by curation and recall slightly decreased. The
   F-measure obtained with the fully curated list is still low (43.1%),
   which is due to the low precision (29.1%) of matches of synonyms
   resembling common words and descriptions, a problem that is addressed
   and largely eliminated by the SVM-based post filter.

<h>False positives

<p>All false positive matches are correct matches of a valid synonym,
   they appear as false positives because the occurrence does not refer
   to the protein that was assumed to be mentioned. In these cases, the
   context reveals the intended meaning of the expression.

<p>The false positive matches can be classified in different categories.
   Some examples are listed in tables 2 and 3. Several false positives
   originate from phenotypic descriptions, e.g. 'growth retarded'.
   Detailed grammar or semantic analysis would be required to distinguish
   between such descriptions and the gene being associated with the
   phenotype. Other false positive matches have keywords close-by that
   clearly indicate that the match should not be reported because it
   refers to a different organism or it is not the focus of interest,
   e.g. 'human doublecortin' or 'BMP2-mediated'. These matches could
   easily be filtered out by the rule-based post filter, which does not
   yet consider organisms and words indicating that a match is only a
   passing mention. The post filter removes several false positive
   matches and so slightly increases precision, some examples are given
   in table 3.

<h>False negatives

<p>The false negative matches can be classified into three groups (see
   table 4 for some examples): missing synonyms, different spellings of
   synonyms, and ambiguous synonyms.

<p>In the future, recall could be increased by covering more spelling
   variants. Some of the false negatives can be recovered by quite simple
   means such as equal treatment of space and hyphen or a further
   extension of subtype descriptors (e.g. alpha, a, I, 1). Inversions are
   more difficult to deal with as they are not always allowed. The
   inclusion of ambiguous synonyms could also bring about an improvement.

<p>In some cases proteins are mentioned by expressions which have no
   clear relation to any of the given synonyms. These cases are difficult
   to handle.

<p>The analysis of the false negative matches of yeast showed that long
   names of some proteins were used in abstracts while our synonym list
   contained only the corresponding short names. Some of these long names
   could have been extracted from description fields of the Saccharomyces
   Genome Database or Swiss-Prot. We only used the original synonym lists
   and applied the curation procedure as described above for obtaining
   the final synonym list. We did not include further information as
   contained in the database description fields or the list of additional
   yeast gene descriptions provided by the organizers. The reason for
   this is that we wanted to evaluate our approach in a way so that it
   could be applied for a large set of organisms, which possibly are not
   as well annotated with additional description fields as yeast, mouse
   and fly. It is certain that by considering further data sources as the
   annotations and descriptions in organism specific databases or general
   databases like Swiss-Prot, it will be possible to discover further
   synonyms and thus obtain higher recall.

<h>Rule-based post filter

<p>The rule-based post filter was applied on mouse results; it increases
   precision by 2.9% and decreases recall by 1.5%. This shows that the
   approach is in principle useful but also shows its limits. The rules
   applied for filtering out false positives were defined after a crude
   manual analysis of the results on the training set. Further
   enhancement is clearly possible.

<p>One of the aims of the BioCreAtIvE evaluation is the organism-specific
   recognition of gene/protein names. Our approach does not yet include
   an organism filter. Precision might be increased by disapproving
   matches that co-occur with organism names distinct from the organism
   of interest.

<p>The examples of false positive matches in table 2 suggest further
   rules: All matches with a close-by occurrence of words indicating a
   passing mention (like '...-mediated','...-activated',...) could be
   removed; Part of speech tagging could help to identify descriptions
   like 'striated muscle', and one could consider removing matches that
   are tagged as adjective.

<p>A more detailed analysis of false positive matches would probably
   produce further rules, but this needs intensive manual effort. Another
   possibility could be the generation of rules by automatic means, e.g.
   statistic analysis of word frequencies. We propose the usage of the
   SVM-based post filter instead of the rule-based post filter, as it
   also considers close-by words but does not need manually generated
   rules.

<h>SVM-based post filter

<p>The identification of fly synonyms highlights the limits of the simple
   approach consisting of extensive curation and exact matching of a
   synonym list. The nomenclature of fly makes it indispensible to filter
   matches depending on the context. We used a SVM to filter hits
   resulting from exact matching.

<p>As descriptors, we use a number of commonly used features, such as
   surface keys, part-of-speech tags, and substrings. Furthermore, we
   exploit the capability of our system to recognise mouse synonyms with
   satisfying accuracy and speed. We estimate scores for words appearing
   close to synonym matches within a large set of MEDLINE abstracts.
   These scores indicate the frequency of occurrence of the word with
   synonym matches. Some examples of the top-ranked words are:
   interactor, protooncogene, costimulates (category 'word directly after
   synonym match'); heterodimer, transcripts, corepressor (category 'noun
   after match'); exerts, suppresses, encodes (category 'verb after
   match'). These words are strong indicators of a gene-/protein-mention.

<p>Thus, we include more information than given in the original training
   set. The SVM-based post filter proves to be very effective in
   filtering matches of fly synonyms, it increases precision by 51.1% and
   F-measure by 33.7% compared to the exact matching of the curated
   synonym list without post-filtering. The analysis of the filtered
   matches of the evaluation data set showed that most synonyms were
   either never (e.g. modulo, rough, snake, forked) or always (e.g. to,
   for, key, gel, lines) filtered, and that this is almost always correct
   according to the annotation of the organizers. In some cases context
   is crucial for correctly classifying results, e.g. the word 'torpedo'
   in '... the signals transduced by the torpedo product ...' describes a
   fly gene, whereas in '... the mature Drosophila AChE is closely
   homologous to that of Torpedo AChE.' it describes an organism. These
   mentions were correctly classified by the SVM-based post filter. The
   filter also has a positive effect on the matches of yeast and mouse
   synonyms (results not shown). A significant advantage of this
   filtering approach compared to the rule-based post filter is its
   independence of manually generated rules and its general
   applicability.

<h>Comparison to approximate matching implemented in ProMiner

<p>Our results show that especially for organisms having a stringent
   terminology, such as yeast, exact text matching is useful and
   reasonable for protein name recognition. For such organisms, an
   approximate search like the algorithm applied in ProMiner does not
   improve the results significantly. The results for mouse show that for
   organisms with a more difficult terminology there is a slight
   difference in performance between exact text matching and approximate
   search. Considering the best submitted results of both approaches
   (those yielding highest F-measure), precision is similar but recall is
   higher for approximate search. Keeping in mind the approximate
   matching procedure of ProMiner, this is obvious.

<p>The result of the basic ProMiner search with the non-curated synonym
   list and no filtering and disambiguation (Figure 2, PM search, orig.
   syn. list) is slightly better than the results of exact matching of
   the non-curated synonym list. This is due to approximate matching and
   the internal scoring function that eliminates poor matches. The full
   ProMiner framework includes extensive filtering and disambiguation.
   With optimal parameter setting this system shows good results even
   when using the non-curated synonym list (F-measure 0.78, PM framework,
   orig. syn. list). The parameters used for this run were acquired
   during post evaluation and turned out to yield better results than the
   parameters used for the BioCreAtIvE submissions. By using the curated
   synonym list with the same settings (PM framework, cur. syn. list) the
   F-measure increases further to 0.80. This shows that also for an
   approximate and advanced approach like ProMiner the curation of the
   synonym list has a significant effect on the search result. There are
   important advantages of the exact matching procedure: It is easy to
   run as it does not need any parameter optimisation. As the curation of
   the synonym list is independent of the search, an iterative curation
   procedure can be established. This is useful if the search result on a
   training set indicates bad synonyms which should be removed from the
   synonym list. The runtime of the curation procedure depends largely on
   the size and characteristics of the synonym list. For yeast, the
   curation takes about 2 minutes and the exact search against the
   training set of 5,000 abstracts including analysis and report of
   results takes about 45 seconds on a standard machine. The exact search
   script is implemented in Perl, it has less than 750 lines of code and
   is easy to adapt to different input and output formats.

<p>ProMiner is less dependent on the curation of the synonym list and is
   capable of synonym disambiguation, but it is more difficult to set up
   and handle. The system needs adjustment of different matching
   parameters which have a significant effect on the results. It needs
   about 1.5 minutes for preprocessing (i.e. tokenization of synonyms,
   analysis for token classes and organisation in a search structure) of
   the yeast synonym list. The search on the corresponding training set
   including filtering and report of results takes 3.5 minutes.

<p>Our goal in participating in the BioCreAtIvE evaluation was to assess
   the recall and precision that can be achieved with extensively curated
   synonym lists and exact string-matching, and to assess the difference
   with more sophisticated text-mining approaches. Our mouse synonym list
   was also used by group 16 with a more sophisticated search algorithm
   implemented in the tool ProMiner [6,12]. This evaluation allowed us to
   compare the different approaches on a blind prediction basis and for
   an independent test set. The results show that the difference in terms
   of recall and precision is small. Our approach showed good performance
   in protein name recognition with exact text matching. Our system does
   not need to be adapted for specific synonym lists in terms of
   parameter tuning or internal lists. This allows for straightforward
   application. It is crucial for our approach to use synonym lists which
   are as complete and correct as possible. Therefore, we used a system
   for the extensive curation of protein synonym lists, based on the
   application of individual, fully automated steps. This curation is
   largely independent of the synonym list to be curated since the
   individual curation steps are of general character. Nevertheless, the
   system can easily be adapted to cover specific problems of synonym
   lists, like missing synonyms that are frequently used in texts and
   which can be deduced from the synonyms in the list by application of
   rules.

<p>One disadvantage of the extensive curation is the fact that the
   synonym lists become very large as they need to cover all possible
   different spellings of a protein name. In order to avoid this, one
   could consider making the text search more flexible, e.g. by including
   certain equivalent expressions like space and hyphen directly in the
   search tool.

<p>Our approach relies heavily on synonym lists and is therefore
   presumably less useful for applications where such a list is not
   readily available, e.g. the recognition of general gene and protein
   names without normalization as in BioCreAtIvE task 1A (in which we did
   not participate). One could consider generating a general synonym list
   by joining annotations from a large number of public databases for
   applying our approach to this task.

<p>BioCreAtIvE clearly demonstrated the different levels of difficulty
   for identifying gene names of different organisms. For yeast, we
   obtained good results without any post-filtering, mouse results were
   slightly inferior, and fly results without post-filtering are
   unsatisfactory because of low precision. The usage of post filters can
   compensate for low precision, especially the proposed SVM-based post
   filter proved to be very effective.

<p>Exact matching of the curated synonym list returns hits with high
   recall. Depending on the characteristics of the synonym list, an
   appropriate post filter can be set up individually for increasing
   precision. The fly results show that also for organisms with an
   unspecific nomenclature, our approach including post-filtering yields
   good results.

<p>The separation between matching and filtering allows flexibility in
   the kind of filter applied, and also makes it possible to gear the
   final result towards recall or precision.
