<h>Database

<p>A suite of web applications to streamline the interdisciplinary
   collaboration in secondary data analyses

<h>Background

<p>We describe a system of web applications designed to streamline the
   interdisciplinary collaboration in outcomes research.

<h>Description

<p>The outcomes research process can be described as a set of three
   interrelated phases: design and selection of data sources, analysis,
   and output. Each of these phases has inherent challenges that can be
   addressed by a group of five web applications developed by our group.
   QuestForm allows for the formulation of relevant and well-structured
   outcomes research questions; Research Manager facilitates the project
   management and electronic file exchange among researchers; Analysis
   Charts facilitate the communication of complex statistical techniques
   to clinicians with varying previous levels of statistical knowledge;
   Literature Matrices improve the efficiency of literature reviews. An
   outcomes research question is used to illustrate the use of the
   system.

<h>Conclusions

<p>The system presents an alternative to streamline the interdisciplinary
   collaboration of clinicians, statisticians, programmers, and graduate
   students.

<p>In the last decade, the number of relevant data sources available for
   outcomes research has grown exponentially. In contrast, the number of
   individual researchers with clinical and statistical expertise
   required to explore these data sets increase at a much slower pace. As
   a result, an immense quantity of valuable clinical data are left
   untouched, never becoming clinical publications that could potentially
   improve health care.

<p>The disproportion between data volume and number of qualified
   researchers can be explained by the growing complexity involved in
   outcomes research projects using secondary data analyses. Researchers
   have to formulate of a clinically relevant and methodologically sound
   research question, find appropriate data sources, perform statistical
   analyses, and generate a final manuscript that will be submitted for
   peer-review. Frequently, individual researchers have the training and
   time to perform a few of these steps, but the integration of all tasks
   calls for an interdisciplinary systems approach. This
   interdisciplinary effort, however, is often challenged by
   communication problems among researchers with different backgrounds,
   particularly when physicians with an exclusive clinical education
   attempt to work in collaboration with quantitative researchers such as
   statisticians. As a consequence, the output of such collaboration
   is either scarce or absent.

<p>This article describes a suite of web applications developed to
   facilitate the process of converting outcome databases into clinical
   manuscripts, to streamline the interdisciplinary collaboration of
   researchers, and to connect all different steps of the outcomes
   research process. To illustrate its use, we will describe how a
   research project has been conducted using this system from its early
   phase of research question formulation to the completion of the final
   manuscript.

<h>Construction and content

<p>The system of Web applications is composed by five different tools:
   QuestForm, Research Manager, Analysis Charts, and Literature Matrices.
   These tools were designed to assist researchers in each of the phases
   encountered in an outcomes research project involving secondary data
   analysis (Figure 1). All tools are freely available at a designated
   web site http://www.ceso.duke.edu. The following sections will
   describe each of the Web applications and their application in the
   answer of a real outcomes research question.

<h>QuestForm

<h>General description

<p>QuestForm, an acronym for "Question Formulation", is an application
   designed to assist researchers in the location of clinical databases
   and formulation of outcome research questions (Figure 2). Clinical
   databases contain raw data (observations from individual patients)
   from national administrative claim data, cohort studies, clinical
   trials, and registries (see http://www.ceso.duke.edu for an updated
   list). All databases have been de-identified and do not contain
   protected health information as specified by the Health Insurance
   Portability and Accountability Act (http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/hipaa/,
   accessed on Aug/04/2004). The application The application is built
   using Extensible HyperText Markup Language 1.0 (XHTML), Java, and
   a relational database (MySQL 4.0).

<p>QuestForm starts by presenting researchers with three main strategies
   to find research databases: use of pre-determined key words that
   describe the database as a unit (Figure 2), user-defined key words to
   describe variables present in the data dictionary of each database,
   and the presentation of a complete list of all databases. Once
   databases are located, researchers can read an overall summary about
   the database including details about number of subjects, sampling
   strategy, data ownership, and overall characteristics of the study
   population and associated procedures (Figure 3). Researchers then
   determine that the database most appropriate to answer the research
   question at hand, a JAVA screen is displayed for research question
   formulation (Figure 4). This screen presents all variables displayed
   in hierarchical categories. Variables are presented with the
   corresponding question and alternative responses. All variables can be
   inserted into a research question (Question Diagram) divided into the
   classical categories for an epidemiological question: Outcomes,
   Predictors, Confounders, Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. Search
   engines are provided for ICD9-CM diagnosis and procedure codes (Figure
   5), which can also be inserted into the Question Diagram. Finally,
   previously formulated Question Diagrams can be shared among
   researchers. This latter functionality allows researchers to both
   share Question Diagrams among members of the ongoing project as well
   as share previously formulated Question Diagrams with researchers from
   other teams. Once the question is fully formulated, researchers can
   save the question as in a graphical format known as Question Diagram.

<h>Outcomes research application

<p>Dr. Guller initiated the project searching for an existing database
   that would allow him to compare surgical outcomes between laparoscopic
   and open appendectomy procedures in the treatment of acute
   appendicitis. The outcomes were pre-specified as mortality and
   infection, although other existing outcomes would also be of interest.
   Although there are multiple single-institution studies attempting to
   answer this question, few studies have taken a population
   approach to test whether one procedure is superior to the other.

<p>As a first step, Dr. Guller searched across previously formulated
   Question Diagrams to evaluate whether other studies could have used a
   similar research design. Since none was found in QuestForm, Dr. Guller
   searched across more than forty different databases for an existing
   database that would have the variables to answer his research
   question. After navigating through multiple data dictionaries, Dr.
   Guller found that the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) Release 6,
   1997 presented the variables and an adequate number of patients to
   answer his question.

<p>Once the database was located, Dr. Guller selected the outcomes of
   interest (length of hospital stay, in-hospital complications,
   in-hospital mortality, rate of routine discharge), main predictors
   (laparoscopic versus open procedures), and confounders (age, gender,
   race, household income, comorbidity, hospital volume, location of the
   hospital, teaching status of hospital, and appendix perforation),
   inserting each of them into the research question fields in QuestForm.
   Using built-in search engines for ICD9 codes, Dr. Guller created the
   definition for each of the above-mentioned variables and defined the
   inclusion and exclusion criteria. The final research question was then
   saved as a Question Diagram and immediately submitted to Dr. Pietrobon
   for feasibility evaluation. Dr. Pietrobon judged that the project was
   feasible and could be completed using the database indicated by Dr.
   Guller. At this point, the project was initiated and a detailed
   project management plan was established using Research Manager.

<h>Research manager

<p>Research Manager is a Web application developed by our group designed
   to facilitate the project management of clinical research projects.
   Similar to QuestForm, Research Manager is licensed under the GNU
   Public License, which allows individuals to copy, modify, and
   freely distribute the software as long as the source code is provided.

<p>Research Manager provides multiple features to facilitate project
   management of clinical research projects. All projects are displayed
   by category (e.g., cardiology, general surgery, etc) with a brief
   description. The internal content of all projects is password
   protected. All internal tasks within a project are assigned to
   individual researchers. Project administrators initially assign
   deadlines that can be modified by task leaders within three days. All
   participating members of the project receive weekly reports containing
   details about the activity and the latest electronic file within each
   task (Figure 6). These files can include research questions, data
   analysis files, synthesis of a literature review, and manuscript
   drafts. Project members can also customize the application to receive
   updates for every single file uploaded to Research Manager in real
   time if they decide to closely track the project. Expired tasks are
   marked in the weekly report sent to the entire team, thus providing an
   incentive for investigators to keep tasks within planned deadlines.

<p>Research Manager helps identifying such problems and enables their
   early elimination, thus avoiding delays in the project completion.
   Finally, since weekly reports are generated to all participating
   members, Research Manager also provides peer-incentive for project
   members to complete their tasks in a timely manner.

<h>Outcomes research application

<p>Once the Question Diagram was evaluated by the clinical
   epidemiologist, this project was transferred to Research Manager.
   Contact information for each of the researchers involved and deadlines
   for completion of the main phases of the research process were set,
   including data extraction and cleaning, data analysis, literature
   review, and manuscript writing. Weekly reports were generated to
   update investigators on all tasks of the project, including different
   versions of the statistical analysis, modifications in the research
   question, and manuscript sections.

<p>With an established project plan, the statistician in charge selected
   the best methods for analysis. Since the database is a random sample
   of the United States and requires special survey analysis methods, it
   was necessary that all involved researchers understood the statistical
   approach by using Analysis Charts.

<h>Analysis charts

<p>Analysis Chart is a tool designed to enhance the understanding of
   statistical methods to a format that is understandable by clinical
   researchers with different previous levels of statistical knowledge.
   As such, it is important in the design as well as the analysis phases
   of a project (Figure 7). The application was built using Extensible
   HyperText Markup Language (XHTML 1.0) in combination with
   Cascading Style Sheets.

<p>Analysis charts are composed by cascading links that display
   information about quantitative methods in progressive levels of
   complexity called "layers of information". Each layer explains the
   statistical method with an increasing level of complexity. In this
   manner, clinicians interested in simply understanding the method to
   evaluate whether it can be applied to a research project can simply
   read the first three layers. In contrast, researchers interested in a
   direct application of the method to available research data can follow
   all layers and their respective references. Most commonly, complex
   techniques are presented using five layers of information. Layer 1
   summarizes the general goal of the method. Layer 2 presents previous
   clinical applications so that the researcher can visualize situations
   in which the method may be realistically applied. Layer 3 describes
   the data requirements for the application of the statistical
   technique. Layer 4 describes the basic statistical underpinnings of
   the method, initially breaking down equations and then reassembling
   them. Finally, layer 5 presents a list of available software packages
   for the implementation of the technique as well as cases studies where
   all previous layers are applied to real data sets. Each layer ends
   with a section containing selected references that explain the topic
   in more detail.

<h>Outcomes research application

<p>While deciding on the most appropriate analysis strategy for the
   Question Diagram, Drs. Pietrobon and Guller consulted the Analysis
   Chart searching for the most appropriate statistical methods of
   analysis. Given the nature of the research question and that the NIS
   database has a sample design, Drs. Guller and Pietrobon opted for an
   approach involving multiple and logistic regression models while
   adjusting for sampling weights, strata, and clusters. With a defined
   analysis protocol, the research question was then transferred to a
   statistical programmer trained in the translation of Question Diagrams
   into statistical code. This process was closely evaluated by Drs.
   Pietrobon and Guller, who scrutinized the statistical code and results
   from a clinical and statistical perspectives. Once the results were
   deemed to be accurate, Dr. Pietrobon started the literature review
   using a Literature Matrix.

<h>Literature matrices

<p>Literature matrices consist of a comprehensive but not necessarily
   exhaustive review of the literature focused on a narrow clinical topic
   (Figure 8). Each article is analyzed using the following criteria:
   study objectives, data sources, outcome variables, primary predictor
   variables, confounders, statistical analysis, results, established
   knowledge, and shortcomings. Each literature matrix is saved as an
   XHTML file that can be visualized in web browsers as well as imported
   in any commercial or open source spreadsheet applications such as
   Microsoft Excel^® or Open Office Calc [12].

<p>The advantage of the Literature Matrix as implemented in the Web suite
   is its availability over the web to the whole outcomes research
   community. This allows Literature Matrices to be constantly updated,
   with authors receiving their due credit in a list of contributors.
   Literature Matrices also enable researchers to obtain a complete
   summary of the literature without going through the cumbersome process
   of copying and reading a manuscript for the first time. In contrast,
   researchers' time can be spent more efficiently in reviewing what has
   already been compiled and attempting to expand the Literature Matrix
   with other relevant bibliographic references.

<p>In order to evaluate the literature, a graduate student performed a
   thorough literature search. All relevant articles were copied, read,
   and the data extracted according to the established categories. Once
   the Literature Matrix had been completed, Drs. Guller compared the
   current project results with results published in the literature. The
   structured information in Literature Matrices also allowed Dr. Guller
   to compare the strengths and weaknesses of the current project in
   relation to previous publications. Once this phase was completed, Dr.
   Guller proceeded to the final writing of the manuscript using Output
   Templates.

<p>At the end of the project, Dr. Guller combined the Question Diagram,
   Analysis Chart, and Literature Matrices to write the final manuscript.
   While Analysis Charts provided the information concerning the
   statistical techniques used in this study, Literature Matrices
   provided the basis for comparison of the study results against
   previous publications. Although not included in the final manuscript,
   Dr. Guller also had access to multiple analysis files through Research
   Manager to orient him in each of the steps taken during the research
   question formulation, data analysis, and literature review.

<h>Use of web application by clinical researchers

<p>The use of web applications by individual clinical researchers can be
   summarized in Figure 9.

<h>Utility

<p>Since the concept of streamlining the interdisciplinary collaboration
   preceded the existence of the current suite of web applications,
   different versions of the central idea have been gradually applied
   since the second half of 2002. Although our usability, qualitative,
   and economic studies to evaluate this application are still ongoing,
   we have noticed a significant improvement in the number and quality of
   our publications as evidenced by the increasing acceptance rates of
   our manuscripts for publication in peer-reviewed journals. The Web
   applications are currently used in research projects involving Duke
   University and other universities in the United States and abroad,
   where they have been shown to facilitate inter-institutional
   collaborations.

<h>Improving the efficiency of an interdisciplinary approach to secondary
   data analyses has multiple potential benefits. These include an
   increase in the overall clinical significance of the final
   publication, decrease in the number of failed projects, decrease in
   the time for completion of individual projects, improvement in the
   education of future outcomes researchers, decrease in the cost-benefit
   ratio for individual outcomes research projects, and, perhaps most
   importantly, an automation of repetitive tasks. This last factor is
   crucial since eliminating repetitive tasks will allow researchers to
   concentrate on the design of innovative projects.

<p>Surprisingly, few systems and applications have been described to
   solve the problem of complex interdisciplinary collaboration between
   clinicians and statisticians. Isolated approaches have usually focused
   on specific portions of the outcomes research process, without
   attempting to integrate them into a cohesive system. For example,
   Marshall has proposed the use of a secure Internet web site for
   collaborative medical research and data collection. While this system
   seems to achieve its proposed objectives, it does not improve the
   process of guiding teams in the translation of data into useful
   clinical information. Other systems have approached the process in a
   more comprehensive manner. The Research Toolbox, for example, is
   a software application that combines databases for literature searches
   in addition to providing templates for the scientific output. The
   system is applicable to any type of research, but lacks the ability to
   connect researchers over the World Wide Web. It also does not address
   the formulation of research questions from existing databases,
   selection of statistical techniques, exchange of manuscripts, or
   project management. Finally, the Web-based Medical Information
   Retrieval System (WebMIRS) project, funded by the National Library of
   Medicine, allows researchers not only to evaluate the database
   content but also to perform the data extraction of specific subsets of
   the data set. In spite of its high performance as a research tool,
   WebMIRS is currently restricted to one single publicly available
   database (National Health and Examination Survey - NHANES), and does
   not contribute to other phases of the outcomes research process.

<p>Although this newly developed system of applications provides a
   significant improvement in the way secondary data analyses are
   conducted, it still has limitations. First, because of the lack of a
   formal evaluation of the effectiveness of this system, we are unable
   to quantify its real time and cost saving benefits. Second, the system
   is currently restricted to secondary analyses and does not allow for
   the planning of prospective data collection. Although one of the main
   advantages of formulating a research question based on existing data
   sets is the bounded nature of the process, future applications should
   attempt to create rules and algorithms that may guide prospective data
   collection.

<h>Conclusion

<p>In summary, we have experienced that this system has significant
   advantages over the traditional manner of conducting outcomes research
   based on secondary data analyses. This tool may have important
   applications, not only resulting in an improvement in the overall
   efficiency of the outcomes research process, but also affecting the
   way new outcomes researchers are trained and introduced to a research
   environment.
