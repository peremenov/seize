<h>Recurrent cardiac events in patients with idiopathic ventricular
   fibrillation, excluding patients with the Brugada syndrome

<h>Background

<p>The recurrence of cardiac events in patients with idiopathic
   ventricular fibrillation (VF) excluding patients with the Brugada
   syndrome is unclear since this entity remains present in previous
   studies.

<h>Methods

<p>Since 1992, 18 patients (72% male) with idiopathic VF out of 455 ICD
   implants were treated with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator
   (ICD). The mean age at first ICD implantation was 42 ± 14 years.
   Brugada syndrome, as well as other primary electrical diseases (e.g.
   long QT), were systematically excluded in all patients by the absence
   of the typical electrocardiogram (ST elevation in the right precordial
   leads) at rest and/or after pharmacological tests (ajmaline,
   flecainide, or procainamide). Recurrence of cardiac events was
   prospectively assessed.

<h>Results

<p>During a mean follow-up period of 41 ± 27 months, VF recurrence with
   appropriate shock occurred in 7 patients (39%) covering a total of 27
   shocks. The median time to first appropriate shock was 12 ± 9 months.
   There were no deaths. In the electrophysiological study, 39% of
   patients were inducible, but inducibility failed to predict subsequent
   arrhythmic events. Forty-four percent of patients suffered 21
   inappropriate shocks, which were caused by sinus tachycardia, atrial
   arrhythmias or lead malfunction.

<h>Conclusion

<p>Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation patients have a high recurrence
   rate of potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmias, excluding patients
   with the Brugada syndrome or other known causes. ICD prevents sudden
   cardiac death but inappropriate shocks remained a major issue in this
   young and active population.

<h>Background

<p>Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF) is defined as spontaneous
   ventricular fibrillation in the absence of any structural heart
   disease, including coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease,
   myocarditis, cardiomyopathy or electrophysiological diseases, with a
   well-defined cause, such as the long QT syndrome, the Brugada
   syndrome, ventricular pre-excitation (WPW), and drug intoxication.
   The consensus statement of the joint steering committees of the UCARE
   registry of Europe and of the idiopathic VF registry of US reported in
   1997 that patients with the Brugada syndrome should be considered a
   variant of idiopathic VF.

<p>Brugada syndrome is characterized by a unique electrocardiographic
   (ECG) pattern of right bundle branch block with ST elevation in the
   right precordial leads. Transient forms of the disease in which the
   ECG normalizes for a period of time have been described.
   Administration of sodium channel blockers will unmask the abnormal ECG
   in patients with transient normalized ECGs. The American Heart
   Association has recently proposed diagnostic criteria for the Brugada
   syndrome. Moreover, the incidence of Brugada syndrome among
   patients with idiopathic VF remains unclear. The prevalence of a
   Brugada type ECG pattern was reported in 21% and 24% of
   idiopathic VF populations. However, on the basis of pharmacological
   tests, it has been speculated that up to 40% - 60% of patients
   diagnosed with idiopathic VF might actually suffer from the Brugada
   syndrome. Since this is a new clinical entity, older publications
   probably classified some patients with Brugada syndrome as idiopathic
   VF, since intravenous administration of a sodium channel blocker to
   unmask a concealed form of the disease was not systematically
   performed. Our report describes the clinical and electrophysiological
   characteristics of consecutive sudden cardiac arrest survivors from
   idiopathic VF who received an ICD, and in whom electrical and
   structural heart diseases including Brugada syndrome, long QT,
   arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, and hypertrophic
   cardiomyopathy characterized by a high recurrence rate, were
   systematically excluded.

<h>Methods

<h>Patient population

<p>The total population under investigation included 455 consecutive
   patients who received a third generation ICD, with stored electrograms
   capabilities for hemodynamically poorly tolerated ventricular
   tachyarrhythmias, from 1992 to 2000. Of these, 29 were initially
   diagnosed as idiopathic VF associated with a structurally normal
   heart, normal left and right ventricular ejection fraction and normal
   coronary arteries. During the follow-up, 11 patients developed a new
   diagnosis potentially explaining VF, and were excluded from the final
   analysis. Four had right ventricular dysplasia, 5 had Brugada syndrome
   with the typical ECG manifestations after a drug challenge, and 2
   patients had long QT syndrome. A final diagnosis of idiopathic VF was
   made in the remaining 18 patients. All patients had survived either an
   episode of cardiac arrest due to VF (12 patients) or a syncopal
   episode associated with documented self-terminating polymorphic
   ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (6 patients). In 15 patients,
   the documented VF was seen during daily activity (one episode during
   sustained effort) and in 3 patients, during night-time. Out of the 18
   patients, 10 had a previous history of unexplained syncope.

<h>Definitions and investigation

<p>Idiopathic VF was defined as VF in the absence of demonstrable cardiac
   abnormalities as previously reported. Thus, we excluded other
   known causes of VT/VF such as WPW syndrome, congenital long QT
   syndrome, short-coupled torsade de pointes, catecholamine-induced
   polymorphic VT, and Brugada syndrome. No patient had a past history of
   ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure or family history of
   unexpected sudden cardiac death. All patients had a normal physical
   examination, blood testing and exercise test. Structural heart disease
   was excluded in all by echocardiography, cardiac catheterization
   including right and left ventricular angiography and coronary
   angiography. Patients on anti-arhythmic therapy before their cardiac
   arrest were excluded from the study, as well as those with electrolyte
   disturbances, history of significant alcohol or drug abuse or
   prolonged QT[c]. Of the 18 patients, 10 patients had normal right
   ventricular endomyocardial biopsy and 8 patients had a normal cardiac
   magnetic resonance imaging. Moreover, in 5 patients, an ergonovine
   provocation test was performed to exclude coronary artery spasm.
   Brugada syndrome was systematically excluded in all patients by
   negative serial ECG recordings with the typical coved or saddle
   shaped-type ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads. All
   patients received iv administration of a sodium channel blocker to
   unmask a concealed form of the disease and all tests were negative.
   Flecainide (2 mg/kg body weight) was used in 9 patients, procainamide
   (10 mg/kg body weight) in 4 patients, and ajmaline (0.7 mg/kg body
   weight) in 7 patients.

<h>Electrophysiological study

<p>Programmed electrical stimulation was performed in all patients using
   up to 3 extra-stimuli at 3 different drive cycle lengths (600, 500,
   and 430 ms) delivered to the right ventricular apex. The coupling
   interval of the first 2 extra-stimuli was not shorter than 180 ms and
   not shorter than 200 ms for the third extra-stimuli. In case of
   non-inducibility, programmed stimulation was also performed from the
   right ventricular outflow tract. Sustained VF was defined as VF at a
   cycle length =< 200 ms and lasting >= 30 seconds or requiring
   immediate defibrillation. Sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) was
   defined as VT lasting >= 30 seconds or requiring termination secondary
   to hemodynamic instability. Non-sustained VT was defined as >6
   consecutive ventricular complexes or VT lasting <30 seconds.

<h>ICD implantation

<p>All patients received a transvenous ICD with stored electrograms.
   Recorded episodes were reviewed and adjudicated as appropriate or
   inappropriate therapies. VF was defined at follow-up as consecutive
   ventricular beats recorded from the device at a cycle length of 240
   msec or less. In all patients, the ICD was programmed with only 1
   ventricular fibrillation detection zone at 180 bpm (333 msec). Only
   shock therapy was programmed. All patients were seen at follow-up in
   our centre.

<h>Statistical analysis

<p>All data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Kaplan-Meier
   analysis was used to analyze time intervals until the first
   appropriate shock.

<h>Results

<p>The study cohort consisted of 13 men and 5 women (Table 1), with a
   mean age at the first ICD implantation of 42 ± 14 years (range 20 to
   70 years). Baseline electrocardiograms were normal in 16 patients. One
   patient had a left bundle branch block and 1 had a right bundle branch
   block. The mean QT[c ]for the entire population was 410 ± 20 msec. All
   patients had a normal left ventricular ejection fraction (>= 50%)
   without regional wall motion abnormalities. Mean left ventricular
   ejection fraction (EF) was 69 ± 8% (range 52 to 81%). No patient had
   significant coronary artery disease (defined as >= 50% stenosis).
   Microscopic examination of right ventricular biopsy specimens in 10
   patients showed no evidence of a viral, infiltrative or dysplasic
   process in the myocardium. Baseline electrophysiological studies were
   performed in all patients and showed normal sinus node,
   atrioventricular node and His-Purkinje function in all. Inducible
   sustained ventricular arrhythmias occurred in 7 patients (39%). From
   these, 4 patients had sustained VF and 3 patients had sustained
   inducible monomorphic VT or ventricular flutter (cycle length 230 ± 20
   ms). Two extra-stimuli were required in 5 patients and 3 extra-stimuli
   in 2 patients. Non-sustained VT-VF was induced in 3 patients. No
   arrhythmia could be induced in 8 patients.

<h>Long-term outcome

<p>After a mean follow-up of 41 ± 27 months (ranging from 5 to 92
   months), 7 of the 18 patients (39%) with idiopathic VF had VF or
   sustained polymorphic VT recurrence and received appropriate shocks
   (Table 1). These patients experienced a total of 27 shocks; 5 of them
   had more than 1 episode (2 to 7). Mean time to first appropriate shock
   was 12 ± 9 months (ranging from 0.4 to 27 months). No arrhythmic storm
   was observed at follow-up (defined as >= 3 separate VT/VF episodes
   within 24 h). With the use of stored electrograms, 6 patients had
   documented non-sustained polymorphic VT or VF for a total of 149
   episodes (range 1 to 120). Four of them have not received any
   appropriate shock. These episodes were detected by the ICD but shock
   delivery was appropriately aborted by the non-committed function of
   the device. There was no relationship between the initial clinical and
   arrhythmic presentation and subsequent arrhythmic events recorded from
   the ICD at follow-up (Table 1). From the intracardiac electrograms,
   the arrhythmia initiation was always associated with PVCs with a mean
   coupling interval of 300 ± 35 ms. A long-short initiating sequence of
   VF was never observed. In 5 patients, multiple VF episodes were
   recorded by the ICD, all of which for a single patient were associated
   with the same PVC coupling interval. Since the stored electrograms in
   the present study were obtained from endocardial sites and were
   single-channel recordings, we could not assess the origin of the PVCs.
   The mean QTc at the time of VF recurrence was normal in all patients
   (mean 418 ± 22 msec). The ICD effectively recognized and promptly
   treated all the polymorphic VT or VF recurrences and prevented the
   possible occurrence of sudden cardiac death. No death was reported
   during follow-up. Non-invasive follow-up examinations failed to detect
   any new structural heart disease or primary electrical disease such as
   long QT or Brugada syndrome.

<h>Value of electrophysiological Testing

<p>Programmed electrical stimulation failed to predict subsequent cardiac
   events. The sensitivity and specificity were 43 and 64%, respectively.
   The positive and negative predictive values were also 43 and 64%,
   respectively, that is not considered clinically useful.

<h>Causes and incidence of inappropriate shocks

<p>In this population, we observed a high incidence of inappropriate
   shocks. Eight of the 18 patients (44%) received an inappropriate shock
   for a total of 21 discharges. Atrial fibrillation was responsible for
   57% of them (12 episodes in 4 patients). These were older patients
   with a mean age of 53 ± 14 years. Six inappropriate shocks (4
   patients) were triggered by sinus tachycardia. These patients were
   younger with a mean age of 31 ± 13 years. Lead malfunction caused 3
   inappropriate shocks in 2 patients. Six shocks in 2 patients were
   classified as of unknown cause, even after careful examination of the
   intracardiac electrograms. These shocks were probably inappropriate
   since no clinical symptoms occurred during these episodes and these 2
   patients already experienced inappropriate shocks for atrial
   fibrillation.

<h>Device follow-up

<p>During the follow-up period, first-time generator replacement was
   performed in 9 patients after a mean of 43 ± 11 months after initial
   implantation (range 21 to 58). End of life battery was the indication
   for replacement in 8 patients, and 1 had an ICD component failure. A
   second replacement was done in 2 patients. Lead replacement was also
   indicated in 2 patients for lead insulation fracture. Adjunctive
   anti-arrhythmic drugs were required in 11 patients after ICD
   implantation in order to control for the occurrence of appropriate or
   inappropriate shocks (Table 1).

<h>Discussion

<p>To our knowledge, this report is the first study to describe the
   clinical outcome of ICD patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic VF in
   whom the Brugada syndrome, characterized by a high recurrence rate,
   was systematically excluded. Since there is a wide variability in the
   ECG expression in individual patients with the Brugada syndrome, we
   performed iv administration of sodium channel blockers to unmask the
   ECG features of the syndrome in all our idiopathic VF patients. Two
   studies reported the long-term outcome of patients with idiopathic VF
   without the Brugada syndrome. Viskin et al. performed iv
   administration of a sodium channel blocker to unmask a concealed form
   of Brugada syndrome in only 15 % of their idiopathic VF population,
   whereas Remme et al. tested the effect of an iv sodium channel
   blocker on ECG morphology in only 30% of the patients. The unique
   finding of the present report is the high recurrence rate of sustained
   ventricular arrhythmias in this well-characterized idiopathic VF
   group, even after a careful systematic evaluation to exclude the
   presence of Brugada syndrome. After a mean follow-up of 41 ± 27
   months, 39% of the patients received an appropriate ICD discharge for
   VF or polymorphic VT. In accordance with references, ICD therapy
   offered good protection against fatal outcome due to recurrent
   ventricular arrhythmias, with no mortality during the follow-up. The
   high recurrence rate is consistent with the relatively high recurrence
   rate of arrhythmic events or sudden death from the UCARE registry, as well as the high frequency of electrical discharges from ICDs
   reported in a large series of patients with idiopathic VF. In
   comparison, appropriate ICD discharges have been reported in 48% of
   arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia population, 40 to 56%
   of inducible population receiving an ICD and 23% (7%/year) in
   the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy population. However, some authors
   have reported a more benign clinical course of their idiopathic VF
   population with a lower recurrence rate. Our high ICD
   discharge rate might also be explained by the rapid ICD intervention
   for fast ventricular arrhythmia that could have been self-terminated.
   The definition of idiopathic VF remains problematic, since numerous
   studies including idiopathic VF population are heterogeneous. Indeed,
   61% (11/18 patients) of our cohort remained free of sustained
   arrhythmia recurrence during follow-up despite the same initial VF or
   syncopal presentation. Of note, idiopathic VF is always a diagnosis of
   exclusion. The patients in our cohort, as well as in other reported
   series, had normal hearts, as defined by clinical, non-invasive and
   invasive testing. Even after a careful investigation, a transient
   phenomenon such as a reversible localized myocardial disease, silent
   myocardial ischemia due to coronary artery spasm or sudden
   manifestation of an unknown primary electrophysiological disease could
   easily be missed by the clinician, and be responsible for the VF
   episode. Idiopathic VF is in fact an amalgam of different diseases in
   which the first clinical manifestation is VF. The ultimate answer
   probably lies in a more comprehensive approach and a more precise
   understanding of the molecular genetics and associated
   electrophysiological abnormalities in finding a specific treatment
   avoiding ICD implantation with its associated complications.

<p>Anti-arrhythmic drugs have also been used in this clinical condition.
   Belhassen et al. reported excellent results in their idiopathic
   VF population with EP-guided therapy using Class 1A drugs, primarily
   quinidine; no death occurred during a mean follow-up of >9 years.
   Recent evidence also suggests that frequent premature ventricular
   contractions arising from the Purkinje system are responsible for
   initiation of ventricular fibrillation, and can be mapped and ablated
   in selected patients. Until another proven therapy has been
   assessed prospectively, the possibility of VF recurrence mandates ICD
   implantation as currently proposed in ICD guidelines.

<h>Electrophysiological findings

<p>The inducibility rate (39%) of sustained VT/VF observed in our study
   is also in accordance with the results of the UCARE registry. Of
   importance, programmed electrical stimulation was of limited value
   with a poor sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, inducibility failed
   to predict subsequent arrhythmic events. Our findings differ from the
   observed 79% average inducibility rate reported by Belhassen et al. This may be due to different patient characteristics and
   stimulation protocol. Our study excluded patients with Brugada
   syndrome known to have a high inducibility rate. Compared to our
   stimulation protocol, Belhassen et al. used up to 3
   extra-stimuli, 2 basic cycle lengths, 2 RV sites (first RVA, then
   RVOT), and repetition of extra-stimulation (n = 10 for double, and n =
   5 for triple) at the shortest coupling intervals that resulted in
   ventricular capture. Three patients had a fast monomorphic VT
   inducible even if the clinical presentation was aborted sudden cardiac
   death. This may suggest an underlying structural heart disease
   undetected by the current investigation. Although general cardiac
   function can be normal, patients might have discrete abnormalities,
   which are currently unidentifiable. Better risk stratification is
   required to identify patients who will experience recurrent VF over
   time. Therefore, defibrillator implantation could be seen as the
   primary therapy in patients with idiopathic VF, since no
   stratification has yet identified patients at risk of arrhythmia
   recurrence.

<h>ICD limitations

<p>The impact of multiple battery replacements over time in this young
   population with idiopathic VF needs to be emphasized. It is noteworthy
   that half the population (9/18 patients) had an ICD replacement and 2
   other patients had their transvenous lead replaced during follow-up.
   We also observed a high incidence of inappropriate shocks (44%),
   mainly caused by atrial fibrillation and sinus tachycardia. This is
   well in accordance with other studies where up to 40% inappropriate
   discharge rates were observed even with fourth generation ICDs.
   The addition of an anti-arrhythmic drug to decrease the incidence of
   inappropriate shocks was required in this group. Four patients
   experienced atrial fibrillation, which might indicate the presence of
   an associated primary electrophysiological disease also affecting the
   atrium. In patients with idiopathic VF, the characteristics, is the
   recurrence of VF and not monomorphic VT compared to other ventricular
   arrhythmias. To decrease the number of inappropriate shocks, one
   should program a higher VF zone around 200-220 bpm and a lower
   monitoring zone to detect atrial arrhythmia. Third-generation ICD
   still have limitations and complications over time, with a significant
   proportion of patients having hardware-related complications or
   inappropriate shocks. Future developments in ICD technology is
   needed, which will hopefully address these issues.

<h>Conclusions

<p>Idiopathic VF patients have a high recurrence rate of ventricular
   arrhythmias, even after the systematic exclusion of patients with the
   Brugada syndrome or other known electrical diseases from the analysis.
   ICD prevents sudden cardiac death in this population, but treat only
   the final manifestation of an unknown disease. Inappropriate shocks
   remain a major concern in this young population.
