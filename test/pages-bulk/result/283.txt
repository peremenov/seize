<h>Attack on panel politics

<p>The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) Monday asked the
   Bush Administration's chief ethics officer to tighten up conflict of
   interest rules for members of scientific advisory bodies. CSPI's
   17-page letter to Amy L. Comstock, director of the US Office of
   Government Ethics, was prompted by months of protest over the alleged
   ideological loading of committees that advise the government on
   science policy, said Virginia Sharpe, director of CSPI's Integrity in
   Science project.
<p>Twenty-one signatories of CSPI's letter include David Bellinger, a
   Harvard researcher who is on the Centers for Disease Control and
   Prevention advisory panel for childhood lead poisoning, and Michael
   Weitzman, a University of Rochester pediatrician who was dropped from
   the panel in favor of an appointee described by critics as
   "industry-supported".
<p>Comstock is attending a conference and was unable to comment on the
   letter, her office said Tuesday.
<p>In past statements, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
   Secretary Tommy Thompson's office has defended controversial shakeouts
   of science advisory panels as the privilege of the party in power, and
   as a means of ensuring that diverse interests are represented.
<p>By invoking existing ethical laws, CSPI hopes to get action on the
   issue, Sharpe told The Scientist.
<p>"They get to load the dice up to a point," Sharpe said. "We're not
   taking issue with ideological appointments. We are taking issue with
   conflicts of a financial nature where there are rules already in
   place."
<p>CSPI's letter is part of a renewed barrage from groups challenging HHS
   chief Thompson to halt what they view as the stacking of science
   panels to promote religious or commercial interests, rather than
   science.
<p>Lawmakers including Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Senators
   Hillary Clinton (D-NY) and Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) have been
   questioning Thompson's appointment practices since last fall.
   Disappointed with a lack of responsiveness from the HHS chief, Kennedy
   planned to make the matter the focus of special hearings in February,
   according to Kennedy spokesman Jim Manley. The pressure for war on
   Iraq, however, moved that plan to the back burner for now, Manley
   said.
<p>In late February, the National Academies of Science public policy
   committee voted to create a panel to study recruiting and appointment
   practices to see if changes to current policies are in order.
<p>On March 5, the American Association for the Advancement of Science
   (AAAS) issued a resolution calling on the government to make sure
   science advisors represent a "fair balance" of viewpoints. Approved by
   AAAS's board of directors and its council, the resolution was based on
   the 1972 Federal Advisory Committee Act, which requires balance.
<p>CSPI's letter also invokes the FAC Act, which in addition to balance
   requires provisions "to assure that the advice and recommendations of
   the advisory committee will not be inappropriately influenced by the
   appointing authority or by any special interest."
<p>Thompson has yet to respond to a similar letter the group sent in
   December. According to CSPI, ethics chief Comstock has the power to
   issue government-wide ethical guidance that would cure many of the
   criticisms of the panel appointment process.
<p>Changes urged in the letter would force scientists who advise the
   government to disclose more of their financial dealings and create a
   presumption that financial complications should be avoided.
<p>CSPI wants agencies to reveal more about the financial ties of
   scientific advisors and cut back on the use of waivers that allow some
   people to evade conflict rules on the premise that their expertise is
   unique and not available from an uncompromised source.
<p>"We are perfectly willing to say the administration should have
   discretion in creating committees that share its ideology," Sharpe
   said. "But it does not have discretion to undermine the independence
   of the scientific advisory process."
