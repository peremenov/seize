<h>Central bank oversight of payment and settlement systems

<h>Foreword

<p>Central banks have always had a close interest in the safety and
   efficiency of payment and settlement systems. One of the principal
   functions of central banks is to be the guardian of public confidence
   in money, and this confidence depends crucially on the ability of
   economic agents to transmit money and financial instruments smoothly
   and securely through payment and settlement systems. The systems must
   therefore be strong and reliable, available even when the markets
   around them are in crisis and never themselves the source of such
   crisis.

<p>Central banks have traditionally influenced payment and settlement
   systems primarily by being banks which provide a variety of payment
   and settlement services to other banks. As such, central banks provide
   a safe settlement asset and in most cases they operate systems which
   allow for the transfer of that settlement asset. It is only relatively
   recently that oversight has become a function that is more formal and
   systematic - namely a function whereby the objectives of safety and
   efficiency are promoted by monitoring existing and planned systems,
   assessing them against these objectives and, where necessary, inducing
   change. However, although recent, this development in the nature of
   oversight has been rapid and the function has now come to be generally
   recognised as a core responsibility of central banks.

<p>Given this importance, and the experience that has been gained over
   the years, the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems felt it
   would be useful to set out publicly what has been learned about
   effective oversight. Most of this report is descriptive and
   analytical, explaining why and how central banks oversee payment and
   settlement systems. It looks at the need for oversight, the source of
   central banks' responsibilities for oversight, the scope of oversight
   and the activities that oversight involves. In addition it looks at
   cooperative oversight, where more than one central bank or other
   authority has responsibilities for a system. However, as well as this
   description and analysis, the report also includes 10 principles for
   effective oversight, each with explanatory text. Five of the
   principles are generally applicable to oversight arrangements while
   the other five are specifically for cooperative oversight
   arrangements. All the principles are consistent with, and indeed
   largely drawn from, the previous work on payment and settlement
   systems published by the Committee and earlier groups reporting to the
   G10 Governors.

<p>The Committee set up a Working Group on Oversight of Payment and
   Settlement Systems to help it produce this report. The CPSS is very
   grateful to the members of the working group, its chairman, Martin
   Andersson of Sveriges Riksbank, and the CPSS secretariat at the BIS
   for their excellent work in preparing this report.
