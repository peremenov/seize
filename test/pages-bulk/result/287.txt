<h>Mintel's Global New Products Database Trend Predictions for 2003

<p>Some things to look forward to! The predictions by Mintel's Global New
   Products Database for what will be hot or not in 2003.

<h>Cuisine of the year

<p>Asian. Easy to prepare and healthy, Asian foods will experience a
   surge in popularity in 2003. Always flying just under the radar by
   being available as take-out and at some deli counters, the appeal for
   Asian-inspired foods will propel mass production by manufacturers.
   Frozen meals and meal kits (perhaps in the refrigerated section
   because of the heavy veggie component) will be the first to show
   development.

<h>Look of the year

<p>Simplicity. Clean graphics with minimal print on packs will be what
   hooks consumers in 2003. And manufacturers won't have to figure how to
   fit every 'low fat, low calorie,
   you-won't-gain-an-ounce-by-eating-this-product' claim on a package.

<h>Flavour of the year

<p>Citrus. Nothing new, but getting extremely popular. And everyone needs
   vitamin C. Runner up - Wasabi! (Wasabi is a plant, the extracts of
   which are used as a condiment to flavour dishes such as sushi.)

<h>Scent of the year

<p>Vanilla. This traditional scent is popping up everywhere in skincare,
   fragrances, and even teas. We'll be seeing more of a good thing.

<h>Ingredient of the year

<p>White tea. Green tea was all the rage for the last three years; now it
   is white tea's turn. It's already appeared in skincare products and,
   of course, tea. Expect this ingredient, which is chock-full of
   beneficial anti-oxidants, to be popping up in vitamins and healthcare
   products, haircare, and other food products.

<h>Kids with mature tastebuds

<p>Children generate billions in business and manufacturers have tuned
   in. In 2001 we saw 'mystery' ketchup colors, blue french fries, and,
   most recently, green pancake syrup from the Mrs Butterworth's brand.
   In essence, products that were already kid-friendly got more so. In
   2002, however, we expect to find that kids are going to be the target
   for products that have been considered only to be appealing to the
   adult market. For example, coffee. Coffee drinkers are getting
   younger, and with the growing appeal of RTD iced coffees and the
   mammoth spread of Starbucks, we predict that there will soon be a
   kid-targeted coffee drink.

<h>Going the distance

<p>Ten years ago, the newest fad was having your make up tattooed to your
   face. It never seemed to catch on, but it did highlight the desire
   women have for longer-lasting, no-mess cosmetics. We now have
   long-lasting lipsticks and a three-day wear last tint but the next
   area up for semi-permanence is fragrances. Potent, but not
   overpowering, scents will last until you take them off.

<h>Beverages crossover

<p>We've seen a surge in amorphous beverage and dairy drinks of late. Is
   it a soda, a juice, a milk drink, a meal replacement beverage? This
   trend is primed to burst like a shaken can of soda in 2003.
   Manufacturers are playing with all sorts of products with niche
   appeal. Perhaps juice-flavored milk packed with nutrients to replace a
   meal? A yogurt drink with fizz?

<h>Puppy love

<p>Are pets people? Expect to see gourmet cat and dog food, perhaps the
   kind you store in the refrigerator next to your own food, to be mass
   produced in 2003. We've seen bakery kits that allow owners to make
   their own doggie bones and premium-priced single-servings of pet food.

<h>The universal sauce

<p>Spiked ketchup, mixed-up mayo - we've seen these seasoned products hit
   the market in 2002. And with each new product we see, we wonder when
   we will find the 'universal sauce'. Something like a hot and spicy,
   but mild-mannered sauce that can serve every application and please
   everyone. We soon won't need more than one bottle in the fridge.

<h>Downsizing carbs

<p>Manufacturers will be busy reformulating everything they can to be low
   in carbohydrates. Anheuser-Busch did it with Michelob Ultra and a new
   reformulation of Doc's Hard Lemonade and now the Atkins diet is
   getting even more buzz as consumers wonder whether this whole low fat,
   low calorie thing they've been cottoning to for the last ten years is
   the right choice. Expect to see the 'low carbohydrate' claim push over
   the 'low fat' claim.

<h>Beverages get hip

<p>This year was packed with events and promotions that were geared
   toward the urban market. Sprite held a Summer Liquid Mix Tour that
   offered entertainment, fashion, and music, SoBe sponsored the ESPN
   Rock 'N' Rip tour in early 2002, and we're all familiar with those
   popular Pepsi commercials and ads. We expect more of a musical tie-in
   with alcoholic beverages next year, as artists continue to incorporate
   them into their songs and videos. And with hip-hop mogul Jay-Z
   recently purchasing a brand of vodka, this prediction will prosper.
