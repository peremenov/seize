<h>THERMODYNAMICS AND FREE ENERGY

<p>The mainstream scientific community dismisses the idea of "Free
   Energy" or "Over-Unity" machines because they say that the behavior of
   such machines violates the "Second Law of Thermodynamics." The purpose
   of this article is to squarely face this issue from an alternative
   science point of view. Many engineers and inventors, working in the
   alternative energy field, still mistakenly believe that the "Laws of
   Thermodynamics" are universally true. For them, the "free energy"
   machine can only be a clever scientific slight of hand where the
   machine becomes "outlaw", breaking some fundamental universe law. For
   progress to be made in this field, the limitations and errors inherent
   in the "Laws of Thermodynamics" must be exposed. Only then will people
   realize that scientific experimentation is the only reliable tool for
   revealing the behavior of physical reality.

<p>In order to bring this about, it will be helpful to quickly review
   some of the pivotal historical events which helped shape the modern
   scientific era with regards to thermodynamics. Before the year 1800,
   perpetual motion machines were considered possible and heat was not
   regarded as a form of energy. Both of these long standing assumptions,
   dating back thousands of years, were effectively toppled by the ideas
   of Hermann von Helmholtz in 1847 when he postulated that since no one
   had ever been able to build a working perpetual motion machine, that
   just probably, it was not possible. In order to deny the possibility
   of perpetual motion and hold the argument together, he had to assume
   that energy in the system was being conserved. It had long been
   observed that mechanical devices could not transfer energy perfectly.
   There was always some friction in the working parts. Friction was not
   only known to impede the transfer of energy in the machine, but it was
   known to produce heat. In order to simultaneously explain the work
   loss and the heat gain, so that conservation could be satisfied,
   Helmholtz postulated that heat was a form of energy consisting of a
   small, random motion in the molecules of matter. He went on to
   speculate that the loss of work in the machine as large scale motion
   was still present as heat in the small scale motion of the molecules
   in the material the machine was made of. He suggested from this that
   both the heat and work must be considered energy, and that it was the
   total that was conserved, rather than the heat or work separately.

<p>By 1850, Rudolf Clausius was able to synthesize the work of Helmholtz,
   James Joule, Sadi Carnot and others to express a generalized statement
   that has become known as the "First Law of Thermodynamics." It states
   that "energy can be changed from one form to another, but it is
   neither created nor destroyed." By the time this thought became
   universally believed, it had totally transformed the intellectual
   landscape of mechanics, physics and energy dynamics. This was a clean
   break from the set of thoughts and assumptions that had come forward
   from antiquity. A new era in science had begun.

<p>In understanding these historical developments, it is important to
   realize that besides the new theoretical explanation about the nature
   of heat, all of the other data that led to the new theoretical
   generalizations was derived experimentally. This can be illustrated by
   an observation made by Sadi Carnot in his extensive work regarding the
   behavior of heat in machines. He states that "in all cases in which
   work is produced by the agency of heat, a quantity of heat is consumed
   that is proportional to the work done; and conversely, by the
   expenditure of an equal quantity of work, an equal quantity of heat is
   produced." This statement by Carnot was based on hundreds of
   experimental measurements. After such convincing experimentation, it
   was not unreasonable for Clausius to conclude that heat could be
   converted into mechanical work. It was, however, a theoretical leap of
   logic to conclude that energy, in general, could be changed from one
   form to another.

<p>Before we go on, it is important, for our purposes, to be reminded
   that this new idea expressed as the "First Law of Thermodynamics"
   consists of a number of overlapping ideas and assumptions that can be
   expressed as follows:

<l>Perpetual motion machines are impossible

<l>The nature of heat is reduced to the random motions of molecular
   matter

<l>Energy can be changed from one form to another without any
   explanation as to how this conversion is actually accomplished in any
   specific case

<l>Energy is not created in or destroyed by its passage through a
   mechanism

<l>All forms of energy behave the same way

<p>All of these ideas are fundamentally inherent in "The First Law of
   Thermodynamics." From an alternative science point of view, the
   experimental work of Carnot and Joule will stand for all time. It is
   the intellectual overlay of Helmholtz and Clausius, on this
   experimental work, where the problems are introduced. The theory of
   conversion and the ideas about the nature of heat will be taken up
   again later in this article, after more ground work has been laid.

<p>The "Second Law of Thermodynamics" evolved out of further studies of
   the behavior of heat in closed systems. Remarkably, there is no one
   statement that is universally recognized as the definitive expression
   of this so called "Law". Among the more popular statements which
   reflect the general understanding of the "Second Law of
   Thermodynamics" are the following: "In a closed system, entropy does
   not decrease", "The state of order in a closed system does not
   spontaneously increase without the application of work", "Among all
   the allowed states of a system with given values of energy, number of
   particles and constraints, one and only one is a stable equilibrium
   state", and "It is impossible to construct a device that operates in a
   cycle and produces no other effect than the production of work and
   exchange of heat with a single reservoir." For those who can fathom
   the language, these statements clearly do not all express the same
   idea. Some have broad ramifications while others are more narrowly
   defined. All of these statements grew out of the idea, expressed
   fairly well as the last statement in the series, that a perpetual
   motion machine could not be made that operated on the principle of a
   work/heat exchange when this process was limited to a known quantity
   of heat at the start. After that amount of heat was converted to work
   and the temperature of the reservoir was reduced to the ambient
   temperature outside, no further work could be expected to be produced.
   This is not only reasonable, but it is backed up by thousands of
   experiments. As long as the "Law" is clearly and narrowly defined as a
   statement that reflects upon the behavior of heat in closed systems,
   this author has no problem with agreeing completely.

<p>Problems arise, however, with some of the more generalized
   interpretations of the "Law" such as "the state of order in a closed
   system does not spontaneously increase without the application of
   work." In order to understand why this statement is not universally
   true, it is important to clearly define our terms. We must understand
   what is meant by the "state of order" in a system, and we must define
   the boundaries of the "closure" of that system. In the first case, the
   "state of order" in the system is generally regarded as the
   temperature. Understanding this, we can rephrase this statement to
   say, that in a thermally isolated enclosure, the temperature will not
   increase unless work or energy is added to the system. Here again, by
   clearly defining our terms, and limiting the discussion to heat and
   work, we have a universally true statement backed up by mountains of
   experimental data. If, however, we define the "state of order" as a
   generalized "quantity of energy", and we further define the "closed
   system" as the Universe, we are led to believe that under no
   circumstance is it possible to create a condition where the
   concentration of energy will increase spontaneously. This is not true!

<p>While it should be understood that most known chemical processes,
   standard electrical equipment and heat generally do behave this way,
   the Etheric Energy Field of the planet does not. The Etheric Energy
   Field behaves in direct opposition to the more generalized
   understandings of the "Second Law of Thermodynamics" and this fact is
   backed up by considerable experimental data. One of the best
   documented examples of this is the spontaneous temperature rise
   observed in the "orgone accumulator", invented by Dr. Wilhelm Reich in
   1940. Here, a simple enclosure made of alternating layers of organic
   and inorganic material, allows the ambient density of the Etheric
   Energy Field to become more concentrated in the local area, without
   the application of work. This new and higher energy concentration is
   then reflected as a spontaneous rise in temperature. This situation
   does not break the "Second Law" in the narrow case, because we admit
   that new energy is entering the system. It does break the "Second Law"
   in the general case because this energy is entering without the
   application of external work. Reich's accumulator was designed as an
   attempt to shield and isolate this energy from its presence in the
   environment. His data clearly showed, however, that he was not able to
   isolate the energy effects inside the accumulator because the Etheric
   Energy Field easily penetrated the walls of the enclosure. He
   eventually realized that with regard to Etheric Energy Fields, it was
   impossible to "close the system" in the local sense. This is important
   to understand because it directly refutes the assumption that the
   universe consists only of closed systems at all levels of activity.

<p>Here then is a major problem with how the scientific community regards
   the "Laws of Thermodynamics." When the discussion is limited to the
   behavior of heat in closed systems, the "Second Law of Thermodynamics"
   is a well tested and accurate description of what happens under those
   circumstances. It is when it is incorrectly assumed that all forms of
   energy behave this way and that enclosure of the system is possible at
   all levels, that grossly false conclusions can be drawn from what
   started out as experimentally derived observations. The scientific
   community-at-large obviates these problems simply by denying the
   existence of the Etheric Energy Field because it doesn't fit within
   their intellectual model. Unfortunately for them, the mounting
   experimental evidence is making this increasingly hard to do.

<p>Certainly, the best evidence to date of the existence of the Etheric
   Energy Field and its capability of being drawn to high concentrations
   without the application of work is demonstrated by the Etheric Weather
   Engineering techniques developed by Trevor James Constable and his
   Atmos Engineering group. As a member of this group, I have personally
   seen how simple Etheric Energy projectors, that do no work in the
   classical sense, can cause the etheric potentials in the atmosphere to
   rise to such high concentrations that millions of gallons of water
   will precipitate from the air for hours at a time.

<p>When these Etheric Energy projectors are motorized, they draw a few
   hundred watts of electric energy. If the rain produced is dropped
   behind a dam and then released through a hydro-electric turbine, the
   electrical energy gain in the system can be enormous, on the order of
   100,000 to 1. This method of creating "free energy" is a practical
   reality today. While I know of no community using this method for
   supplying its energy needs, it is eminently practicable. This example
   is theoretical in the sense that it has never been done, but it is a
   good model of other "free energy" systems under development around the
   world today.

<p>Because the input to motorize the Etheric Energy projectors is
   electric and the output from the hydro-electric generators is
   electric, many people might mistake this for a so-called "over-unity"
   system. There is nothing "over-unity" about this situation. Each and
   every component of the machinery used in this system has operational
   and frictional losses. The energy tapped by the system is the
   atmospheric ether and all of the energy gain in the system occurs
   outside of the equipment. The fact that a small electric input yields
   a huge electric output does not mean the system is operating
   "over-unity.

<p>The problem with the "over-unity" concept goes back to the "First Law
   of Thermodynamics" and its inherent idea about the ability to convert
   one form of energy into another. This assumption includes the idea
   that these various conversions are accomplished at known and accepted
   rates of exchange. The idea of efficiency of conversion requires that
   the various rates of exchange are fixed and act as an upper limit for
   the calculation of a ratio that approaches one (100%) where the
   numerator of this fraction is the "output" and the denominator is the
   "input." Since it is generally agreed that every machine experiences
   so-called losses, the idea that this ratio could be greater than one
   is, of course, ridiculous. This, coupled with the assumption in the
   "Second Law" that all energy systems are closed, (meaning that no new
   energy can enter the system in-between the "input" and the "output")
   makes the idea of an "over-unity" system even more impossible than a
   mere perpetual motion machine. The line of logic embodied in the "Laws
   of Thermodynamics" is flawless. The problem doesn't exist in the
   logic, but it does illustrate that logic alone is not enough to reveal
   the truth. The problem exists in certain interpretations of these
   "Laws." Let's go back and look at the "First Law" again in light of
   our "over-unity" discussion. "Energy can be changed from one form to
   another, but it is neither created nor destroyed." This seems simple
   enough to understand. Underneath the surface, however, there is an
   assumption that this also means that energy will not spontaneously
   appear or disappear from the system. This is also a necessary
   condition if conservation of energy is to be satisfied LOCALLY as well
   as UNIVERSALLY.

<p>This discussion becomes relevant, for instance, in describing the
   operation of the rotating magnet generator, the so called N-machine or
   Space Power Generator (SPG). Most of the important work in this field
   has been done by Bruce DePalma and Parmahamsa Tewari. The following is
   a brief summary. The rotation of the magnet sets up two force fields
   that act at right angles to each other. These two force fields are the
   radially distributed inertial frame of space (centrifugal force) and
   the intersecting axially distributed magnetic field of the rotating
   magnet. The area of magnetized, polarized, inertial space appears to
   open up a region through which new energy can enter the system. When
   careful measurements are taken of current flows in the generator and
   in the external circuit, evidence suggests that electric charges are
   appearing at the periphery of the generator and disappearing at the
   center of the generator that do not actually pass through the
   generator. This experimental finding may explain why this
   configuration of electric generator experiences less mechanical drag
   than standard generator designs for each unit of electrical output
   produced. While energy is probably not being created or destroyed in
   the universal context, it is apparently appearing and disappearing
   from the machine during operation in the local space. This extra
   energy can be used to produce useful work in external circuits. Tewari
   has shown that twice as much hydrogen can be generated from an
   electrolysis cell run from the output of a SPG than if the cell is run
   directly. It is impossible to rationalize the behavior of this style
   of electric generator with the ideas of simple conversion and local
   conservation as they are postulated in the "First Law of
   Thermodynamics."

<p>In a standard generator, if all losses are ignored for the moment,
   conventional theory says if 550 Ft-Lbs of work are applied to the
   input shaft in one second, 746 Watts will be delivered at the output.
   If I blindly believe that the generator simply has the mysterious
   ability to convert the mechanical energy into electrical energy, I
   don't ask the following questions: what is the mechanism of this
   conversion?, where does the torque go?, and where does the electrical
   energy come from? The apparent observation that the generated current
   produces a motoring effect that opposes the input torque should not be
   interpreted as a vindication of the conservation rule, but as an
   admission that this is an inefficient way to generate electricity. The
   Space Power Generator experiences far less drag per unit of electrical
   output than a standard generator.

<p>This opens up a much larger discussion about the validity of the
   conversion idea all together. Are there actual and universal
   equivalents between the various forms of heat, mechanical work, and
   electricity? At this point, all we know for sure are the various
   measurements that have been taken from the devices that demonstrate
   these energy translations. For instance, in 1845, James Joule found
   that if he placed a small paddle wheel in a bucket of water, he had to
   apply 772.5 foot-pounds of mechanical work to spin the paddle wheel to
   raise the temperature of one pound of water, one degree Fahrenheit.
   This has led to very careful calculations that now set this "universal
   conversion" between mechanical work and heat at 778.26 FT-Lbs = 1 BTU.
   For paddle wheels in water, this is no doubt true. But what happens if
   paddle wheels are not used? Is there another method that does not use
   paddle wheels in water to convert mechanical work to heat that does
   the job better, with less expenditure of work for the same heat
   gained? The answer is yes. In fact, there are numerous patents on
   record to accomplish this. One uses rotating parallel disks, not
   unlike the design of Tesla's turbine, to heat water with less than
   half the mechanical expenditure.

<p>Once again, we have entered a new scientific era where the exact
   equivalence between mechanical work as foot-pounds, electrical work as
   watt-hours, and heat work as BTU's is not known! A wide variety of
   physical experiments have demonstrated a broad range of differing
   energy translation effects. The intellectual edifice of Clausius'
   conversion idea is crumbling, and no one should allow their thinking
   to be constrained by it any longer. The results of physical
   experiments have all but disproved it. The "First Law of
   Thermodynamics" should be seen only as an outmoded, intellectual MODEL
   that is not supported by all of the experimental data. Likewise, the
   idea of "over-unity" should be abandoned by those working on "free
   energy" systems as it is an intellectual contradiction based both on
   the belief in conversion and the ability to circumvent it.
   "Over-unity" is an oxymoron that should be removed from the vocabulary
   of the alternative science community.

<p>This brings me back to the other problem presented earlier, namely,
   the nature of heat itself. Is heat, as Hermann von Helmholtz suggests,
   simply the random motion of molecular matter, or is it something
   completely different, whose presence causes molecular matter to
   exhibit random motion? This is a very long and involved exploration
   that has already been handled masterfully by Rudolf Steiner in March
   of 1920 and published as his Warmth Course. I will summarize some of
   these ideas briefly.

<p>The ancient's believed that there were four "elements" that all
   physical reality was composed of. These were Earth, Water, Air and
   Fire. In modern language, we can restate this as follows. There are
   four "states" that all matter appears as. These are solid, liquid, gas
   and heat. From an etheric science point of view, heat is the fourth
   state of matter and the transition state between matter and ether.
   Here is why. The only difference between the appearance of ice, water,
   or steam, for example, is its temperature or internal heat condition.
   Heat is absolutely fundamental in all considerations regarding matter
   because a change in heat is the only element required to bring about a
   change of state from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas. In solid
   matter, the "atoms" are very close together and they bind each other
   in a way that allows them to hold their shape without being in a
   container. Heat can be added to the solid and its temperature will
   rise, correspondingly, until the melting point is reached. At this
   point, adding more heat does not raise its temperature, but rather
   causes the material to change state as the solid melts into a liquid.
   Once all of the material is liquified, adding more heat once again
   causes the temperature to rise. In liquid matter, the "atoms" are less
   close together and they bind each other in a way that allows the
   liquid to take the shape of whatever open topped container it is put
   in. As more heat is added to the liquid, the "atoms" move farther
   apart until the boiling point is reached. At this point, once again,
   adding more heat does not raise its temperature, but rather causes the
   material to change state as the liquid boils into a gas. Once all of
   the material is gaseous, adding more heat once again causes the
   temperature to rise. In gaseous matter, the "atoms" are so far apart
   that they will hold no shape at all and can only be contained by a
   complete enclosure. As more heat is added to the gas, the "atoms"
   become so dispersed that eventually, all that is left is the heat. The
   relationships between heat, temperature, matter and state are quite
   complex and cannot easily be reduced to simple explanations. Steiner's
   explorations of these relationships go into great detail, forming a
   seamless line of logic, backed up by a great deal of experimental
   data. Anyone interested in the nature of heat should study Rudolf
   Steiner's Warmth Course.

<p>While this may make no sense to people trained in mechanistic thought
   processes, it is much closer to the truth about heat than the ideas of
   Helmholtz, with which Steiner was completely familiar. Helmholtz's
   idea that the nature of heat can be fully described by the random
   motions of molecular matter is far too simplistic. It ignores many of
   the well known behaviors of heat and matter as well as the existence
   of the Etheric Energy Field. It should be considered an "interesting"
   historical attempt to describe heat that is not supported by all of
   the experimental data.

<p>For those who are not familiar with etheric science, it might be
   useful to review some of the characteristics of the Etheric Energy
   Field at this time. The Etheric Energy Field is made up of an
   extremely fine, mass-free fluid. Its activity can be divided into four
   main levels. These different aspects of the Ether have been called:
   the Warmth Ether, the Light Ether, the Tone (or Chemical) Ether, and
   the Life Ether. The Etheric Energy Field, as a whole, penetrates all
   matter, flows around and through the planet in well defined ways,
   exhibits elastic characteristics, and spontaneously moves from low
   concentrations to high concentrations before discharging.
   Understanding all of these factors has made engineering the weather a
   practical reality today. Many other amazing technologies also become
   possible when the ether is fully understood. Likewise, many aspects of
   today's science that are still confusing eventually become clear.

<p>One area of the greatest confusion lies in the field of electrical
   science. The entire study of what has been called "static electricity"
   is just a confusing encounter with the Light Ether as it behaves under
   certain circumstances. When fully understood, so-called "static
   electricity" will be seen to be neither static nor electricity. Normal
   electricity always flows from high potential to low potential and
   usually requires metallic conductors to flow along. On the other hand,
   "static electricity" does not discharge in the same way, and readily
   moves and collects on both conductors and insulators. Because "static
   electricity" behaves more like ether than electricity, I am going coin
   a term for this form of energy when it is present in wires and
   circuits. I call it "ETHERICITY", to distinguish it from electricity
   all together.

<p>In some ways, ethericity behaves like electricity and in some ways it
   behaves differently. This has been the source of confusion. Up until
   now, most people have thought that there was only one kind of energy
   moving in electrical style circuits. This can now change. Electric
   appliances are designed to run on the discharge of electric potential
   from high to low, as in the draining of a battery to power a load.
   Properly designed circuits employing ethericity run the appliance on
   the charging phase, as the energy spontaneously moves from low
   potential to high. Once the behaviors of ethericity are clearly
   understood, it will be just as easy to run motors and lights from this
   source as we now do on electricity. In the 1940's, Dr. Wilhelm Reich
   demonstrated both lighting and motoring effects running on the Etheric
   Energy Field that he tapped using his "orgone accumulators" and
   special circuitry. But many other ways have been discovered to harness
   ethericity. The patent office has many designs of so-called
   "electrostatic" motors on file that work quite well. They all run on
   ethericity, including some powered by circuits set up between the
   ground and a wire suspended high in the air. Many types of capacitors
   will spontaneously charge up on days with low relative humidity. This,
   too, is the classic appearance of ethericity. I have seen how an
   "electrostatic" generator failed to do anything, one humid morning,
   until the moment that sunlight fell on the metallic surfaces. It then
   jumped to life. This was one of the most convincing demonstrations I
   have ever seen that "static electricity" (ethericity) is related to
   light (the Light Ether).

<p>Here then are some of the known characteristics of ethericity that
   engineers and inventors should understand:

<l>Ethericity can be accumulated from the ground or the air at almost
   any location

<l>It can be "reflected" down wires (this is not conduction)

<l>Flows of ethericity can be interrupted by diodes and Mosfet type
   devices

<l>Its potential can be raised or lowered in air core transformers

<l>It can be stored in capacitors

<l>It will operate neon style lighting, when the potential is high
   enough

<l>It can create fields of opposing forces in coils and motor windings

<p>"Free energy" is here in the Etheric Energy Field. Etheric Energy can
   be accumulated without the expenditure of work, and then released in
   controlled ways to perform work, in properly engineered systems.
   Understanding this fact presents engineers and inventors the clearest
   and most direct path to follow. Systems that precipitate heat directly
   from the ether have already been demonstrated in Dr. Reich's
   accumulator. Placing one of these accumulators over a moving body of
   water increases the precipitation of heat dramatically. This is a rich
   vane of truth waiting to reveal its secrets to the systematic
   researcher. Likewise, power circuits that run on ethericity for
   lighting and motive power are waiting to be perfected.

<p>Researchers in the "free energy" field should not concern themselves
   with the ideas presented as the so-called "Laws of Thermodynamics".
   The "First Law", with its ideas of conversion and conservation, is
   essentially incorrect. There is no way to convert mechanical energy
   into etheric energy, actually make one into the other. This one
   example is enough to disprove the universal interpretation of the
   conversion idea all together. Beyond this, the energy forms that can
   be transmuted by the action of certain kinds of machines, apparently
   do so within a wide range of activity, depending on the geometry of
   the machine. This throws into question the idea of conservation,
   especially local conservation. These experimental findings render the
   "First Law" without any basis in fact. The real universe does not
   behave in accordance with these ideas.

<p>In the narrow case, the "Second Law" is really only a statement which
   describes the behavior of heat under certain circumstances. This much
   is basically true, as it is founded on experimental observation. In
   the general case, however, the "Second Law" is an intellectual
   extrapolation that does not accurately describe the behavior of
   physical reality under all circumstances. It embodies an erroneously
   concept of a mechanical universe which mysteriously burst forth (Big
   Bang) as a fully wound spring that has been unwinding ever since ("in
   a closed system, entropy does not decrease"). It is a lifeless, empty
   vision that ignores the Source of the energy it started with and
   closes the minds of its adherents to the solutions at hand.

<p>Learning how to tap the non-thermodynamic forces in nature is the hope
   of the future. A modern society needs light, heat, and motive power,
   all of which can be derived directly from the Etheric Energy Field
   without consuming limited physical resources owned by monopoly
   interests.

<p>In this society, theoretical science has been elevated to a very high
   level of prestige. Under this system of belief, the real needs of
   humanity have not been well served. It is time that these incorrect
   theories be carefully examined and discarded, so that experimental
   science can once again take the leading role in defining the nature of
   physical reality. Only then will Etheric Science be free to offer its
   bounty of solutions to a desperate and waiting world.
