<h>Moving Home

<p>Here a just a few tips on how to maximise the efficiency of using your
   packaging products for moving home.
<l>Try not to leave packing your removal boxes until the day of your
       home move. Ideally you want to have everything boxed up and ready
       to go as soon as your estate agent has called you to release your
       new keys. Packing your cardboard boxes with items that you don't
       use on a daily basis can be done as soon as you know that
       contracts have been exchanged.
<l>Get hold of good quality packaging products for moving home, in
       particular strong, cardboard boxes. Make sure you have a good
       selection of packing boxes in different sizes for the job in hand.
       You'll need medium sized cardboard boxes for small, heavy items
       such as books (if you fill a large box with heavy items it becomes
       too heavy to lift). Large removal boxes can be filled with
       lighter, bulky items. Bed linen and duvets are best packed in Tea
       Chest storage boxes. The best scenario for very large items such
       as television sets will be to use their original cardboard box. If
       you don't have this, use plenty of bubble wrap and make sure you
       tie up the cable to avoid tripping over it on the way to the van.
       Remember to tape the remote control to the inside of the packing
       box.
<l>Don't just throw your clothes in bin bags. Make life easier for
       yourself (and the removal people) by simply transferring your
       clothes to a Cardboard Wardrobe. This will keep your clothes clean
       and crease free during transit. In addition, the space at the
       bottom of the cardboard wardrobe is handy for storing shoes and
       handbags.
<l>Protect you mattresses with mattress covers. These thick, heavy
       duty plastic covers will prevent your mattresses getting scuffed
       or marked. Because of their size, mattresses are easily damaged.
       Packaging products such as mattress covers can also be used for
       covering sofas and chairs particularly if the weather is wet on
       your removal day. When you get to the other end, they can be
       either left on the mattress to prevent moisture damage or used as
       large rubbish bags.
<l>Wrap china, crockery and glass in acid free tissue paper. This
       will help prevent the dulling of your china and once sealed safely
       in a cardboard box, will protect it during your home removal.
<l>What about your best crystal or the bottles of wine in your rack?
       You'll need to keep these separated during transit to prevent them
       banging together and breaking. Special bottle boxes designed
       specifically with this in mind are available and come with
       dividers that separate each item. Adding tissue paper or bubble
       wrap to this equation will give you extra peace of mind during
       your removal.
<l>Make sure you have plenty of tape and a tape gun - absolutely
       essential for sealing cardboard boxes quickly and securely.

<h>Utilities

<p>Make sure that you have informed each of these utilities companies
   that you are moving home and if possible, see if you can get the
   account simply changed over rather than having them cut off. This will
   save your buyers having to pay re-connection charges once they move
   in.

<h>Services

<p>There may be many different companies that service your home and these
   will also need some action unless for instance you still want all of
   your post turning up at your old address.

<h>Before you leave (your old home)

<p>Moving house can be just as exciting as it is arduous and leaving a
   place clean and tidy with information about the services/area will
   help your buyers settle in a little easier. Below are some tips on how
   you can make their lives a little easier.
<l>Leave your house as you would hope to find it. We're not talking a
       full spring clean here but wiping ring marks from work surfaces,
       vacuuming up the dust from behind long-standing items after you've
       move them and giving the toilet a once-over goes such a long way
       to making people feel more comfortable with their new environment
       (remember they will have had a tough day of packing, lifting and
       travelling behind them already).
<l>Remember to empty your bins and write down the times and days of
       refuse recycling collections so that your buyers know when to
       leave theirs out.
<l>Leave out all the keys that relate to your property. The front
       door key goes without saying (as the agent will probably hold
       these) but keys for things such as sheds, greenhouses,
       outbuildings and more importantly, windows will need to be tagged
       so that your buyer knows which is which.
<l>Make sure that all of your utilities - Gas, Water, Electricity,
       are switched off (not cut off) and leave operating instructions
       for things such as the central heating, gas fires and boilers and
       locations for things such as Stop Cocks for Gas and Water and
       Mains Switches for Electricity.
<l>Also point out locations of utility meters and take meter
       readings, leaving copies for your new buyers so that there can be
       no dispute for any utility settlement.
<l>Do a quick check against your fixtures and fittings list (which
       your solicitor will have forwarded to you) to make sure you have
       left all that you said you would leave.
<l>You may wish to leave a forwarding address if you have chosen not
       to have your mail forwarded directly by the Post Office.

<h>When you arrive (at your new home)

<p>No doubt you will be fairly weary yourself once you arrive at your new
   home. No one says that you have to do everything the same day, after
   all you will probably be spending a fair amount of time getting the
   place just the way you want it. So, these pointers may help you move
   comfortably into your new home.
<l>Always, always put the beds up first because the last thing you'll
       want to be doing on the day of moving is put up your bed at
       midnight when you are already tired.
<l>Switch on all of your utilities (if your sellers are using these
       tips, they should all be off) and pay special attention to the hot
       water/boiler
<l>Familiarise yourself with the keys to your property and ALWAYS
       KEEP ONE ON YOU to avoid getting locked out (believe us, this does
       happen). Better still, arrange for a lock smith to change all of
       the locks at your property to give yourself added security.
<l>Keep pets inside if possible. Cats especially need to get used to
       their surroundings before they feel comfortable enough to venture
       outside.
<l>Find your utility meters and take readings. Send these off to the
       relevant company IMMEDIATELY so that you can start your new
       account and verify the readings that your sellers have potentially
       already given them.

<p>We can't guarantee a smooth ride every step of the way but follow
   these tips and they will go a long way to helping you avoid a lot of
   the hassle that moving can create.
