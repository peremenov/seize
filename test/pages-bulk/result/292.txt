<h>The Perfect Cup of Coffee

<p>Today coffee is a fashion accessory, and every self respecting
   follower of fashion should have their own Gaggia - or similar espresso
   machine as part of their home design.
<p>Coffee is an integral part of breakfast - it has replaced beer as the
   staple breakfast drink and the very sight of a coffee pot with its
   heady aroma of freshly brewed coffee makes the statement of good
   hospitality - enjoy.

<h>Ingredients

<p>There are a number of coffees to impress your breakfast guests.
<l>CAPPUCCINO - 1/3 strong coffee, 1/3 steamed milk, 1/3 frothy milk.
   Cappuccino is so named as it resembles the colour of the hooded robes
   of the Cappuccine monks in Italy.
<l>ESPRESSO - small cup of very strong coffee.
<l>CAFFE LATTE- double espresso topped up with steamed milk in a glass.
<l>CAFÉ CON PANNA -double espresso topped with a swirl of whipped cream.
<l>CAFÉ MOCHA -strong black coffee mixed with rich chocolate syrup,
   steamed milk topped with whipped cream & dusted with cocoa powder.
   note - Coffee picked in Mocha in the Yemen is rich and dark with a
   hint of chocolate in it's taste - hence 'mocha.'
<l>CAFÉ FRAPPE- (iced coffee) - chilled double espresso, whizzed with
   equal amounts of cold milk and two scoops of good coffee ice cream.
   A good tip is to make ice cubes out of the left over coffee. They will
   chill the drink without diluting it.
<l>DECAFFEINATED coffee is made from normal beans that are so soaked as
   to remove about 97% of the caffeine with only a little loss to the
   flavour.
<l>INSTANT COFFEE-Better to drink this than no coffee at all - but it's
   rather like settling for the house wine in a good restaurant rather
   than savouring the delights of the fine wine list.
<p>With Cafebars now a fashion item in the High Street, they have
   developed their own slang :
<l>'dry' - extra foam
<l>'harmless' - skinny and no fun
<l>'wet' - extra steamed milk
<l>'with wings' - take away
<l>'skinny' - fat free milk
<l>'wild' - whipped cream
<l>'no fun' - decaffeinated
<l>'no whip' - no whipped cream

<h>Recipe

<p>Start by visiting your coffee specialist store. Explain just how you
   like your coffee, mild, strong, rich, toasted, full bodied, (you see
   it really is as exciting as choosing that special bottle of wine).
   Then explain by what method you make the coffee. These are important
   facts. For example breakfast is best served by a blend of the strong
   rich coffees from Africa blended with the milder but fuller bodied
   coffee from central America or try a good cinnamon roasted coffee for
   breakfast.
<p>Now with the coffee at home, only grind enough beans for immediate
   use. Ground beans can be helped by keeping in the refrigerator in an
   air tight container to prevent the oil and volatile gases escaping.
   Try to use pure water. Bottled or purified in a Britta jug is best.
   For white coffee you should use a little cream or full fat milk. Semi-
   skimmed only dilutes the coffee. Never use UHT or synthetic 'creamer'
   - just try it on it's own !
<p>If you wish to sweeten the brew, use raw or rough brown sugar, white
   sugar will spoil some of the flavour. Try to drink coffee without
   sugar rather than add sweeteners.
<p>There are three main ways to make coffee. Firstly the basic jug
   orcafetiere where you add the water ((just off the boil) to a jug of
   freshly ground coffee. The second is the filter or drip method where
   the hot water filters and drips through a funnel filled with ground
   coffee. The third is the well known percolater.
