<h>It's Bill's Fault
<p>Bill Clinton may
   be to blame for a lot of things, but to imply that his ineptitude
   caused the tragic loss of life on September 11 is ludicrous at best
   and self-serving at worst.

<h>SAMPLE CHAIN LETTER TEXT

<h>Subject: Never Forget

<p>Some things the US citizens should never forget:

<p>After the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, which killed six and
   injured 1,000; President Clinton promised that those responsible would
   be hunted down and punished.

<p>After the 1995 bombing in Saudi Arabia, which killed five U.S.
   military personnel; Clinton promised that those responsible would be
   hunted down and punished.

<p>After the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia, which killed 19
   and injured 200 U.S. military personnel; Clinton promised that those
   responsible would be hunted down and punished.

<p>After the 1998 bombing of U.S. embassies in Africa, which killed 224
   and injured 5,000; Clinton promised that those responsible would be
   hunted down and punished.

<p>After the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole, which killed 17 and injured 39
   U.S. sailors; Clinton promised that those responsible would be hunted
   down and punished.

<p>Maybe if Clinton had kept his promise, an estimated 7,000 people in
   New York and Washington, D.C. that are now dead would be alive today.

<h>END CHAIN LETTER TEXT

<p>Later versions of this chain offered more bad news about Bill and
   Hilary and attributed the note to "a Navy man."

<h>AN INTERESTING QUESTION:

<p>This question was raised on a Philly radio call-in show. Without
   casting stones, it is a legitimate question.

<p>There are two men, both extremely wealthy. One develops relatively
   cheap software and gives billions of dollars to charity. The other
   sponsors terrorism.

<p>That being the case, why was it that the Clinton Administration spent
   more money chasing down Bill Gates over the past eight years than
   Osama bin Laden?

<p>It is a strange turn of events.

<p>Hillary gets $8 Million for her forthcoming memoir. Bill gets about
   $12 Million for his memoir yet to be written.

<p>This from two people who have spent the past 8 years being unable to
   recall anything about past events while under oath!

<p>A 2004 Presidential Election Year version of this chain changes the
   message from one of pure Clinton-bashing, to Bush-backing by adding
   the line "BUSH COVERED IT" after each of Clinton's alleged failures.
   It also updates the number of dead from 9/11 and adds a web site
   address, trying to legitimize the McWhorter attribution:

<p>We know that Commander McWhorter did not originate this chain, as his
   name was added more than a year after the first copies of it surfaced.
   It's possible that he wrote all or part of the added arguments, but
   it's just as likely that this is another case of False Attribution
   Syndrome, in which he became associated with it merely because he
   forwarded it and inadvertently added his identity to it.

<p>This chain intimates that after several significant terrorist attacks,
   President Bill Clinton promised justice would be done, but failed to
   deliver on those promises. The conclusion is drawn that, had Clinton
   been tougher on terrorists, the attacks of September 11, 2001, never
   would have happened. Post 9/11 investigations into intelligence
   breakdowns have indicated that both the Clinton and Bush
   administrations are guilty of ignoring warning signs of this tragedy
   and opportunities to stop it.

<p>The September 11 attacks were the result of many years of planning by
   various individuals and groups with an ages-old agenda to fulfill.
   Terrorism has been around for centuries and has survived decades upon
   decades of being "hunted down and punished." The mindsets of those who
   committed these crimes is deep-seeded in history. It's unlikely that
   they were significantly encouraged by one man's failure to retaliate.
   This chain letter's simplification of the attacks to a case of "bad
   parenting" practically excuses extremist terrorists as spoiled
   children whose misbehavior was not adequately corrected by a lax
   father.

<p>As a nation searches for justice for the most heinous act of cowardice
   ever committed on citizens, we are eager to pin the blame on anyone.
   But blaming the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks on Clinton is
   an insult to those innocent people who died - reducing their tragic
   deaths to just one more example of how inept Clinton was. What
   possible purpose does this chain serve except to deflect attention,
   hatred and blame from the real monsters behind this tragedy? And now,
   someone is using it to stump for Bush in an election year? Please,
   Break this chain!
