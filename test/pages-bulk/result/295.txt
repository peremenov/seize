<h>Dissertation Conventions

<p>This style-sheet contains advice about recommended conventions bearing
   on how to set out the dissertation and to refer to material in notes
   and the bibliography. These conventions must also be followed in your
   assessed essays, which you should use, inter alia, to practise
   presentational skills. Presentation and accuracy are important for
   more than stylistic reasons. Examiners will be concerned to scrutinise
   text layout, notes and bibliography in order to form an impression of
   your research technique.

<p>This cannot be a comprehensive guide. If you identify omissions or
   areas which need clarification, please report them to Robert Bickers
   so that they may be incorporated into later versions of this booklet.
   Your comments and suggestions will be very much appreciated.

<p>It is important to note that there is no universally accepted series
   of conventions. Most British academic presses (for example Oxford
   University Press (OUP), Cambridge University Press (CUP) and
   Blackwell) have their own idiosyncratic rules which cannot always be
   reconciled (and which they do not always manage to follow consistently
   from book to book). North American presses are generally more
   consistent in their conventions, but their annotation tends to be
   elaborate by British standards: for example, it is necessary to give
   the publisher of a book as well as the place of publication, and the
   authors' first names are given in full. So it is best not to follow
   American usage simply because it increases the amount of information
   which needs to be recorded and checked. Among the British presses,
   Blackwell stands out for the clarity and consistency of its annotation
   system. The recommendations below are substantially based on its
   practice. The point to emphasise is that you have some latitude in the
   choice of conventions: internal consistency within the dissertation is
   what matters above all else.

<h>Books

<p>In the bibliography books should be cited by their full title
   (including subtitle, if there is one, after a colon) together with
   place of publication and date. Thus:

<p>N.B. Underlined text may be used instead of italics, provided of
   course that your usage is wholly consistent. If you are able to use
   italics, they do look more professional.

<p>In the notes the first reference to a book should give its full title,
   place of publication and date, just as it appears in the Bibliography.
   Note, however, that the initials or given name now come before the
   surname. Thus:

<p>How does one establish what the title actually is? It sometimes
   happens that there are slightly different versions of the title in
   various parts of the book. Disregard the dust-jacket (if there is one,
   of course) and go by the internal title page. This is not the very
   first page, which usually has just the title on it, but the page which
   is overleaf. (It will usually have the author's name and the name of
   the press on it as well.) Follow what this title page says; the only
   addition which need be made routinely is supplying a colon to separate
   the title and the subtitle. Look out for minor variations. For
   example, there is sometimes a comma before the dates at the end of a
   title, sometimes not.
<l>Volumes with multiple authors:

<l>Edited volumes:

<p>After the first reference the title should be abbreviated. A good rule
   of thumb is that when abbreviating you should:
<l>Drop the definite or indefinite article if this is the first word
       of the title.
<l>Retain all the words up to and including the first noun.

<p>It is not uncommon that an author has produced several works with
   similar titles. If this is the case, expand the abbreviated reference
   until you reach the first noun which makes the title you mean
   unambiguous.

<p>Short titles are much better than using op. cit. ('the work
   mentioned'). This can be very confusing because it obliges the reader
   to trawl back through the earlier notes.

<p>Similarly, you should be very sparing in the use of ibid. ('the same
   work') when you find yourself having to refer to the same title in
   consecutive notes. Only do this when only one title is mentioned in
   both notes, so that there is no uncertainty about what the 'same work'
   refers to. If in doubt, do not use ibid. at all; simply repeat
   shortened titles.

<p>Avoid id./ead. ('the same male/female author'). Repeat the name.

<p>If a book is part of a series it is up to you whether to cite this.
   Generally speaking, it is not necessary to give series titles if they
   are not numbered: e.g. Oxford Historical Monographs. If the series is
   numbered, it can be an awkward decision where to include it without
   making the whole reference rather cumbersome. One technique is to tuck
   the series, not italicised, inside the brackets and separated from the
   place and date by means of a semicolon. Thus:

<p>When referring to a multi-volume single work, it is a good idea to
   give the volume number as a lower-case roman numeral. This prevents
   any confusion with page references. Thus:

<p>Note two things about this reference:
<l>the use of the semicolon to separate page numbers in the different
       volumes
<l>the use of a full point rather than a comma between the volume
       number and the first page extent - this looks better when there is
       a juxtaposition of lower-case roman numerals and arabic numerals.

<p>When abbreviating book titles, use acronym-type abbreviations very
   sparingly. Only do so if the title is referred to very often.

<p>To discover the place of publication of a book, use the internal title
   page and the page which gives details of, inter alia, the ISBN number.
   The place of publication is not necessarily the same as the place
   where the book was set and/or printed. If two or more places of
   publication are given, confine your reference to the first place
   mentioned: this applies even if one of the other places is in the UK.
   So, University of Chicago Press = Chicago and London = for our
   purposes Chicago. To avoid confusing Cambridge (USA), home of Harvard
   University Press, and Cambridge (UK), home of Cambridge University
   Press, the state in which Cambridge (USA) is located is added to the
   place of publication. Thus:

<h>The Harvard System

<p>There is another convention for bibliographies and notes which is
   sometimes known as the Harvard System. Here the title in the
   bibliography is listed in the form:  Hennessy, Peter. 1992. Never
   Again: Britain, 1946-51. London.  All references in the notes,
   including the first, then become: Hennessy 1992, 23-7.  If an author
   has produced more than one item in the same year, the works are
   distinguished by lower-case letters immediately after the date, with
   no spacing. Thus: Hennessy 1992a, 27.  It is also possible to insert
   Harvard System references into the body of the text, where you might
   otherwise use a footnote, placing the citation in brackets. For
   example:  ...Its flaws have become familiar (Bose 1990a, 36-8; Cooper
   et al. 1990, 1-9)... The advantage of the Harvard System is that it is
   very neat. The disadvantage is that it makes footnotes look rather
   bleak, or else it breaks up the text, and it obliges the reader to
   refer constantly to the bibliography, whereas with the normal method
   one tells the reader what the full title is and then provides constant
   reminders by means of abbreviated titles.

<h>Articles

<p>In the case of articles, it is the title of the journal which must be
   italicised/underlined. Thus in the notes:

<p>Note the position of the commas and the use of single inverted commas.
   Double inverted commas are reserved for quotation marks within the
   title: e.g.:

<p>Like book references the order of author surname/given name in the
   citation is different in bibliographies. The entry in the bibliography
   will read:

<p>When the title of a journal starts with the definite article, this is
   not reproduced. So English Historical Review, not The English
   Historical Review.

<p>For articles in edited collections:

<p>Abbreviated as:

<p>If there are two or more editors use (eds.).

<p>Some journals list the titles of their articles with no upper-case
   letters other than the beginning of the first word and, of course,
   proper nouns. Here you have a choice. Either scrupulously follow the
   conventions of each particular journal or standardise by having
   capital letters throughout. On balance, the second method is
   preferable because otherwise the notes can appear uneven.

<p>It is impossible to provide unambiguous rules about the use of
   capitals in titles. The general rule is that important words take a
   capital. You will not go far wrong if you use a capital for the
   following: nouns, adjectives, adverbs and most verbs.  The following
   do not take a capital:  conjunctions, prepositions, verbs expressing a
   state (esp. 'to be'), modal verbs (e.g. 'might', 'should', 'could'),
   pronouns, and the (in)definite article.  The first letter of the first
   word of a title is always a capital.

<h>Abbreviations

<p>Works referred to frequently may conveniently be cited by an
   abbreviation, provided a List of Abbreviations is included at the
   beginning of the dissertation. Thus:

<p>You will become familiar with the journals and series that crop up
   regularly in your chosen subject area: look at the List of
   Abbreviations in the books you use.

<p>Be fairly sparing with abbreviations. A good rule of thumb is that a
   journal may be abbreviated if you have references to three or more
   different articles appearing in it.

<p>One- or two-word journal titles should not be abbreviated. So,
   Contemporary History does not become CH, nor Albion A.

<p>You may also conveniently cite abbreviations for organisations
   referred to frequently in the text, provided that they are included in
   the List of Abbreviations. It is customary and helpful to name the
   organisation in full the first time it is referred to, and indicate
   the abbreviation to be used.

<p>'The Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) had had a police force since
     1854, and as over the years it had arrogated to itself more powers,
     and more land, so the Shanghai Municipal Police (SMP) had become a
     more and more important instrument of control.'

<h>Manuscripts and Archival Records

<p>Here conventions vary because of the wide variety of documentation
   preserved in many different places. Most archives will have guidelines
   available indicating the conventions they prefer, or will be able to
   tell you when you ask. You should also consult your supervisor about
   the most suitable conventions for the particular material you are
   studying.

<p>The general rule is that manuscript material is cited by city and
   location, with no underlining. Thus:

<p>The full description of the depository need only be given once, and a
   short title used thereafter:

<p>Where applicable, manuscripts are cited by folio number + r (for
   recto, the front - equivalent to an odd-numbered page in a book) or v
   (for verso, the back - equivalent to an even-numbered page). Thus:

<p>Interviews if conducted by the author are cited by name of
   interviewee, place and date of interview. Thus:

<p>Oral history references taken from existing collections are usually
   treated as manuscript material and may be cited according:

<h>World Wide Web

<p>Pages are cited thus:

<p>A comprehensive guide to such conventions can be found at:  Melvin E.
   Page, 'A brief citation guide for internet sources in history and the
   humanities' prepared for H-AFRICA Humanities On-Line, and History
   Department, East Tennessee State University. (Version 2.1) 20 February
   1996.

<h>Page Extents

<p>It is not necessary to preface page references with 'p.' or 'pp.',
   though you may do so. But when material is not conventionally
   paginated, you should draw attention to this by means of, for example,
   'col.'/'cols.' for column(s).

<p>Be precise in giving page extents. Avoid passim ('throughout the
   work'/'everywhere') because it looks lazy and leads the examiner to
   wonder whether you have read the work carefully. Similarly, avoid et
   seq. ('and what follows'). Equally unsatisfactory are 'f.' ('and the
   next few pages') and 'ff.' ('and the following pages') after a page
   reference.

<p>You should take care to provide meaningful page extents in your notes.
   One sometimes reads a sentence advancing a broad proposition which is
   supported by a reference to only one or two pages of secondary work.
   This is inadequate. You should refer to the whole run of pages where
   the point you are making is discussed. And you should try to refer to
   more than one work: important points made on the back of just one book
   or article look rather thin.

<p>When giving page extents some contraction is preferable. (But see
   below about roman numerals.) The general rule is that one counts from
   the units up through the tens, hundreds etc. until there is no
   repetition. Thus:

<p>There is one slight exception to this rule: page extents involving
   teens keep the tens figure.  Thus:

<p>This is easy to remember because page extents are written virtually as
   they are pronounced, and 'one hundred and thirteen-to-seven' is
   ridiculous.

<p>When referring to roman-numeral page extents (for example in an
   introduction or preface), use lower case: e.g. xxii-xxiv. Note that
   the arabic equivalent 22-24 should be expressed as 22-4 whereas roman
   numerals cannot be shortened; xxii-iv is impossible.

<h>Arrangement of the Bibliography

<p>The Bibliography should be split into either two or three parts
   depending on the types of primary material you have used:
<l>Primary Manuscript Sources
<l>Primary Printed Sources
<l>Secondary Works (note that the term 'Secondary Sources' is a
       solecism)

<p>Or:
<l>Primary Sources
<l>Secondary Works

<p>Primary sources are listed alphabetically by location.  Printed
   sources are also listed alphabetically.  The listing of secondary
   works is quite straightforward. Go alphabetically by author.

<p>When listing several works by one author, you should list them by
   date, starting with the first to be published.

<p>If a work is anonymous, or if one is dealing with a collection of
   sources where there is no imputed authorship (e.g. a collection of
   documents), it is listed alphabetically by the title. Ignore
   definite/indefinite articles. Thus Documents on British Foreign Policy
   would be listed under the letter D. And The Yi Ho Tuan Movement of
   1900 under the letter Y.

<h>Quotations

<p>Long quotations (two sentences or more) should be rendered as a block
   of text indented on both the left- and right-hand margins.

<p>The normal way to preface an indented quotation is with a colon.  No
   punctuation is used, however, if the quotation runs grammatically from
   the immediately preceding portion of text.

<p>Inverted commas are not used around indented quotations.

<p>With shorter quotations use SINGLE inverted commas. Double inverted
   commas are only used when a quotation appears within another. Thus:

<p>He first wrote, 'I heard the minister say "What!"'.

<h>Miscellaneous Points

<p>Different works are separated in notes by a semicolon.
   Romance-language (French, Spanish, Italian) titles seldom use capitals
   other than for the first word and proper nouns. If capitals are not
   used, they should not be supplied. Note that this advice is contrary
   to the conventions of the CUP and OUP, which insist that Romance
   titles take capitals up to and including the first noun; this system
   makes notes look lop-sided and should be avoided.  For spelling
   conventions (e.g. ise or ize, erred or ered) as well as for much else,
   you should consult The Oxford Writers' Dictionary, comp. R. E. Allen,
   which is widely available in paperback (Oxford Reference). This is an
   invaluable book. See also Fowler's Modern English Usage, ed. R. W.
   Burfield, another paperback in the Oxford Reference series.  Hart's
   Rules for Compositors and Readers at the University Press Oxford (39th
   edn.) is very useful too, but be warned that it uses OUP conventions
   which sometimes depart from what is recommended here.
<l>Be alert to the fact that some American university names are not
       the place of publication. Thus Yale = New Haven; Harvard =
       Cambridge, Mass.; Cornell = Ithaca, NY. But Princeton =
       Princeton.
<l>Do not rely solely on the spellcheck facility of your software. It
       can mangle proper nouns and more often than not uses American
       spellings. Beware also the auto-correct function: in the first
       draft of these guidelines EHR was routinely corrected to HER. 
<l>The superscript numbers of notes appear after the punctuation.
       Thus .1 ;2 ,3 and so on.
<l>Translations of foreign terms should be give in the text in
       brackets after their first appearance.
