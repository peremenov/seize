<h>Packaging

<h>Is the packaging used for soft drinks recyclable? 

<p>All packaging used by the soft drinks industry can be recycled and/or
   re-used to make other useful products. For example:

<l>aluminium cans are recycled and used with raw material to produce
       new batches of cans;
<l>plastic bottles can be used to make fleece textile products, fibre
       filling and street furniture;
<l>glass bottles can be reused or recycled to use in the production
       of new glass; and
<l>paper and board is recycled to produce tissue, paper bags, chip
       board, briefcases and office furniture.

<h>What do soft drinks companies do to reduce the amount of materials
   they use to contain their products? 

<p>The soft drinks industry is at the forefront of packaging innovations
   and is constantly looking at ways to reduce the amount of raw
   materials used in various types of packaging. This process of
   "lightweighting" means that not only are fewer materials being used,
   but savings are also being made in terms of the energy required for
   the manufacture and distribution of products. Today, the average can
   uses 35% less aluminium than 10 years ago, with steel cans containing
   50% less steel and average PET plastic bottles containing 25% less
   PET.

<h>What are the most popular types of packaging used to make soft drinks?
   
<p>The main forms of packaging used by the soft drinks industry are:

<l>glass bottles
<l>plastic including PET (Polyethylene terephthalate), PVC (Polyvinyl
       chloride), HDPE (High density polyethylene), cups (made from
       polystyrene and polyethylene), pouches (low density polyethylene)
<l>cans including aluminium and steel
<l>paper such as cartons

<h>Drinks come in many different types of packaging. Why are certain
   products packaged in some forms and not others? 

<p>When manufacturers are considering packaging for a soft drink they
   need to consider the functions of packaging to ensure that the
   products reach the consumer in the best possible condition. The
   functions of packaging are to contain, protect, identify and sell the
   product bearing in mind the impact upon the environment and the costs
   involved.

<p>Certain packaging is more suitable for certain types of product than
   others when you consider the above criteria. A summary of the various
   attributes and disadvantages of the main forms of packaging when
   looking at their functions is detailed here in PDF format.

<h>What have been the most important developments in terms of packaging
   for the soft drinks industry? 

<p>There have been many varied developments in terms of packaging ranging
   from lightweighting of different packaging, to the introduction of new
   materials. For example the glass bottle is the traditional soft drinks
   container. Originally this was heavy and bottle shape was limited.
   Improvements in glass bottle design resulted in the introduction of
   the lightweight glass bottle.

<p>Since then the industry has enjoyed the introduction of PVC and PET
   bottles, which enabled moulding of the bottles into various shapes,
   and the advent of the aseptic filled paper carton. In addition to this
   there has been the introduction of various closure systems to meet the
   needs of customers for the different forms of packaging.
