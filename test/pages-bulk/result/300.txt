<h>Strengthening Implementation of Corporate Social Responsibility in Global
Supply Chains

<p>Amidst the ongoing debate on how best to achieve good social and
   environmental practices in global supply chains, the World Bank Group
   commissioned a study on barriers to the achievement of better social
   and environmental performance in suppliers, and also on the options
   that hold the greatest promise for overcoming those barriers and
   enabling future improvement.

<p>Specifically, in the words of the Bank Group, the overall objective of
   the study is to "... contribute to a broader goal of removing
   unnecessary barriers to CSR compliance at the supplier level in global
   supply chains, enabling more suppliers to implement CSR standards more
   easily."

<p>The specific objectives of this study are to:
<l>Identify the key barriers to improved implementation of codes of
       conduct at the level of suppliers.
<l>Identify and prioritize viable options for addressing these
       barriers.

<h>Benchmark ReportRetail Recycling Project

<p>This benchmark report documents current practices by retailers and
   leading examples of shopping center recycling, including key factors
   that contribute to their leadership status. It also identifies
   conditions that can impede recycling at retail facilities. The
   information is based on a benchmarking survey and interviews with
   eight major retail companies representing more than 10,000 store
   locations in the U.S., and on interviews with property managers, waste
   haulers, and recycling experts. It provides leadership examples, as
   well as economic benefits that accrue to retail centers that implement
   recycling programs.

<h>Suppliers Perspective on Greening the Supply Chain

<p>Over the past several years, a number of organizations have
   investigated the increasing number of companies seeking to influence
   their suppliers' environmental practices, but typically have not
   looked at suppliers' perspectives on this trend. To address this
   imbalance and gain suppliers' insights into effective strategies for
   supply chain environmental management, BSR talked with representatives
   from 25 suppliers in four sectors -- automotive, electronics, forest
   products, and business services. This report, released in 2001 [PDF
   Document, File size: 135KB], summarizes their insights on:
<l>current trends in supply chain environmental management
<l>how these trends are impacting their business
<l>recommendations to suppliers on effective strategies for
       addressing environmental issues with suppliers
<l>whether and how these suppliers are addressing environmental
       issues with their suppliers
<l>future trends and directions
