   Just a trailer hitch receiver on the back of your vehicle with a
   Bumper Dumper®, and no more squatting in a bush, no more unstable,
   flimsy, rickety,under sized porta potty,and no more smelly unsanitary
   outhouses. Just plug the Bumper Dumper® into your hitch receiver and
   the comfort of home is there when nature calls.

<h>Have you ever been stuck in the middle of nowhere with no place to go?
<p>Has this happened to you? You're at the campsite or in the middle of
   nowhere and suddenly nature calls. What do you do? You squeamishly go
   looking for a quiet spot behind a bush to do your thing. You
   cautiously avoid the poison oak and ivy. As you carefully squat down
   and try to relax a snake suddenly comes slithering through the weeds
   and startles you. What a mess!
<p>Now when nature calls you can go in comfort where ever you are with
   the one and only Bumper Dumper®. No more looking for the right spot,
   no more trying to balance while squatting, and no more surprises from
   creepy critters. Just park your vehicle in a nice secluded spot, plug
   the Bumper Dumper® in to your trailer hitch receiver, and VOILA!! A
   portable toilet sturdy enough to hold 500 lbs. and just as comfortable
   as using the bathroom at home. You can even set up a privacy screen
   for complete comfort.


<h>Has this happened to you?
<p>You're driving on a long secluded stretch of road. You and the family
   had a big dinner at the last restaurant about an hour ago and
   someone's gotta go. "Can you hold it till the next stop", you ask. You
   drive a few miles and the sign says next station 90 miles ahead.
   Meanwhile, she tells you she needs to go too, but she can wait till
   the next stop. You keep driving a while and find yourself starting to
   feel the urge as well. By this time everyone is getting pretty
   anxious. You finally see the exit to the station and the brain kicks
   in. Everyone knows it's almost time for relief. You quickly exit and
   pull in to park. You get the restroom key from the attendant and hurry
   to open the door. 

<p>You open the door and see this!!!!

<h>Not Anymore!
<h>It's Super Sanitary

<p>At one time or another you'll wish you had a Bumper Dumper®.
<p>It's great on those long road trips. The Bumper Dumper® is light
   weight and stores easily. Now you have a safe and sanitary alternative
   to those road side nightmares. You can be assured of a sanitary place
   to go wherever you go. Take it hunting, fishing, camping, boating,
   vacation, on the job, in the field, or anywhere you may need to go.

<p>The Bumper Dumper® is great to have anywhere you go. No other portable
   toilet can compare to the support, stability and comfort that the
   Bumper Dumper® offers. The frame is made from quality steel and comes
   with a standard size toilet seat. It's the only portable toilet you
   can use your own seat on. Almost any standard size toilet seat can be
   mounted to the frame so you can attach a padded seat or the favorite
   seat of your choice. The Bumper Dumper® will last a long long time and
   it's light weight and so easy to use. If you have a trailer hitch
   receiver and travel or engage in outdoor activities where restrooms
   are far and few in between the Bumper Dumper® is a must have item.
<p>Makes a great gift too. 

<p>When traveling just pull off to a secluded spot and plug the Bumper
   Dumper® into the hitch receiver. No more having to wait for the next
   unsanitary rest area.

<p>Use the Bumper Dumper® when you need to
                               go on the go.
