<h>Bed, Bath & Beyond Inc

<p>Bed Bath & Beyond has everything you need to play "house" for real.
   It's the #1 superstore domestics retailer in the US (ahead of #2
   Linens 'n Things), with nearly 700 stores in 44 states and Puerto
   Rico. The stores' floor-to-ceiling shelves stock better-quality
   (brand-name and private-label) goods in two main categories: domestics
   (bed linens, bathroom and kitchen items) and home furnishings
   (cookware and cutlery, small household appliances, picture frames, and
   more). Everyday low prices eliminate the need for sales. Bed Bath &
   Beyond relies exclusively on circulars, mailings, and word-of-mouth
   for advertising.
