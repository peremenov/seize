<h>Special Arrangements for candidates with visual difficulties

<p>Visual difficulties may range from a minor condition to total
   blindness, and Cambridge ESOL can supply enlarged and modified
   question papers for less serious difficulties, or brailled and
   modified question papers where these are required.

<h>Exams

<p>If you have visual difficulties, you can ask for Special Arrangements
   to be made so that you can take the following exams:
<l>Key English Test (KET)
<l>Preliminary English Test (PET)
<l>First Certificate in English (FCE)
<l>Certificate in Advanced English (CAE)
<l>Certificate of Proficiency in English (CPE)
<l>Business English Certificates (BEC)
<l>International English Testing System (IELTS)
<l>Young Learners English (YLE)
<l>Certificates in English Language Skills (CELS)
<l>Certificates in ESOL Skills for Life

<p>Applications for Special Arrangements for other ESOL examinations not
   listed above may be possible.

<h>How to apply for Special Arrangements

<p>You must apply through your centre as soon as possible. In the case of
   IELTS you must apply through your IELTS centre.

<p>Please check the latest dates for application which vary according to
   the exam and are usually several months before the exam. Your centre
   will tell you when you must apply.

<p>The centre will ask for full details of your particular visual
   difficulty, and make all the necessary special arrangements for you to
   take the exam.

<p>You may be asked to provide a medical certificate.

<p>Please read through the following sections carefully, and make sure
   that you ask for all the necessary arrangements to be made.

<p>See also the Important notes section below.

<h>What Special Arrangements you can request

<h>Extra Time

<p>If you have visual difficulties, you will almost certainly need extra
   time to complete a paper. You may ask for an extra 25% of the normal
   time allowed for a paper.

<p>You may ask for more than 25% extra time. This might be necessary if,
   for example, it takes you a long time to read the questions or record
   your answers.

<p>Remember, however, that too much extra time may make you very tired.

<p>You will also be allowed to have breaks whilst taking a paper, in
   addition to any extra time you need. Ask your centre to tell you what
   you will be allowed.

<h>Reading the question papers in a different way

<p>If you are partially sighted you may use the following equipment:
<l>magnifying glass
<l>closed-circuit television (CCTV)
<l>hand-held scanning apparatus.

<p>You may ask a 'reader' to read and re-read questions to you (but see
   the Important notes section below).

<h>Writing your answers in a different way

<p>If you wish, you may record your answers in the following ways:
<l>you may use your Braille machine
<l>you may use your Braille machine, linked to a printer
<l>you may use a typewriter or word-processor. If you want to use a
       word-processor, it must not have a spellcheck or thesaurus
       facility
<l>you may dictate your answers to an amanuensis (see the Important
       notes section below).

<h>Braille question papers

<p>Braille versions of KET, PET, FCE, CAE, CPE, BEC, CELS and IELTS
   (certain papers only) can normally be made available.

<p>Please tell us whether you need your papers in contracted or
   uncontracted Braille.

<p>Please note:
<l>the supervisor will also have a print version of each Braille
       paper
<l>in some papers we arrange for the texts and the questions to be
       brailled in separate booklets.

<p>We can send you past exam papers in Braille as practice material.
   Please ask us in good time, if you would like us to send you some past
   papers. Contact the ESOL Special Circumstances Unit (see the Further
   information section below).

<h>Enlarged Question Papers

<p>You can ask for two different kinds of enlarged question paper.

<h>Type 1:
<p>We enlarge the standard question paper making no changes to the layout
   or material. You will receive A3 size question papers.
   (Usually 15.5 point)

<h>Type 2:
<p>We change the question papers, removing 'visual' material which is not
   essential for answering the question. We then make large-print
   versions of the papers in A4 size.
   (Usually 18 point bold)

<p>Note that we can also supply reduced print question papers.

<h>Listening Tests

<p>We make special arrangements for these tests.

<p>Many of the questions in the listening tests ask candidates to make
   notes while they listen to a tape. If you are blind or have visual
   difficulties you may not be able to do this.
   We produce a special version of the listening test.

<p>You will hear the same material and answer the same questions as other
   candidates.

<p>However, the supervisor will:
<l>stop the tape before each part of the test to allow you enough
       time to read the questions
<l>stop the tape at certain points during each part to allow you
       enough time to write one or more answers
<l>stop the tape after each part to allow you enough time to check
       your answers.

<p>You should note that when the tape is paused during a part, you:
<l>may not need to write an answer at all.
<l>may need to write more than one answer.

<h>Speaking Tests

<p>For KET, PET, FCE, CAE, BEC or CELS, you must normally take the
   speaking test with a partner.

<p>If you have visual difficulties, you can apply to:
<l>have extra time if it takes you longer than usual to read any exam
       material or decide what you want to say
<l>take the test with a partner who is not taking the examination
<l>take the test without a partner (i.e. in the parts of the test
       which usually ask both candidates to talk to each other, you talk
       to the examiner instead). (Please note that this option is not
       available for BEC or CELS.)
<l>use adapted visual material (see below).

<p>Parts of the speaking test for some exams are visual - they use
   pictures taken from newspapers or magazines, for example.

<p>If you are partially sighted we can supply enlarged copies of these
   pictures. If you find it difficult to use enlarged pictures we can
   supply enlarged print versions of written descriptions of the
   photographs. Talk to your centre about which would be best for you.

<p>We can also supply material in Braille for blind candidates.

<p>For example, in the Braille version of the FCE Speaking Test:
<l>the examiner will spend a few minutes asking you to talk about
       yourself
<l>you will then be given short written descriptions of two
       photographs in Braille. The examiner will ask you to compare and
       contrast the situations in the descriptions and give your opinion
       about them. You will have about a minute to do this
<l>finally you will be asked to take part in various conversational
       activities using brailled notes or information.

<h>Having a 'reader' or an amanuensis.

<p>A reader is a person who will read the questions out to you. Note that
   the reader will not explain the questions to you or offer any advice.
   A reader is not usually allowed to read out the texts in a Reading
   Test.

<p>An amanuensis is a person who will write down your answers. If you
   would like an amanuensis to write down your answers, you should note
   that:
<l>you will be asked to spell certain words
<l>you must also indicate punctuation.

<p>The amanuensis will also read your answers back to you if you wish.

<p>Please contact your centre if you would like to know more about having
   a reader or an amanuensis.

<p>We recommend that you practise with a reader/amanuensis before the
   examination. For example, you should make sure that you can spell out
   the letters of the alphabet.

<h>Important notes
<l>Please note that it may not always be possible for a Braille
       version of a particular examination to be prepared.
<l>British Standard Braille is moving over towards the optional use
       of capital letters. Skills for Life Level 1 & 2 Reading may
       specifically test the use of capitals. Capitals will therefore be
       included in Braille versions of Skills for Life Reading in those
       tasks which test their use, and candidates who are preparing to
       take a Braille version of Skills for Life should be made aware of
       this. Capitals will not be included in texts or questions for
       other tasks for the time being.
<l>Cambridge ESOL reserves the right not to approve applications for
       Special Arrangements. No application will be considered unless it
       has the unreserved support of the centre.
