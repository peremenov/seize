<h>Addressing

<h>Table of Contents

<h>Overview

<p>Canada Posts computerized systems can decipher a wide range of
   addressing styles - from handwritten notation to typed and printed
   labels, but studies show that a consistent approach to mail addressing
   leads to more efficient handling. For Canada Posts Customers, large
   and small, this translates into better service and lower costs.
   Consistent and accurate addressing eliminates the need for extra
   handling or redelivery by Canada Post. Standardized addressing ensures
   that mail is consistently delivered on time, the first time, every
   time.

<p>The guidelines in this chapter promote the most technologically
   efficient formats for addressing. It does not limit mailers to any one
   format. In some cases, because of individual preference or other
   considerations, mailers may not be able to follow the formats that
   this Guide presents.

<p>For more technical information on the physical characteristics
   necessary for effective processing by Canada Posts automated systems,
   Go to Canadian Postal Standards.

<h>General Information

<h>Addressing Guidelines
<p>Addresses should be written in upper case; however, mailers may
       wish to use lower case due to individual preference or other
       considerations.
<p>Postal codes should be printed in upper case with the first three
       elements separated from the last three by one space (no hyphens).
       If the postal code is not formatted in this manner, the mail may
       be delayed.
<p>The municipality, province or territory, and postal code should
       always appear on the same line. There should be one space between
       the municipality, province or territory and two spaces between the
       province or territory and postal code.
<p>Characters in the address block should not be underlined.
<p>Punctuation should not be used unless it is part of a proper name,
       (ST. JOHN'S). However, mailers may wish to use punctuation due to
       individual preference or other considerations.
<p>Accents may be used as they are an integral part of language but
       they are not considered to be punctuation.
<p>The # symbol should never be used, nor the French equivalent no as
       part of the address.
<p>All lines of an address should be formatted with a uniform left
       margin and should be less than 40 characters per line, excluding
       spaces.
<p>Space between address lines should be at least 0.5 mm but no more
       than one blank line between lines of addressing.
<p>All characters should be larger than 2 mm and smaller than 5 mm
       from the top to bottom (10 to 12-point). Return addresses may use
       smaller characters and should not be larger than the destination
       address.
<p>Only non-proportional fonts (characters which occupy the same
       width) should be used. The following are examples of acceptable
       fonts: OCR B, Letter Gothic, Elite, Lotus Line-Draw, MS Line Draw,
       Courier, Courier New, Pica and Copy Pica.
<p>Return addresses should be formatted in the same fashion as the
       destination address, and located in the top-left corner of the
       mail piece, clearly separated from the destination address, or on
       the back of the mail piece at the top. The return address is
       mandatory on Priority Courier, Xpresspost, Expedited Parcel and
       Regular Parcel items.

<h>Illustrations

<p>The following examples illustrate Canada Post's recommended addressing
   guidelines.

<h>Civic Addresses (Street Addresses)

<p>Additional delivery information is optional data that a mailer
       wishes to include. (title, floor, etc.) It is always placed above
       the civic address.
<p>A unit number is placed before the civic number with a hyphen
       between, OR after the street type, using an acceptable unit
       identifier (ex. APT 10). Please see Unit Designators for a list.
       The unit information may be placed on the line above the street
       information if space is an issue.
<p>The civic number is the official number assigned to an address by
       the municipality.
<p>When a civic number suffix is present, there is no space when it
       is alpha (123A), and there is one space when it is a fraction (123
       1/2).
<p>The street name is the official name recognized by each
       municipality and should not be translated. (Ex.: Main is not
       Principale.) There is no space between a numerical street name
       with an ordinal or an alphanumeric character. (Ex.: 2ND ST or 36A
       ST). When the street name is numeric, there is only one space (no
       hyphen) between the civic number and the street name. (Ex.: 123
       22ND AVE).
<p>The street type is provided by the municipality. Common
       abbreviations should be used. Please see Street Types below for a
       complete list. In some instances, the street type is also the
       street name (THE PARKWAY). The only street types that may be
       translated are:
<p>A French street type is placed before the street name, unless it
       is an ordinal number (1re, 2e, PREMIÈRE, DEUXIÈME, etc.)
<p>The street direction uses the common one- or two-letter
       abbreviation. Please see Street Directions for a complete list.
<p>The official municipality name, as provided to Canada Post, the
       official abbreviation of the municipality, or an official
       alternate name, should be used and should not be translated. (Ex.:
       TROIS-RIVIÈRES is not THREE RIVERS.)
<p>The province should always be presented using the recognized
       two-letter symbol. Please see Province and Territory Symbols below
       for a complete listing. Mailers may wish to have the province
       written in full and placed in brackets. Ex.: (Québec)
<p>The postal code should be in upper case and placed two spaces to
       the right of the province with one space between the first three
       and last three characters.

<h>Post Office Box Addresses

<p>Additional delivery information is optional data that a mailer
       wishes to include. (title, floor, municipal address, etc.) It is
       always placed above the post office box address.
<p>The post office box number should always be placed on the line
       just above the municipality, province and postal code. The #
       symbol should not be used, nor the French equivalent n^ o.
       Punctuation should not be used.
<p>Station information should be present to direct mail to the proper
       postal installation when there is more than one installation
       within a municipality.
<p>The official municipality name, as provided to Canada Post, the
       official abbreviation of the municipality, or an official
       alternate name, must should be used and cannot should not be
       translated. (Ex.: TROIS-RIVIÈRES is not THREE RIVERS.)

<p>The postal code should be in upper case and placed two spaces to
       the right of the province with one space between the first three
       and last three characters.

<h>Rural Route Addresses

<p>Many rural areas now have civic addresses. Civic addresses may be
       added above the rural route. In some locations, the rural route
       (RR) designator is no longer required.
<p>Additional address information is often required for delivery to
       this type of address. Some examples include: SITE/ COMPARTMENT,
       LOT/CONCESSION, civic address, attention line, title, floor. The
       word BOX should not be used in place of COMPARTMENT.
<p>The rural route identifier should use the two-letter symbol (RR,
       SS, MR), followed by the number, one space to the right. The #
       symbol should not be used, nor the French equivalent, n^ o.
       Punctuation should not be used in RR, SS, or MR.
<p>Station information should be present to direct mail to the proper
       postal installation when there is more than one installation
       within a municipality.

                           Station              = STN

       abbreviation "GD." Punctuation should not be used.
<p>Station information should be present to direct mail to the proper
       postal installation when there is more than one installation
       within a municipality.

                           Station              = STN
                           Retail Postal Outlet = RPO
<p>The official municipality name, as provided to Canada Post, the
       official abbreviation of the municipality, or an official
       alternate name, should be used and should not be translated. (Ex.:
       TROIS-RIVIÈRES is not THREE RIVERS.)

       and last three characters.

<h>Bilingual Addresses

<l>A solid black line must be placed between the two addresses. It
       must be a minimum of 0.7 mm thick.
<p>There must be a clear space on each side of the black line. This
       clear space should be approximately 10 mm.

<h>Military Addresses

<p>Military addressing is defined as mail sent to or by the Department of
   National Defense, Canadian Forces personnel, their dependents and
   civilians attached to Canadian Forces served through Canadian Forces
   Post Offices and Fleet Mail Offices. Go to Section E - Chapter 12,
   Canadian Forces Mail.

<h>United States of America Addresses

<p>Addressing elements required by the United States Postal Service
   should be prepared according to the United States postal standards.

<l>All U.S.A. mail items must be addressed to a specific individual,
       organization or company name.
<l>The full municipality name should be used and should appear as the
       first component in the second last line of the address block.
<l>The two-letter state symbol is preferred over the full state name.
       The state symbol should appear on the second last line of the
       address following the municipality, separated by one space. Please
       see United States of America - States, Territories and Possessions
       below for a complete listing.
<l>The ZIP code must be separated from the state symbol by two
       spaces. It may be either five or nine digits. If the nine-digit
       format is used, a hyphen will be used to separate the fifth and
       sixth digits.
<l>The country name should appear alone on the last line of the
       address block.

<h>International Addresses

<p>All international mail items must be addressed to a specific
   individual, organization or company name. Also, to ensure proper
   processing, the country name should be spelled correctly and in full.
   (Ex.: UAE is not acceptable for UNITED ARAB EMIRATES. Go to Section H,
   International Destination Listing, for a complete listing and correct
   spelling of countries.

<p>The name of the country should be the last entry on the address. It is
   placed at the bottom, below the municipality/city name and any postal
   code/zip code information.)
<p>Canada Post encourages all mailers to respect the wishes of Customers
   in matters of format. These guidelines have taken care to accommodate
   the requirements of the English and French languages by recognizing
   and accepting the use of upper- and lower- case characters, including
   accents, as well as the full spelling of and punctuation between
   addressing elements.

<h>Unit Designators

<p>The following are the most technologically efficient unit designators.
   In some cases, because of individual preference or other
   considerations, a mailer may use other unit designators.

<h>Canadian Provinces and Territories

<h>States, Territories and Possessions - United States of America

<h>Postal Code

<p>The postal code is an integral part of every postal address in Canada.
   The postal code was designed to aid in sorting mail by both mechanized
   and manual methods. It also enables the Customer to presort mail,
   thereby bypassing a number of sorting processes within Canada Post and
   reducing costs.

<h>The Structure of the Postal Code

<p>The postal code is a six-character uniformly structured, alphanumeric
   code in the form ANA NAN where A represents an alphabetic character
   and N represents a numeric character. A postal code is made up of two
   segments: forward sortation area and local delivery unit.

<p>The forward sortation area is a combination of three characters
   (alpha-numeric-alpha). It identifies a major geographic area in an
   urban or a rural location.

<p>The local delivery unit is a combination of three characters
   (numeric-alpha-numeric). It identifies the smallest delivery unit
   within a forward sortation area.

<h>Forward Sortation Area - The First Segment of the Postal Code

<p>The forward sortation area or FSA represents a specific area within a
   major geographic region or province. The forward sortation area
   provides the basis for the primary sorting of forward mail.

<p>The first character of the forward sortation area segment identifies
   one of the 18 major geographic areas, provinces or districts:

<p>The second character of the forward sortation area is an important
   component of mail preparation as it identifies either:
<l>an urban postal code: numerals 1 to 9 (E2J). Urban postal codes
       are generally serviced by Letter Carrier or community mailboxes;
       or
<l>a rural postal code: numeral 0 (zero) (A0A). Rural postal codes
       are serviced by rural route drivers and/or postal outlets.

<p>The third character of the forward sortation area segment (E2J) in
   conjunction with the first two characters, describes an exact area of
   a city or town or other geographic area.

<h>Local Delivery Unit - The Second Segment of the Postal Code

<p>The local delivery unit or LDU, identified by the last three
   characters of the postal code, allows for a more final sort within a
   forward sortation area.

<p>In urban areas, the last three characters may indicate a specific city
   block (one side of a street between two intersecting streets), a
   single building or, in some cases, a large-volume mail receiver.

<p>In rural areas, the last three characters, together with the forward
   sortation area, identify a specific rural community.

<h>Postal Code Address Data

<p>Canada Posts postal code address data is used to determine or verify
   the correct postal code for an address anywhere in Canada or identify
   the complete range of addresses that correspond to any one postal
   code. The data is available by download from a secured Canada Post FTP
   site, on CD-ROM or IBM cartridge, and is updated and distributed
   monthly.

<p>Delivery Mode data, Householder and Householder-Plus data are also
   available. Additional information on postal code data is available at
   : www.canadapost.ca/offerings/address_management/can/other_data-e.asp.

<h>Canadian Postal Code Searching Tools

<p>The Canadian Postal Code Directory© contains postal code information
   for all addresses in Canada. It facilitates postal code lookup and
   verification.

<p>The Canadian Postal Code Directory can be purchased in hard copy
   through the National Philatelic Centre at 1-800-565-4362, or at
   selected postal outlets.

<p>Free postal code lookup is available to Customers through Canada Posts
   website at: « www.canadapost.ca/tools/pcl/bin/advanced-e.asp ».

<p>Postal codes can also be obtained by calling 1-900-565-2633 for
   service in English or 1-900-565-2634 for service in French.

<h>Address Accuracy Program

<p>Address Accuracy is a program designed to improve delivery by
   encouraging Customers to accurately address mail. Every item must be
   addressed to a specific individual or company. In the case of
   Addressed Admail and Catalogue Mail, items may also be addressed to a
   non-personalized descriptor, such as "Occupant" or similar wording.
   Every item must display a complete mailing address including any
   required suite or unit information as well as the valid postal code
   for that address. If the mailing address is not complete, the mail may
   be delayed or returned.

<p>Consistent and accurate addressing eliminates the need for extra
   handling and/or redelivery. For Customers, this translates into a more
   efficient service and lower costs. Accurate addressing helps ensure
   the mail is delivered on time, every time.

<p>Participation in the Address Accuracy Program is mandatory for all
   Machineable, Letter Carrier Presort (LCP), and NDG Presort mailings
   greater than 5,000 items.

<p>The standard for Address Accuracy is 95%. This means that 95% of the
   addresses on the Customer's database are determined to be valid. This
   is done by using a Canada Post recognized address validation and/or
   address validation and correction software. If the percentage on the
   Statement of Accuracy (SOA) produced by the software is less than 95%,
   an adjustment will be applied to the mailing.

<p>Customers must record their Address Accuracy percentage and expiry
   date obtained from their Statement of Accuracy (SOA) on their Order
   (Statement of Mailing). Failure to record the Address Accuracy
   percentage and expiry date on the Order (Statement of Mailing) will
   result in the application of a surcharge.

<p>Customers are requested to keep a valid copy of the Statement of
   Accuracy (SOA) on file in the event that Canada Post requests a copy.

<p>In the case of Incentive Lettermail, Address Accuracy applies to Low
   Density Presort and Machineable mailings greater than 5,000 items, as
   well as to High Density Presort mailings greater than 500 items
   deposited in a Letter Carrier office. Customers who deposit Short and
   Long (S/L) High Density Presort mail in non-letter carrier offices
   (not serviced by letter carriers) for delivery within that same
   office, are exempt from the Address Accuracy requirements. All other
   requirements to access the High Density Presort service option must be
   adhered to.

<p>More information on the Address Accuracy Program can be found in the
   Address Accuracy Program Customer Guide, on the Canada Post website at
   www.canadapost.ca/address_management or from a Canada Post
   Representative.

<h>Address Validation, Address Correction and Postal Code Look-Up

<p>Canada Post recognizes several software packages that provide mailers
   with automated means to perform address validation, address correction
   and postal code lookup.
