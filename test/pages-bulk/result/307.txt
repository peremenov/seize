<h>Liberals table same-sex marriage bill despite protests, opposition

<p>CANADIAN justice minister Irwin Cotler tabled legislation to allow
                              same-sex marriage
                      in the House of Commons Tuesday.

<p>If passed, BillC-38
   would redefine marriage as a "union between two persons." As a result,
           consequential amendments would also have to be made to
   the Canada Business Corporations Act, the Civilian War-related Benefits
                Act, theDivorce Act and the Income Tax Act.

<p>"What will be the social effects of refashioning a fundamental
     social institution -- to marriage itself, to spouses, children and
            society?"responded Bruce Clemenger, president of the
                      Evangelical Fellowship of Canada
      (EFC). "It is a sad day when the language ofhusband and wife is
   removed from federal legislation. Is this whatCanadians want? It is a
        distorted notion of tolerance and respect thateclipses this
                         distinctive relationship."

<p>If the bill is passed, the Liberal government would not use
          the Constitution's notwithstanding clause to preserve the
    current definition of marriage, as between two people of the opposite
    sex. The notwithstanding clause allows the government to create laws
   that will operate in spite of some Charter rights that the laws appear
   to violate. Though these declarations last only five years, they can be
                          re-enacted indefinitely.

<p>Focus on the Family Canada president Terence Rolston said "there will be
      consequences" if the legislation goesthrough. "If passed, [this]
     experiment will be on the backs of ourchildren," he said. "But God
      puts our governments into power and he is sovereign over them. I
   believe in the power of prayer. Now's the time for Canadian voices to be
                     heard in the democratic process."

<p>Foreign affairs minister Pierre Pettigrew has said that churches
    and other faith-based organizations should not intervene in matters of
    government and that Canadians need to "distinguish between civil and
                            religious marriage."

<p>Responding to Pettigrew's remarks, Rolston said, "How marriage
     is recognized is important as to how society values the institution
   of marriage. The law should underline and support the institution that
                      Godordained. It is a covenant."

<p>Janet Epp Buckingham, director of law and public policy at EFC,
      said more than 75 percent of marriages in Canada are performed by
                                  clergy.

<p>"It is clearly a deeply religious constitution," she explains. "It
      is naive and impossible to say that you can change civil marriage
       without it having an impact on religious marriage and religious
                               institutions."

<p>Gilles Marchildon, executive director of Egale Canada, a gay
   and lesbian rights group, said it is a "dangerous blurring of the lines"
    between church and state "when any faith wants its view of the world
     and its view for its own institutions imposed on society at large."

<p>But Rolston disagreed. "This is one of the most significant issues
       to hit the government in the past 30 years. We do live in a free
   and democratic country. We have the opportunity to vote and be involved
   in the democratic process. We shouldn't neglect the freedom of speaking
      out here for the truth of God's word, proclaiming it to those in
                                authority."

<p>Bill C-38 does state that "officials of religious groups are free
       torefuse to perform marriages that are not in accordance with
    their religious beliefs." However, since only provincial governments
     have the authority to legislate protection of religious freedom to
       the solemnization of marriage, Buckingham said this issue is "a
     political football" being tossed between the federal and provincial
                                governments.

<p>"We have not seen any action by the provincial governments to
        protect religious freedom," she says. "Churches and religious
           institutions are being set up for endless court cases."

<p>The Vancouver Chinese Evangelical Ministerial Fellowship,
       representing 95 Chinese Christian churches that includes 25,000
      individuals, released a declaration opposing the bill January 28.

<p>The declaration stated that "changing the tradition of marriage in
       the manner proposed by the Federal Government goes against the
   intention of God's creation and it runs counter to the moral traditions
    deeply held by Chinese and people from other ethnic backgrounds . . .
   the government has no right to ignore the will of the people in order to
                          be politically correct."
