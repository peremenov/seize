<h>World Issues: Will Washington Tolerate A Chinese-Venezuelan Petro Pact?

<h>The U.S.-Venezuela Oil Split Approaches A Boiling Point

<p>Although Venezuela has long been one of the U.S.s top four foreign
   suppliers of crude, relations between the two countries have grown
   quite acrimonious since the Bush administrations tacit support of the
   failed coup against populist president Hugo Chavez in April of 2002.
   How the Bush administration has been dealing with Caracas repeats a
   well-known cycle to any student of U.S./Latin American relations:
   support of overt or covert coups against democratically-elected
   regimes eventually ignites a backlash of popular support for the
   embattled government against the imperialist gringos. This is likely
   to motivate Washington to even more aggressively back its favored
   opposition, generating an even stronger wave of popular backlash.

<p>The crucial difference between the recent U.S. support of the
   middle-class opposition in Venezuela mainly through the National
   Endowment for Democracy (NED) and the U.S. Agency for International
   Aid (USAID) versus its earlier backing of the Somoza, Batista,
   Duvalier and Pinochet dictatorships, is that Washington can ill afford
   to antagonize the populist government from which it receives anywhere
   between 11% and 15% of its imported petroleum. This is one situation
   where Washington simply cannot risk an oil crisis for the sake of
   indulging the administrations numerous nostalgic cold warriors, like
   Assistant Secretary of State Roger Noriega and Undersecretary of State
   John Bolton. But despite the Bush administrations tacit support of the
   2002 coup and the substantial funds that the NED poured into the
   failed recall referendum last August, Chavez has, so far, not given
   any indication that he intends to cut petroleum exports to the U.S. He
   did, however, tell Washington to not "even think about trying
   something similar in Venezuela," referring to what he claims was
   Washingtons orchestrated coup against former Haitian President
   Jean-Bertrand Aristide in February, 2004. Should the U.S. follow this
   course, he optimistically observed that Venezuela has enough allies on
   this continent to start a 100-year war," and that "U.S. citizens could
   forget about ever getting Venezuelan oil."

<h>Enter the Dragon
<p>In December 2004, President Chavez met with his Chinese counterpart,
   Hu Jintao, in Beijing to discuss a new bilateral agreement regarding
   access to Venezuelas energy market. Under the agreement, which Chavez
   pushed because, in his words, this is what is needed in the world in
   order to break with unilateralism. As a result, Caracas will help
   Beijing with additions to the latters strategic oil reserves in
   exchange for Chinese investment in Venezuelas agricultural sector and
   the development of fifteen currently shut down oil fields. This
   meeting was preceded by Chavezs renewed calls for the creation of
   PetroSur, a Latin American version of OPEC. In an interview with IPS,
   political scientist Alberto Garrido, of the University of Los Andes,
   reasoned that Chavez is trying to give a regional, Latin American
   dimension to his Bolivarian revolution, as reflected in documents from
   his movement that date back to far before he made it to power.

<p>This dimension cannot simply be chalked up to the Chavistas heady
   nationalistic rhetoric or to Chavezs frequent cheeky barbs against
   Washington. Rather, Chavez likely sees such a block as a defensive
   bulwark against any conceivable future U.S. intervention against him
   as well as a means of gaining the kind of steely international
   leverage that has been famously found in OPEC. Garrido continued,
   Venezuela is not only buying Russian weapons to free itself from
   military dependence on Washington, but the government is also trying
   to get Venezuelans ready for a possible scenario of confrontation, as
   reflected by (Chavez's) recent calls to prepare the reserve.

<h>Chavezs Brinkmanship
<p>None of this can be welcome news to Washington policymakers who are
   having increasing difficulty finding, or even maintaining, stable
   sources of oil. With al-Qaeda attacks in Saudi Arabia, the insurgents
   continuing sabotage of Iraqi and Colombian pipelines, and civil unrest
   in Nigeria, U.S. oil managers can only get more desperate in their
   search for reliable petro exports. With the largest proven oil
   reserves in the Western Hemisphere (77.8 billion barrels), bilateral
   deals with China, and an attractive six-day transport time to U.S.
   ports as opposed to five weeks from the Middle East Chavez is forcing
   Washington to take a more protracted look south. Whether the volatile
   Venezuelan leader is playing a reckless game with Washington that
   could get him swatted, or is adroitly acting in his countrys best
   interests, is a question that could be explosively answered in a
   relatively short period.

<h>Evocations of the Monroe Doctrine
<p>In 2003, China surpassed Japan as the worlds second largest oil
   consumer. Given that by 2025 Chinas net oil imports are projected to
   be 9.4 million barrels per day (bbl/d), the U.S. Energy Information
   Agency predicts that by 2030 China will be importing as much oil as
   the U.S. is currently (11.8 million bbl/d). With its energy
   consumption expected to double in the next decade, China is looking
   into markets that traditionally have supplied most of their crude to
   the U.S. Though Beijing has no choice but to attempt to sate its
   countrys skyrocketing petro demands, the China problem, from
   Washingtons view, is that any increase in Beijings dependence on
   Caracas invariably cuts into one of its few remaining, relatively
   stable sources of crude. Ironically, then, Washington must either
   throw many carrots at Caracas, or use a very big stick against it.

<p>Drawing a bead on the largest Western Hemispheric reserves would
   certainly represent a dicey move on Beijings part. Moreover, Chinas
   recent initiative towards Venezuela comes at a time when Beijing has
   just recently indicated that it has similar designs on Canadian oil
   markets that today are dominated by the U.S. In other words, not only
   is Beijing poking its nose in our backyard, but Washingtons front yard
   as well. The New York Times reported on December 23, 2004 that,
   according to Murray Smith, a former Alberta energy minister, The China
   outlet would change our dynamic. Our main link would still be with the
   U.S., but this would give us multiple markets and competition for a
   prized resource." How will Washington view Beijings initiative towards
   the USs largest source of oil imports? The same Times story cited
   Calgarys The National Post, which pithily editorialized, Watch the
   Americans have a hissy fit if a Chinese incursion materializes . . .
   So far, the Americans have taken Canada's energy for granted.

<p>Thus, the immediate short-term problem facing Washington from the
   Caracas/Beijing axis is two-fold; on the one hand, it cannot allow
   China to get too cozy with one of its closest suppliers, which may
   provoke Washington to exhume the Monroe Doctrine. On the other hand,
   Washingtons current policy of siding with the anti-Chavez opposition
   risks the very outcome Washington seeks to avoid; pushing Caracas into
   Beijings arms or precipitating an anti-Washington embargo. Given the
   seemingly unstoppable popularity of Chavez, who has, to date, won two
   presidential elections and a referendum all with comfortable
   majorities the first sensible thing Washington must do is cease its
   open courting of the opposition. After all, how would Washington
   policymakers feel if French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin
   spent millions of euros in support of a domestic opposition in the
   U.S., whose stated goal was the removal of President Bush from office?

<p>If the NED intends to live up to its own charter, then it has to stop
   backing the egregiously undemocratic, even authoritarian methods of
   the opposition. Claiming that Chavez must die like a dog because he
   deserves it, former president and would-be leader of the opposition,
   Carlos Andres Perez, revealed his reverence for democratic ideals in
   an interview with the Caracas daily El Nacional last July: "We can't
   just get rid of Chavez and immediately have a democracy... we will
   need a transition period of two or three years to lay the foundations
   for a state where the rule of law prevails . . . When Chavez falls, we
   must shut down the National Assembly (Congress) and also the Supreme
   Court.

<h>Kissinger Redux?
<p>Though Secretary of Donald Defense Rumsfeld has most likely managed to
   exhaust the offensive capacity of the US military for the foreseeable
   future, it would behoove the increasingly feisty Chavez to review the
   recently declassified British intelligence document of December 13,
   1973 entitled Middle East Possible Use of Force by the United States.
   The Foreign Office memo cited a warning by former Secretary of Defense
   James R. Schlesinger to the British ambassador in Washington, Lord
   Cromer, that the administration would not tolerate threats from
   under-developed, under-populated countries. As noted by The Washington
   Post in January of 2004, Kissinger later wrote in his memoir, Years of
   Upheaval: These were not empty threats. I ordered a number of studies
   from the key departments on countermeasures against Arab members of
   OPEC if the embargo continued. By the end of the month, several
   contingency plans had been completed. Given that the U.S. annually
   imports as much or more oil from Venezuela as from Riyadh, Chavez
   should be well advised that any talk of an embargo could trigger a
   U.S. military intervention. He may risk setting the stage for this
   possibility if he is perceived by Washington as being too nettlesome
   in setting up a new OPEC, or if he gets too close to Beijing for
   Washingtons comfort.

<p>Some analysts are already predicting a global clash between the U.S.
   and China over oil reserves that could trigger a veritable casus
   belli. As stated by Gal Luft, executive director of the Institute for
   the Analysis of Global Security, in a recent editorial in The Los
   Angeles Times, Without a comprehensive strategy designed to prevent
   China from becoming an oil consumer on par with the U.S., a superpower
   collision is in the cards. Dr. Luft suggests the U.S. do everything it
   can to shift China in the direction of non-petro based energy
   supplies, such as hydrogen or natural gas. However, barring such a
   spectacular advance in the technology of harvesting hydrogen fuel
   cells or the like, China will need to look anywhere it can in order to
   satisfy its petro consumption demand.

<p>So far, neither Chinese nor U.S. authorities have, at least publicly,
   anticipated anything like a global clash over energy sources. Reported
   by Stephanie Ho of AXcess News, Chinese Embassy spokesman Sun Weide
   said, "Of course, as our two economies continue to grow, we both need
   reliable and, I think, affordable energy supplies... So, there is very
   good basis for cooperation between the two countries." But such
   optimism belies the fact that Washington is facing an almost certain
   intrusion into its oil markets by the worlds second largest petro
   importer. Though Beijing will somehow have to satisfy its energy
   demand, which grows annually at 7.5%, Washington will not look kindly
   on any such incursion into its traditional oil suppliers. As observed
   by Luft in The New York Times, "China's gone after the low-hanging
   fruit so far. Now they're entering another level of ambition, in
   places such as Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and Canada that are well within
   the American sphere."

<p>Washington could begin repairing its frayed relationship with Caracas
   by supporting what is bound to be a growing oil-based alliance between
   Caracas and Beijing. Given the near inevitability of this new
   alliance, Washington would be foolish to obstruct Chinas economic
   growth by trying to dictate to Chavez where he can and cannot sell his
   countrys oil. Furthermore, just as many U.S. public figures are
   demanding that their government reduce its imports of Middle East oil,
   so too are Venezuelans urging Chavez to reduce his countrys
   traditional reliance on the U.S.'s oil consumption. Now that China is
   offering Chavez just that opportunity, the question is, will
   Washington tolerate a Sino-Venezuelan petro pact or begin dusting off
   the Monroe Doctrine?
<p>Note: With China now making moves in the Canadian energy sector, it is
   important that we know the larger issues at hand. They will all play
   off one another.
