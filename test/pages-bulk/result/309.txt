<p>Check out these angry emails we get from new car dealers: The Good,
   The Mad, The Ugly:

<h>From: Mike Schroeder
<h>Subject: CarBuyingTips.com Question
<p>I wanted to let you know, you piece of s**t, that a lot of honest
   people make a living selling cars. The biggest scam is you and this
   bulls**t service! Bl*w Me!

<p>I cleaned up Mr. Mature's words with a **. Some auto dealers like us,
   some hate us. More amusing nasty grams below.

<h>How Bad Is Your Credit?
<p>Before buying a new car, you MUST get your credit report and credit
   score from Experian,Equifax orTrueCredit. Then auto dealers can't lie
   and say: "Youhave bad credit." Most people have black marks that need
   to be removed before applying for new car loans. Dealers should never
   know more about your credit than you.

<h>Which New Car Dealer Scams Did You Fall For?
<p>Most new car dealers are honest, but there are some who will scam you.
   Read our annualTop 10 New Car Dealer Scams.

<h>"This new car is hot, everyone pays MSRP. We don't have to sell it
   cheaper."
<p>A common sales tactic in auto sales. If they have any in stock of your
   newcar or SUV, then it's not in demand or there would be 6 month
   waiting lists. If your new car is not "in demand," then you should
   "demand" less than MSRP for your newvehicle.

<h>The Best Time for New Car Buying
<p>Many people ask when to buy new cars. Read our tips on the best time
   for buying new cars.

<h>When buying new cars, don't trade in a car you owe money on!
<p>I get complaints from people who traded in a used car they owed money
   on to buy a new car, and 2 months later were shocked to hear the new
   car dealer did not pay offtheir car loan in 10 days as promised. With
   this scam dealers pay you less for your trade than they promised. When
   the bank calls, YOU are responsible. The carloan is still in your
   name, until the dealer pays it off. When buying new cars, if you trade
   a used car in, make the dealer put in writing that he will pay off
   yourcar loan in 10 days, or no deal. Then he is liable.

<h>Early Car Lease Termination Without Penalties? Taking Over a Short
   Term Lease?
<p>Shift your strategy away from terminating an auto lease early, trading
   your car and paying huge penalties. A better strategy is transferring
   your car lease to another person via an auto lease trade. Sites like
   Swapalease.comand LeaseTrader.com can do a car lease swap for you, and
   reassign your auto lease to another buyer, savingyou thousands. You
   can also use them to take over a short term lease, where the previous
   owner already took the big depreciation hit.

<h>Sell Your Used Car Yourself
<p>You can get $3,000 more for your car at online auto classifieds sites:
   Cars.com andCarsDirect

<h>Auto Refinance your car loan to Lower APR in a few days
<p>Read our useful chapter Auto Refinancing Tips & Scams to Avoid

<h>FRAUD ALERT:
<p>Read our Investigative Report: Consumer Guide To Avoiding eBay Fraud,
   Escrow Internet Fraud, Check Fraud,Auto Fraud, and Nigerian Scams. Our
   work on these scams was profiled by an MSNBC article. If you're
   selling autos online, don't accept a cashier's check until you read
   our report. These car buying fraud and escrow fraud scams nail
   hundreds ofvictims daily on cars, cameras, jewelry, computers. If a
   seller tells you to use an escrow other than escrow.com, it's probably
   a scam.

<h>Not Every Car Salesperson Is Out To Scam You

<p>We've dealt with many honest new car salespeople. We're here to
   educate new car buyers and only belittle car dealers who lie and
   cheat. Most automobile dealers careabout you and will give you a great
   new car deal. They deserve to profit, they have mortgages, "mouths to
   feed", and so do you, so haggle a new car deal that is fairfor you and
   the automobile dealer. Treat them with the same respect that you would
   expect, and don't lie. Justify your offers in a professional business
   manner. Thenicest new car dealer can still be a tough seller.
   Salespeople who complain we are lumping all car salespeople as "sewer
   rats" misread the word some to meanall. Don't forget furniture stores,
   who mark up 400%. With 50% off sales, they still double their money.
   We had our furniture shipped from wholesalers in theCarolinas. Read my
   article How To Buy Home Furniture From Furniture Stores. Jewelerscheat
   too. On my site BridalTips.com, readHow To Buy Diamond Engagement
   Rings And Avoid Scams.

<h>Do's and Don'ts When Buying new cars:

<l>NEVER bring your checkbook with you to a car dealer to buy new
       cars
<l>Put deposits on a credit card. Run from automobile dealers who
       "only take checks."

<h>Angry Emails We Get From New Car Dealers: The Good, The Mad, The Ugly

<p>I get email from new car dealers, some professional, offering
   disagreement, some give us more info, saying they wish the bad seeds
   were not ruining it for everyone:

<p>Hi Jeff,
<p>I stumbled onto your website, and you have great information!! I've
   been in the car business for 12 years 11 of which have been at the
   same dealership.I've never heard or seen of some of the things that
   you say to look out for (credit insurance slipped into leases, hiding
   trades, etc.). Haveyou received e-mail that this goes on (within the
   last 5 years )? I'd be curious to hear from you about some of these
   things. Again, congratson a well informed web site, and look forward
   to hearing from you. Sincerely, Paul Albert, Sales Manager, Bob Sharp
   Nissan

<p>Nice guy, he knows we're here to help. Then I got this one below, also
   a Nissan dealer. Big difference in attitude, showing what some new
   cardealers think of you. He's from the old school of selling new cars.

<p>Dear Idiot,
<p>I invite you to spend a week in my dealership to see how things really
   work. Price does not sell cars, the car itself does. If some one
   really loves a car they willpay a premium price for that vehicle. And
   normally they are the happiest of all customers. The goofball who
   comes in with all of the internet info., consumer reportsprintouts,
   and a chip on their shoulder saying "I WILL NOT GET SCREWED!!!!", are
   the people that we always have the nagging problems with. The only
   thing I can say toyou is to get some expirience from the other side
   before shooting your mouth off, it just makes you look that much less
   intelligent. Unsincerely yours.

<p>That should be "insincerely yours". I guess he is not a big fan of
   Cars.com orInvoiceDealers I thought customer service and not referring
   to us as "goofballs" sells new cars. Welcome to the new way of selling
   autos.

<p>I have got to tell you that I absolutely LOVE your website. The
   messages from certain "Dealers" are priceless. I am a General Manager
   from a small family-owned car dealership located in Kansas, and
   everything you write (or rant) about is exactly what all of us need to
   hear (Customers and Dealers alike).
<p>The days of over pricing our product and tricking people into making
   decisions that aren't right for them are over. The true Car
   "Retailers" are posed to change thestatus quo. Thank you for the
   education you provide "My" customer. Not everyone in this business is
   scared of you (rather they embrace your perceptions of ourbusiness).
   Great Job and keep up the good work!!!

<p>Someone's grouchy. I like how he says people like ME give the new car
   business a bad name. The vehicle market had that stigma before I came
   around. I'm giving new car buying a good name. We don't scare people
   out of new car dealers, we send hundreds of confident new vehicle
   buyers into dealers through Cars.com or InvoiceDealers
   , so he has no clue. Bigdifference between a $15 steak and a $25,000
   new SUV or car with $1500 of overpriced fabric protection, VIN#
   etching, "lifetime" wax jobs and alarms.

<p>What do you know about buying cars? well i am a car salesman. you
   people think you know everything!! selling cars is my profession!!!!
   that is my living. i dont scam anyone you people think that you can
   get the car for free. well you cant(surprise)! let me ask you
   this,when you go shopping for food do you tell thecashier that you
   will give them 50 cents for that 3.00 package of meat?even though
   there is a 300% mark up margin in you food!i didnt think so!!! you
   tell the cust. to go on kelly blue book and see what there trade in is
   worth. kelly blue book is false!!!(suprise) call kelly blue book ane
   see if they would buy your car for that ridiculious price!! i didnt
   think so. its websites such as this one that give the cust the wrong
   impression on how to buy a vehicle! please if you dont know anything
   about the car buisness dont put garbage up like this S***!! if thats
   all you have to do is badmouth the dealership then get a F***ING
   LIFE!!!!
<p>p.s. I BET YOU WONT POST THIS!!!!!

<p>I cleaned up Mr. Mature's words with a ****. Why is it that whining
   salespeople complain "I never argue the price at the grocery store?" I
   think they all read took same ineffective vehicle sales course. This
   guy's a real Einstein. Grocery store managers are laughing at him,
   with his uneducated claims of 300% profit. Grocers only make 1% to 3%
   profit. We don't ask grocers to drop the price on an 89 cent can of
   peas. We use coupons, or buy it at a cheaperstore. When a store sells
   you a steak, they don't lie about your credit score; force you to buy
   VIN# etching; or a steak warranty you didn't want. Mr. Autos thinks
   weknow nothing? That's why our visitors report new car savings of
   $2000-$3000 after using our automotive buying advice and savings over
   $4000-$6000 on new SUVs, trucksand minivans.

<p>I had to clean up Mr. Mature's words with a ****. Would you buy an SUV
   or minivan from him? He saw I posted his last email:

<p>BOO HOO BOO HOO, you put my letter on your website, good for you, so
   you must be proud of yourself for saving everyone so much money.Why
   don't you make a site for the local MALL and give them all a hard time
   for marking up THEIR products?? You won't because people expect to pay
   a profit to thosestores, why shouldn't they pay a profit for our
   product?? Because web sites such as yours give the PUBLIC a bad name
   with car dealers so we can just hate each otheruntil infinity. The
   funny thing is, the easy going people who do let us make a profit are
   the ones that we treasure the most, not all because of money, but
   insteadbecause they are nice people and don't expect something for
   nothing like the losers that enter your site. ALL OF YOU STAY AWAY
   FROM MY STORE, I HAVE NO INTEREST INSELLING YOU A CAR!!

<p>I can imagine his slogan: "We add the "vice" in Service". I mention
   shopping malls? This is CarBuyingTips.com,not a site on malls.
   Automobile dealers complain that we tell you to offer 3% dealer
   profit, while shopping malls earn 10%. I'd rather own an auto
   dealership with 3% of a $25,000 sale than a mall store with 10% of a
   $4000 sale. You do the math. Many visitors, after seeing his emails,
   flamed him. After he begged me, I deleted his auto dealership email
   address, he couldn't take it anymore.

<p>My momma always told me, "Life is like a box of new car dealers..."

<p>How are you doin Jeff?
<p>I am just writing to let you know that I am an Internet Manager in the
   #1 Chevy dealer in Nassau County (NY). I think that sites like this
   are great. It gives theconsumer info and definitely helps them form
   getting hurt. I just want to let the people know that not all of us
   are bad. I am in this business to make a living andput food on the
   table. I work very hard and I EXPECT to make money from it. Of course
   it has to be legit. I feel that the car business does have a bad rap,
   but I amworking on it on my end. Just a message to the folks reading:
   It isn't necessarily a bad thing for a dealer to make money. Be fair
   and they will be fair towards you(most of us). Don't expect something
   for nothing though. There has to be some profit. Just do some homework
   and you'll be fine. Buying a warranty isn't a bad thingeither. It's
   just like insurance. Over paying for a warranty is bad though. Like I
   said, do some homework and you will be ok. Thank you ! for reading. -

<p>your article is offensive and absolute bull****! i have been in this
   business for a long time and have come across many people like you who
   couldn't hack it in the auto industry and wind up trying to "expose"
   dealers as rip off artists our profit margins are low and have been
   for the past couple of years. what are you selling? what is your
   profit margin why dont you attack the furniture or clothing business
   there profit margins can be any where from 2 to 500%. better yet why
   don't you go f*** yourself!

<p>I need to buy a new SUV so I can buy more red asterisks. They always
   whine that I mention new car dealers instead of furniturestores. So I
   caved in: How to Buy Home Furniture From Furniture Stores.

<p>Jeff, I visited your sight for the first time today and found it very
   interesting. I am the General Sales Mgr. for a multi-franchise dealer
   in North-Eastern PA.I think your sight is very helpful to customers
   and we welcome all customers who bring in internet research with open
   arms. This is 2003 and people want to shop with convenience and
   accuracy. These people who give you a hard time must be "old school"
   salespeople. My message to them is to try selling from the heart, be
   genuine with your customers, and under promise and over deliver. If
   you can't truly do this, GET OUT OF THE BUSINESS! It's not people like
   Jeff that give us a bad name, it's people like you. Shawn Hunter GSM R
   & R AUTO GROUP SCHUYLKILL HAVEN, PA.

<p>While most car salespeople are good honest people, some live by this
   principle: It is morally wrong to allow suckers to keep their money.
