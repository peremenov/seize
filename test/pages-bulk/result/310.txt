<h>Why Choose Art and Design at Carmel?
<p>In our everyday life we are surrounded by visual imagery, which shapes
   our experiences and thinking, ranging from advertising and film to
   music, architecture and fashion. By studying one or two specialist
   areas in the department, you can make a valuable contribution to the
   visual world.
<p>We offer a wide variety of specialist AS and A2 levels, where it is
   possible to explore media and techniques in an imaginative and
   exciting way. You have the opportunity to be taught by specialist and
   well-qualified tutors, with enviable pass rates, who will support you
   through your time at the college.
<p>Although examinations are important, and hard work and commitment are
   essential to achieving your artistic aims, a great sense of
   satisfaction, enjoyment and fulfilment can be achieved by expressing
   your ideas confidently in the scale or medium you choose. We, as
   tutors, are concerned with working with individual students to
   maximise their potential.
