                           <p>Diary - March 13, 2001
                            <p>Melbourne, Australia

   <p>This is being written on March 30, 2001.  It is being updated on April
   5, 2001.  I apologize for the delay in getting this posted.

   <p>(An additional one-word revision was made on May 14 to correct a silly
   typo - nothing substantive.) 

   <p>The preliminary report may be found at
   http://www.icann.org/minutes/prelim-report-13mar01.htm.

   <p>This was a public board meeting.

   <p>When I left Santa Cruz, California to go to the Melbourne meeting,
   there was no well-formed agenda.  For the most part the resolutions
   below were formulated by ICANN "staff" on the night before the March 13
   meeting.  Indeed the first time I saw the text of these resolutions was
   when they appeared on the computer monitors before me during
   the meeting.

   <p>The general sense of these resolutions was discussed in an almost
   closed meeting of the Board on the evening of March 12.  I say "almost
   closed" because of the presence and active participation of at least
   two people (other than ICANN's in-house counsel, who I believe is
   an appropriate person to invite to a board meeting) who are not members
   of the ICANN board, one of whom is neither an ICANN officer nor even an
   ICANN employee.  I do not feel that this is appropriate.  If these
   people want to act as ICANN board members, then it is my feeling that
   they ought to stand for election.  Otherwise I feel that as long as the
   public is excluded then these people ought to be excluded
   unless explicitly invited for a limited purpose to provide information
   on a specific matter.

   <p>It is my feeling that since real discussion of matters occurred at this
   March 12 meeting, that such meeting ought to have been open to
   the public or at least recorded so that the public could hear what
   what discussed.  I do not subscribe to the point of view that ICANN
   that board members require a cloak of secrecy except with respect to
   personnel matters, litigation, or contract negotiations.

   <p>I must say that I felt rushed.  I felt that "staff" had created a
   situation in which major policy matters were dumped in the Board's lap
   with inadequate time for study of for review by the Board or the
   public.  One point that I dowant to make clear: I have no evidence or
   indication that this situation was the result of any intent or purpose
   and I see no reason why anyone should entertain any theory that this
   situation was the result of any manipulative intention.  That does not
   mean, however, that we (ICANN) ought to not improve procedures so that
   this situation does not frequently recur.  (We must recognize that some
   matters will always be changing right up to the last minute and that
   sometimes everyone ought to simply accept the situation and give such
   leeway as is reasonable.)

   <p>As an example of what happens when there is a rush - When the
   resolution on the report of the so-called Ad Hoc Group (on addressing)
   was presented it was not clearly pointed out that the report was not
   approved by the full membership of the Ad Hoc Group.  It was only
   later, in a chance meeting at an airport, that I found out that at
   least two members of that group - people whose technical judgment I
   trust - refused to sign-off on the report.

   <p>It is my belief that no resolution should be voted upon by the ICANN
   board until the exact text of that resolution has been posted for at
   least several days.

   <p>There is also a matter of completeness.  ICANN's web site is the
   primary vehicle by which information is made available to the public
   and to the board.  Yet that website is sometimes as impenetrable as
   the Minotaur's maze.  Consequently it is now my belief that every
   resolution must contain usable references to all materials directly
   pertaining to that resolution.

   <p>I felt that the ICANN board was engaging in several significant
   procedural failures, principally the failure to have adequate time for
   public review and failure to properly delegate matters to the DNSO
   as required by the ICANN by-laws.

   <p>My primary focus during the meetings in Melbourne was the At-Large
   study.  I have significant reservations about that study, particularly
   since it's committee was selected without any input from theat-large
   community and with the expressed intention to exclude anyone who
   has indicated that they consider the at-large to be an important and
   necessary part of ICANN.  I endeavored to find a way to enhance the
   committee membership but found no way to do so that would have had even
   a prayer of being adopted by the ICANN board.

   <p>Although it was not a matter for vote, the proposed amendments to the
   VeriSign agreement did occupy a lot of discussion time.  Personally I
   was taken aback by the fait accompli "take it or leave it" package that
   ICANN's "staff" presented to the Board.  Given the gravity of those
   amendments I considered the process to be an inversion of the
   proper relationship between the should-be-master policy-making role of
   the Board and the should-be subservient policy-executing role of
   "staff".

   <p>Moreover, the VeriSign amendments do represent significant changes of
   Domain Name policy.  And the ICANN bylaws dictate that such matters be
   delegated to the DNSO unless the board makes a finding that there
   are facts to bypass that clearly defined requirement to delegate to the
   DNSO. The board has not made any such finding with respect to the
   VeriSign amendments. I recognize the argument that says that the
   VeriSign amendments were not "policy" changes, but I am not persuaded
   by them.

   <p>With regard to the DNSO, it is my perception that it is a body that is
   wracked with internal problems and structural biases.  As such I have a
   difficult time giving credence to its actions.  This makes it
   very difficult with regard to the fact that much as it is procedurally
   critical to delegate matters such as the VeriSign amendments to the
   DNSO, it is equally difficult to believe that the DNSO would be able to
   synthesize a decision that could be considered as having been fairly
   decided by all parts of the Internet community.

   <p>As an example of this lack of credibility of the DNSO, I
   am particularly concerned how the DNSO's Names Council eviscerated the
   proposals for structural reform of the DNSO that came out of the DNSO
   working group focused on those questions.

   <p>Now for the resolutions themselves:

<h>Approval of Minutes

   <p>I voted for this one.  (There's usually not much controversy about
   approving minutes. ;-)

<h>Recommendations of Reconsideration Committee

   <p>I  voted to accept the two reports.

   <p>The two "Requests For Reconsideration" that were up for approval did
   not strike me as particularly compelling in and of themselves.  In this
   case I felt that the Reconsideration Committee came up with the correct
   result.

   <p>However, I do find that these two requests are indicative of a larger
   pattern of discontent with the overall TLD selection process.

<h>Ad Hoc Group

   <p>I voted against accepting the Ad Hoc group's report.  I consider the
   entire Ad Hoc Group to be beyond ICANN's proper scope of authority and
   hence it would be improper to accept its report no matter what its
   quality.

   <p>I note, however, that I have subsequently learned that the report that
   was tendered was not the report of the entire Ad Hoc Group - the report
   was unable to obtain the approval of at various group members in whom
   I place a great deal of technical credence.  It is not clear to me that
   other board members were aware of the report's shaky foundation at the
   time the vote was made on the resolution.

<h>Membership of At Large Membership Study Committee

   <p>I voted for this one, even though, as I mentioned above, I have major
   reservations about this At-Large Study Committee, particularly
   its charter, its membership, and its ability to arrive at a result that
   will be granted legitimacy by the public.

   <p>I still hold hope that this committee can be expanded to
   include additional members who have strong at-large credentials.

<h>Budget for At Large Membership Study Committee

   <p>I voted yes.  I see no reason why my reservations about the At-Large
   Study Committee's composition or charter should prevent it from
   at least trying to show me wrong.

<h>Proposed Revision to VeriSign Agreements

   <p>Please note that this resolution was not to approve the
   proposed changes to the VeriSign contract but merely continues the
   admittedly limited process for public comment.

   <p>As I said during the meeting, my feeling is that proper procedure
   requires that this matter be passed to the DNSO, although I do
   have reservations about the ability of the DNSO to render a decision
   given its internal procedural infirmities.

<h>New TLD Agreements

   <p>I voted for this.  That was a mistake.  I wish I had voted against.

   <p>My affirmative vote was the result of inadequate time to study and to
   receive public input.  I have since learned various things about these
   contracts that, had I known at the time, would have made me vote
   against approval.

   <p>I knee-jerk accepted these contracts based on a desire to move the
   long-delayed TLD process.  I am now resolved to not let myself
   be railroaded by last-minute "staff" agendas to accept something that
   I do not believe has received adequate review by myself or the public.

   <p>Among the matters that I learned about too late were the concern that
   these contracts may establish what amounts to a "most favored registry"
   situation in which incumbent registries may be able to use
   these contracts as a means to prevent experimentation and evolution of
   new contractual vehicles with respect to subsequent registries.

   <p>Another such matter was the nature of the buy-out situation that may
   occur when a registry contract comes up for renewal.

   <p>Similarly, I was unaware of the lack of an effective "fullstop"
   mechanism or other protective means that would, to my way of thinking,
   be necessary parts of any live experiment or test, such as these
   new TLDs are purported to be.

<h>DNSO Review

   <p>There was a bit of procedural chaos at this point in the meeting.  We
   managed to get off onto a short discussion of a DNSO constituency for
   individual people who own domain names.  I consider that to be
   something that we very much do want in the DNSO.  However, the
   matter on the table at that time was the DNSO review and, as I said,
   there was a bit of confusion caused by the mix of the two issues.

   <p>I wanted to discuss the fact that I believe that the DNSO
   review process was, simply put, unacceptable.  I do not accept that the
   report that emanated from the Names Council is an accurate reflection
   of the infirmities of the DNSO.

<h>Appointment of Auditors

   <p>I voted yes.

<h>Disbursement and Check Signing Authority

   <p>I voted yes.

<h>Handling of DNSO Funds

   <p>This is something that I was very pleased to vote for.  I have been
   very concerned about the lack of clarity surrounding the funds
   that ICANN holds on behalf of the DNSO.  There is no reason to suspect
   that there is any problem; rather I feel that when money is involved,
   absolute clarity of accounting is important, particularly when there
   are discussions about alienating that money at some future date to
   another entity.

<h>Agreements with ccTLD Managers

   <p>I abstained from this vote.  I simply do not have enough knowledge of
   this matter for me to feel comfortable that I could have made
   an informed decision.

<h>Internationalized Domain Names

   <p>I voted yes.

   <p>Internationalized domain names are a big and complex issue.  And I
   believe that the committee that is formed by this resolution will help
   all of us better understand the issues.

<h>Thanks to Local Hosts and Sponsors

   <p>Of course I voted yes.  The Melbourne hosts and sponsors did a very
   nice job and deserve much thanks.

<h>Thanks to Lennie and Mike Roberts

   <p>Henry IV, King of France from 1589 through 1610 was reputed to have
   said to have avoided a battle by making a pragmatic recognition
   that "Paris is worth a mass".  I believe that the departure of
   Mike Roberts from ICANN will bring a significant change in the
   personality of the organization.  I thank him for leaving.
