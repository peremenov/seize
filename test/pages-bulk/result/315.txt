                    <h>CAW LOCAL 3000 MEMBERS AT STARBUCKS 

          <h>UNION GIVES STRIKE NOTICE AFTER COMPANY REFUSES "WRITTEN
                RECOMMENDATIONS" ASKS MEDIATOR TO BOOK OUT 
 
   <p>April 25, 1997

   <p>At the Labour Relations Board last Monday the Union, after a number of
   hours of discussion, offered Starbucks "a way out" of both the
   Distribution Centre crisis that they created and the impasse in
   collective bargaining. We proposed the following:

   <p>- three days of negotiations with the assistance of both the present
   mediator, Debbie Apps and the Associate Chair of Mediation, Brian
   Foley. The Company also had to come to the table with a WAGE OFFER.
   Following these negotiations we proposed that the mediators make
   written recommendations. Under the process of written recommendations
   both sides are obligated to take a vote on the principals:

   <p>i.e. Starbucks Howard Shultz or his designate

   <p>CAW Local 3000 Starbucks employees represented by the Union

   <p>Starbucks refused and so the Union now has asked the Mediator to "book
   out" and we have served seventy-two hours strike notice. As we are
   under Section 55 proceedings the Associate Chair of Mediation
   determines when the Parties are in a legal position to exercise their
   mandate. In his letter to the Parties, Mr. Foley states that the
   strike/lockout option will be legal "just after May 14th". This is not
   uncommon if written recommendations are rejected by one side as an
   option. Earlier today I concluded a first collective agreement a
   couple of hours before the notice had legal effect. This was at Link
   Technologies in Delta. Oh, by the way, that Company was threatening to
   close its doors too but the membership held firm - 125 workers were
   involved.

   <p>At last Wednesday's meeting it was nice to see our members support the
   combination of the unstrike at the retail outlets and picketing at the
   Distribution Centre. This was originally planned for May 1st if we
   were in a legal position but this has been nixed at least until May
   15th.

   <h>HARGROVE TO MEET YOUR NEGOTIATIONS COMMITTEE AND LOCAL UNIONS'
   LEADERSHIP.

   <p>Our National Union President, Buzz Hargrove will meet with our Union
   Negotiating Committee and the Lower Mainland CAW Local Union
   leadership this Wednesday at our Union Hall in New Westminster.

   <p>After his assistant, Peggy Nash, and the undersigned gave a report to
   our recent CAW National Leadership Conference in Ontario and Buzz said
   "if Starbucks does not return to the table and deal with the key
   issues including wages we may have to organize a boycott" (of course
   when we are in a legal position to do so).

   <p>A worldwide boycott of Starbucks would only be as a last resort.
   However, Starbucks has to realize with closure of the Distribution
   Centre and its failure to bargain in good faith with our Union the
   result is a boycott. We will not only rely on the strength of our
   membership at Starbucks but on the entire support of the labour
   movement around the world.

   <h>UNION NEGOTIATING COMMITTEE TO ALSO MEET CLC HEAD - BOB WHITE

   <p>On Saturday afternoon at our Union Hall (May 3rd) Bob White will meet
   with your Committee. In addition to heading up the Canadian Labour
   Congress, Bob is an officer of the International Confederation of
   Trade Unions. We know we can count on Bob to get the word out on
   Starbucks conduct in negotiations to date.

   <h>GENEVA DELEGATES HEAR FIRST HAND

   <p>CAW Local 3000 President, Denise Kellahan, spoke of the announced
   closure of the Distribution Centre and the other key issues in
   bargaining to the Food Union's world wide Congress in Geneva,
   Switzerland a couple of weeks ago. She has made some invaluable future
   contacts. Seventy-four countries from around the world attended the
   Congress.

   <h>GUATEMALAN LABOUR EDUCATION SUPPORT GROUP CONTACTS CAW

   <p>Stephen Coats informs us that Starbucks wants a meeting soon with his
   Chicago based group after his group threatened a boycott of Starbucks
   for its failure to enforce its Code of Practice for coffee growers in
   Guatemala.

   <p>Stephen seemed to be really upset with the announced closure of the
   Distribution Centre just after our successful strike vote. He has
   asked us for more details about our dispute.

   <h>LRB HEARING MAY 7TH - 9TH

   <p>The adjudication side of the Labour Relations Board will begin to hear
   sworn evidence on the Union's complaint concerning of the Company's
   illegal lockout and bargaining in bad faith surrounding the announced
   closure of the Distribution Centre and the failure of the Company to
   produce a wage offer to date as well as its illegal proposal on
   benefits.

   <p>These hearing take place at the Labour Relations Board which is
   located at Library Square. They are open to the public but have very
   limited seating unfortunately.

   <h>'CITIZENS IN SUPPORT OF STARBUCKS WORKERS' BEING FORMED

   <p>Since the public announcement of the closure of the Distribution
   Centre we have had lots of calls. This has resulted in a 'Citizens
   Group' being formed to support you.

   <p>For better future wages and conditions and in solidarity,

   <p>On behalf of CAW Local 3000,

   <p>Roger Crowther, National Representative
