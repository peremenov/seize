   <h>Bringing Home Your Newly Adopted Rescue Chesapeake Bay Retriever

   <p>First things first - CONGRATULATIONS!!! We are all so happy that you
   chose to help a Chessie in need and were willing to open your home and
   hearts to this Brown Dog!

   <p>The theme of this information packet is "SET YOUR DOG UP TO SUCCEED!"
   By understanding your new dog's behavior - you can anticipate problems
   and correct them calmly and as quickly as possible. Be reasonable in
   your expectations. We want the adoption of your Chessie to be a
   "win-win" situation on both sides!
   
   <h>Before you pick up your new Chesapeake Bay Retriever
   <p>Since you've chosen to adopt a Chesapeake Bay retriever, you've
   probably educated yourself about 1) the reasons this breed is unique
   (American bred retriever, not related to Goldens and Labradors), 2)
   the breed's behavior characteristics (intensely loyal, protective,
   sensitive and serious) and 3) changes to your current lifestyle that
   this Chessie will cause (time set aside daily for exercise and work,
   either obedience or retrieving). The Chesapeake Bay Retriever Relief &
   Rescue website (www.cbrrescue.org) has information about the
   uniqueness of this breed, Chessie behavior and dog ownership that you
   might want to read and review.

   <p>The adoption coordinator that you worked with told you about your
   Chessie's history, veterinary information, evaluations and current
   eating, sleeping and activity routines so that his transition into
   your home can be easier. Dogs need order and are extremely routine
   oriented. We recommend that you find out all you can about his routine
   - and duplicate what you can - before you start to re-orient him to
   the rhythms and schedules of your home. Work out your house rules and
   dog-care regimen in advance among the human members of your household.
   Who will walk the dog first thing in the morning? Who will feed him at
   night? Will Chessie be allowed on the couch or bed? Where will he
   sleep at night? Will he be crated?

   <p>To ensure a smooth transition, you will already have supplies (collar,
   ID tag, leash, food, bowls, crate and toys) for your Chessie.

   <p>Try and arrange the arrival of your new dog for a weekend - or when
   you can be home for a few days - for quality, hands-on time.

   <p>If you have resident pets, make sure they are up-to-date on their
   shots and in general good health before bringing home your new dog.
   Despite the best efforts of the rescue organization, previous owner or
   foster family, viruses can be spread and occasionally go home with
   adopted rescue dogs. You may wish to set up an appointment with your
   own vet to check out your new dog and set up an inoculation schedule,
   depending on the veterinary care your rescue dog has received.

   <p>Register for an obedience class. Don't ignore this very important step
   in setting yourself and your rescued Chessie up for success! Be dogged
   about finding an obedience class or trainer. There are many positive
   reinforcement-based dog obedience classes that teach dog manners,
   canine good citizenship and discipline. Try to register for a class
   starting about 3 to 4 weeks after your dog has come home with you. It
   is important that your new dog has some time to adjust to you and your
   home before putting him into the stimulating environment of an
   obedience class. Even the shortest "dog manners" course offered at
   your vet's will reinforce the new bond between you and your new
   Chessie, will give you a valuable face-to-face resource for questions
   about your dog's behavior, and will provide a powerful tool for
   moderating your rescue dog's less attractive behavior traits!
   Remember, Chessies need work - this is a really easy way to provide
   him with active, mental work that you'll approve of! The rewards are
   obvious - what a joy it is to have a well-mannered, trained Chessie
   companion!

   <p>New families often ask about changing the adopted dog's name. If you
   desire to, it is fine. Many times, the dogs are given names at random
   by a shelter. The dog will learn his new name if it's overused in the
   beginning. It is in no way traumatic to the dog to change his name.

   <p>When you arrive home...

   <h>Things to expect: 
   <p>You should expect your new dog to act differently than how he did when
   you met him at the foster/owner's home. He will be excited, nervous
   and maybe tired after the trip to your house. Being routine-oriented,
   your Chessie may have just gotten comfortable at his foster home and
   now recognizes that the routine is changing yet again. He doesn't know
   the smells, the sounds, and importantly, the routines and rules of
   your house. This is very confusing for your Chessie.

   <p>Dogs display anxiety and nervousness by: panting, pacing, lack of eye
   contact, "not listening," housebreaking accidents, excessive chewing,
   gastric upset (vomiting, diarrhea, loose stools), crying, whining,
   jumpiness and barking. This is a litany of behaviors any and every dog
   owner dreads! As long as you understand where these behaviors
   originate, you can perhaps address them before they appear and deal
   effectively when they do! Your goal in the next weeks is to reduce the
   "noise & confusion in his head" and get him to relax, to be calm and
   show him how to be good. Despite your joy at adopting this Chessie
   (and after a few enthusiastic hugs and kisses), you should be calm and
   gentle and firm with your Chessie. Talk to him in a calm, low voice as
   you travel home - avoid playing the car radio and having too many
   people with you when you pick him up.

   <p>All rescue dogs go through a "honeymoon period." After the first day
   or so, the dog may be very quiet and extraordinarily controlled and
   "good." The "real" dog appears two to four weeks later - after he's
   mostly figured out the house rules, the schedule of the days, and the
   characters of his new family. At this time, he'll start testing out
   his position in the pack, and may "regress" to puppyhood behaviors and
   "bad" behavior. Be patient with him, firm in your expectations, praise
   him for appropriate behavior - especially when he is lying quietly and
   behaving himself. Don't praise for nothing constantly - the dog will
   learn to tune out your praise over time!

   <h>Things to Do: 

   <h>LEASH YOUR DOG TO INTRODUCE HIM TO YOUR HOME!
   <p>When you first bring your new dog home, make sure you have her on a
   leash! Spend the first 15-30 minutes walking her outside around the
   perimeter of your yard or the area that you will be with her most on
   your property. Walk slowly - let her "lead" mostly - and let her sniff
   and pause if she wants to. She is getting used to the "lay of the
   land" and all the smells associated with her new home. She will
   undoubtedly relieve herself - this is her way of making herself at
   home by adding her mark to the smells of your home, and now her new
   home. Obviously you want this to happen outside! If you have a place
   you wish this to happen, encourage her to "get busy" in that area and
   praise her warmly when she does. The excitement of the move and new
   family will cause her to have to relieve herself more often than
   normal. You must be prepared to give her plenty of opportunities to do
   this in the beginning! Whenever the rescue dog is not confined,
   supervise her - set this dog up to win!

   <p>You might want to consider isolating the new dog from your resident
   dogs during the first entry to your home - he will appreciate safe and
   quiet at first as he explores your home. Crate your resident dog or
   have someone take him for a walk while your new dog explores.

   <p>Let the new dog explore the house - leave her on leash and make sure
   she's supervised AT ALL TIMES! We recommend leaving your new dog on
   leash in the house for the first day. Don't even leave the dog
   unsupervised while you answer the phone!

   <p>Once inside your house, a male may still accidentally mark a door,
   plant or chair when he first walks inside your home. This is out of
   nervousness (or he may smell another dog), so it is best to leave him
   on the leash indoors the first day. If he starts to lift his leg, give
   him a short jerk on the leash and tell him "No," that should stop him
   immediately and remind him of his housebreaking manners. Follow up
   this correction by taking him outside in case he's not just marking!
   Bear in mind that if your Chessie has a few accidents, it does not
   necessarily mean that he is not housebroken. We can't emphasize enough
   how much nerves and excitement can cause uncharacteristic accidents.
   Watch for typical pre-piddling behavior - circling, sniffing, etc. Do
   not scold or hit a dog for having an accident - rather, verbally get
   his attention, grab the leash, and take him right outside to his spot
   to do his business. If he does it, praise him! Once he relaxes and
   learns the rhythms and routines of your home, all his manners will
   return!

   <p>Even in a fenced yard, you'll want to leave your rescued Chessie on
   leash for the first week or so. This way, you can reinforce a recall
   command and help monitor pack behavior if you have other dogs. Until
   your new dog bonds to you and makes good eye contact, we recommend
   leaving her on leash.

   <h>PROVIDE QUIET TIME!
   <p>Quiet time will be important for your new Chessie in the first week.
   Because of his nervousness and anxiety, he will get worn out fast. His
   recent past may include a shelter stay which has worn him out with
   worry. Despite your excitement, try and resist inviting friends and
   relatives over to visit him. Give him time to get used to your
   immediate family and resident pets only. If the dog does not solicit
   play or attention from you, let him alone to sleep or establish
   himself. Believe it or not, we don't want you to force him to play at
   first!

   <h>FEED YOUR NEW DOG!
   <p>Feed your new dog twice a day; half in the morning, half at night. Ask
   and encourage the dog to sit before putting the bowl down. Put the
   food bowl down for 15 minutes. If the dog does not eat her food, pick
   up the bowl until the next mealtime. After a couple of days of this
   routing, even the most finicky of eaters will change their minds.
   Feeding this way you can monitor exactly how much she is eating.

   <p>If you have other dogs, feed your rescue dog away from them but at the
   same time. You can feed in the same room, but use opposite corners,
   putting the dominant dog's bowl down first. This is usually the
   resident dog on the first few nights - but that situation may change
   over time! You may want to arrange having another adult in the room
   for the first week of feedings to monitor the "pack behavior." Watch
   that each dog sticks to his own bowl. Keep vigilant over feeding time
   for a couple of months until the pack positions are worked out.

   <h>CONSIDER CRATING YOUR DOG!
   <p>Many of the Chessies that pass through rescue have been crate trained
   at one time or another. Every dog needs a place to escape to, a place
   to call his own, and a crate provides an answer to these needs! Your
   new Chessie will have some degree of separation anxiety when you leave
   him for work or alone at home. Crating the dog in the beginning will
   eliminate accidents, chewing destruction, and other mischievous
   activity that is rooted in nervousness and insecurity. Your dog is
   safest in the crate when you are not home until you can totally trust
   him loose in the house. This is especially true if you have resident
   pets because you can't supervise their interactions when you're away
   or asleep! Children should be taught to leave the dog alone if he
   retreats to his crate. You should never use the crate for
   disciplining. The crate must be a dog's sanctuary for crate training
   to be effective. Crates are great for traveling with your dog later -
   the dog will always have a familiar den to retreat to and feel
   comfortable and reassured.

   <p>Each time your dog is confined, make sure the dog knows she's a good
   girl. If the Chessie is particularly emotional or anxious, try making
   good byes and hellos as unemotional & nonchalant as possible.

   <p>While crating a dog helps make everybody safe, crating should NOT be
   abused by locking the dog in the crate all the time. Chessies need to
   be with you and should be with you unless they cannot be supervised or
   trusted alone in the house. For instance, if you are going to shower
   and the dog still sometimes chews, crate him for those 15 minutes for
   safety, but then let him out to be with you. If the dog is crated
   while you are work all day - you MUST make an extra effort to let the
   dog "hang" with you in the house until he is reliable loose in the
   house.

   <p>If you prefer not to crate, make sure to set aside a safe,
   indestructible space in your home for your rescue dog. You may want to
   try using baby gates in the kitchen or hallway. Remember, you may
   really want to keep your dog on easy cleanup flooring at first!! If
   the area of confinement is too large, you may begin to have
   housebreaking accidents. We do not recommend the basement or garage,
   since your dog will not feel "part of the family" isolated away from
   it. If he can see and hear you, much the better. This is why wire
   style crates are so effective in the house.

   <h>BE PATIENT DURING THE HONEYMOON PERIOD!
   <p>There is a good chance that your rescued Chessie will show his
   insecurity by following you everywhere! This will include trying to
   hang with you in the bathroom, watching TV with you, getting the mail,
   and undoubtedly wanting to sleep with you. It is not unusual for him
   to whine or cry or bark if confined away from you at night - lights
   out at a new strange place is a stressful thing for him. If you put
   the crate close to your bedroom or somewhere he can see you, the
   problems are usually minimized. Safe chew toys in the crate at night
   will give him something to do if he's awake. Remember, during the
   first couple of weeks, the dog will probably get quite tired and worn
   out by the day's activities, so establishing a sleep schedule is
   usually not a big deal. As you wean him from the crating at night,
   make sure he has been well exercised - a tired Chessie is usually a
   really good Chessie indoors!!

   <h>ESTABLISH A ROUTINE!
   <p>Try to develop and use a consistent daily routine for feeding,
   exercising, and bathroom duties. Dogs are creatures of habit and
   routine translates into security for them. If you do the same things
   in the same way and in the same order, he will settle in more quickly
   and learn what is expected of him and when.

   <p>Let your new Chessie out to air and take care of business as soon as
   you rise in the mornings. Feed him after a short walk or romp in the
   yard. Give him another chance to relieve himself before you go to
   work. Upon return from work, immediately let the dog out for exercise
   and bathroom break (this is NOT the time to read the mail, make a
   phone call or flop yourself on the sofa!!!). If he's exercised
   heavily, wait 30 minutes or so before the evening feeding. He'll need
   another bathroom break anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours after
   the evening meal, depending on his age - it'll be your job to figure
   this out. He should get another airing right before you go to bed.

   <h>SOCIALIZE YOUR RESCUED CHESSIE!
   <p>Rescue dogs come from a variety of backgrounds, but all dogs can do
   with more socialization. After your dog has time to settle in your
   home and is starting to look to you with confidence (2-3 weeks), start
   providing new socialization opportunities.

   <p>Now you can start inviting your friends and relatives over. Do
   introductions to new people gradually. Introductions can take the form
   of petting, playing fetch, even going for a walk. Do not force the dog
   to accept new people - do it positively, with lots of praise, allowing
   the dog to approach people rather than new people approaching your
   dog!!! Be sure to tell your visitors that your dog is new from rescue
   so they need to be more sensitive. Don't reach for the dog right away
   - let him come to them. If he does not go to the new person, that
   visitor should completely ignore the dog. Suggest after the dog has
   met/sniffed the new person that they pat the side of the dog's neck or
   side of the shoulder instead. Patting a dog on the top of the head is
   interpreted by dogs as a powerful dominance attempt and can be a
   challenge to some dogs, a frightening thing to others.

   <p>Start taking your dog new places - nearby parks, dog-allowed beaches -
   and, especially to obedience classes! The opportunity will allow you
   to determine how your dog responds to strange people, dogs and places.

   <h>LOVE AND ENJOY YOUR NEW DOG!!

   <p>Authority without domination.
   Love without subservience.
   Respect without fear.

   <p>This is an adage used by workers in GSD rescue. It is appropriate for
   rescued Chessies, too, and we'd like people to think about it as they
   live with and train their rescue dogs. You do not need to frighten you
   dog into complying with household obedience commands, or prove to him
   that you are the toughest creature around by using constant brute
   force. You DO need to show your dog that you are the leader in the
   household, a leader he should put his trust in following. You can do
   this by "telling" your dog this in a language he understands - body
   language and daily habits. Respect is not something that you can force
   a creature into giving you.

   <p>Above all, be patient, firm and consistent with your new Chessie. Use
   positive reinforcement and lots of praise when she's good. When
   mistakes are made, correct her when it's happening, and praise her
   when she modifies her behavior. Undoubtedly you will get lots of
   advice - good and bad - from other dog owners! Read and research as
   much as you can to prepare yourself. Understand that sometimes you may
   need to try more than one approach to a problem because every Chessie
   is different. Most rescue and adoption coordinators will follow-up on
   the dogs they place. Most rescuers are backed up by dog behavior and
   health experts within their own local organization, so if they don't
   know the answer to a problem, they can ask others. Don't be afraid to
   ask questions, bring up new situations, and feelings of frustration
   that you may have! Our goal is to make sure rescue dogs never have to
   be uprooted again, so we are quite interested in helping you
   troubleshoot any problems - the sooner the better before they become
   big problems that threaten the placement!

   <p>Most of all, be prepared to give and receive more love, affection and
   loyalty than you ever thought possible! Enjoy your brown dog for many
   years to come and thanks again for helping us rescue Chessies!
