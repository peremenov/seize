<h>Iraq: No-Drive Zone During Voting?

<p>Gov't May Ban Private Vehicles For 3 Days To Curb Car Bombing Odds


   <p>Jan. 15, 2005 


   <p>(CBS/AP) Iraqi officials said Saturday they are considering new
   measures to protect voters in the Jan. 30 national election, including
   a three-day, nationwide ban on driving to discourage car-bombings.
   <p>Fresh clashes broke out in the troubled northern city of Mosul, where
   most election officials have fled their jobs in fear. A U.S. military
   helicopter made an emergency landing in Mosul after drawing ground
   fire, the U.S. command said.
   <p>Also, a U.S. Marine was killed in action Saturday in a tense area just
   south of Baghdad; the U.S. military claimed insurgents are being aided
   by former Saddam Hussein loyalists now in Syria; and leading Shiite
   politicians tried to dispel fears they would impose an Iranian-style
   clerical regime and appealed to Sunnis to participate in balloting.
   <p>U.S. and Iraqi officials fear a surge in insurgent attacks as the
   election approaches. Many members of the Sunni Arab minority are
   expected to boycott the balloting, and Sunni rebel groups have
   threatened to attack polling stations.
   <p>To prevent that, an Iraqi Cabinet minister told reporters that
   authorities are considering a number of special measures, including
   restrictions on the movement of private vehicles, and possible
   security cordons around polling stations.
   <p>Provincial Affairs minister Waeil Abdel-Latif gave no details about
   the proposed restrictions, but security officials said they included
   banning all private vehicle traffic across the country for three days
   around the election. That would make it easier to spot would-be
   vehicle bombers and to inhibit rebel movements.
   <p>"The government is determined to make available facilities and
   security guarantees to ensure the success of the election,"
   Abdel-Latif said.
   <p>In other developments:

     <l>Army Spc. Charles Graner Jr., the suspected ringleader of abuse at
   the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, took the stand for the first time
   Saturday and said he was ordered by interrogators to physically
   mistreat and sexually humiliate prisoners. Speaking a day after his
   conviction for the abuse, Graner described himself as a by-the-book
   prison guard who was corrupted by superiors.

     <l>Three mortar shells exploded Saturday near Baghdad's heavily guarded
   Green Zone, causing no casualties but sending American and Iraqi
   officials scurrying for cover. It marked the third straight day of
   rebel attacks on the Green Zone, the nerve center of the U.S. and
   Iraqi administration, after a lull of a couple of weeks.

     <l>A roadside bomb ripped through a U.S. convoy Saturday on the western
   edge of Baghdad, destroying a truck, police Lt. Akram al-Zubaie said.
   There were no reports of casualties.

     <l>U.S. troops arrested six suspected insurgents, including a former
   Iraqi general, in raids around Baghdad early Saturday, U.S. officials
   said. The general, who was not identified, was suspected of planning
   insurgent attacks.
   <p>Underscoring the security threat, fresh clashes broke out Saturday in
   the troubled northern city of Mosul between U.S. troops and
   insurgents, after the rebels blasted an American convoy.
   <p>After the blast, insurgents opened fire on American troops, who then
   raided a nearby agricultural research station looking for the
   assailants.
   <p>A U.S. Army OH58 Kiowa helicopter made an emergency landing in Mosul,
   Iraq's third-largest city, after receiving ground fire. The two crew
   members escaped injury, the command said.
   <p>In Baghdad, Brig. Gen. Carter Ham, the U.S. general responsible for
   security in northern Iraq, said that virtually every election worker
   in Ninevah province, which includes Mosul, quit recently because of
   security fears.
   <p>Ham said a new election coordinator was scrambling to find workers
   with about two weeks left before the election and that staffers may
   have to be sent there from other parts of the country.
   <p>"To tell you the truth, we don't know how many staff there actually
   were," he told reporters. "But we know that at one point, there were
   essentially none left."
   <p>Ham also said there were indications that insurgents were getting
   support from Iraqis who fled to Syria, about 70 miles west of Mosul,
   after Saddam's regime collapsed.
   <p>"There are some indications, clearly, that the insurgency is receiving
   some support from former regime forces that are based in Syria," Ham
   said, echoing allegations by Iraqi officials.
   <p>Security fears and opposition within the Sunni community have led to
   calls by some Sunni politicians to delay the election, a proposal
   strongly rejected by the U.S. administration and the country's
   powerful Shiite clerical hierarchy.
   <p>Iraqis will choose a 275-member parliament as well as provincial
   administrations. Voters in the Kurdish autonomous region will also
   select a new regional parliament.
   <p>However, U.S. and Iraqi officials fear that a low Sunni turnout could
   cast doubt on the new government's legitimacy. Many Sunni Arabs, who
   make up an estimated 20 percent of Iraq's nearly 26 million people,
   fear a loss of political power to the Shiites an estimated 60 percent
   of the population.
   <p>During a press conference Saturday, leading Shiite politicians sought
   to dispel fears they would impose an Iranian-style clerical regime and
   appealed to Sunnis to participate in balloting.
   <p>"The issue is who do you want to obey Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden
   ... or the Iraqi people," said Mouwaffaq al-Rubaie, the government's
   national security adviser. "There is no intention or plan to form an
   Islamic or religious state in Iraq ... or an Iranian style
   government."
   <p>Shiite candidate Ahmad Chalabi, once the Pentagon's choice to rule
   Iraq, said he planned to meet with Sunni leaders to encourage them to
   vote.
   <p>"I believe that this impression that the Sunnis will not vote will be
   dispelled quickly," he said. "They will vote."
   <p>In another development Saturday, the Defense Ministry confirmed a
   report in a major Arabic daily that an Iraqi woman trained by members
   of Saddam's regime in Syria tried to assassinate the defense minister
   but fainted before carrying out her mission.
   <p>Al Hayat newspaper quoted Defense Minister Hazem Shaalan as saying the
   assassination attempt took place in his Baghdad office more than a
   week ago.
   <p>Shaalan told the newspaper that the woman, who is about 40, entered
   the ministry claiming she wanted to deliver important security
   information.
   <p>"As she was sitting in the presence of several officials from the
   ministry, she surprised everyone by taking out a pistol she was
   carrying and pointed it at me from a distance of about one meter, but
   in the last moment she collapsed and started crying," he was quoted as
   saying.
