   <h>Teamwork Vs. Teams
   <p>Teamwork and teams have been buzzwords for about a decade. Many
   organizations want to hook onto the "team" train. Teams are great - in
   the right circumstances. Teamwork is expected. However, there is a
   difference. Teams are a noun or the "what". Teamwork is an adjective
   or the "how" or the process. Establishing teams and teamwork first
   comes with understanding of what they are and in what situations they
   can be effective. Join this workshop to find out whether teams and
   teamwork are right for you and your company. Topics include: -
   understanding the difference between teams and teamwork - applying
   teamwork principles - when and when not to establish teams - effective
   team characteristics - why teams succeed and why they fail
