   <h>Opinion on blood transfusion with reference to not making commercial
   use of the human body

   <p>N°28 - December 2, 1991


<h>Opinion

   <p>The National Consultative Ethics Committee established its position on
   this issue in the presentation of the initial work of the Group
   "Ethics and money" :

   <p>"When it is said that the human body is not for sale and not on the
   market, the two statements are complementary : on the one hand, the
   human body or one of its components cannot be the object of a
   contract, one the other hand, it cannot be negotiated by anyone". 

   <p>The Committee re-asserts this principle, which must apply to both the
   human body as a whole and to organs and components.

   <p>As regards blood donation and more generally the French transfusion
   system, the Committee reiterates its endorsement of the fundamental
   values which inspired the system :

   <l> voluntary unpaid donation 

   <l> non-profit for subsequent operations

   <l> dignity of the donor

   <l> interests of the patient.

   <p>A reorganisation of structures is necessary but must continue to be
   based on these principles, and must also take into account all the
   objectives : safe collection and distribution of products, sober and
   reasonable economic use, capacity to finance research and investments.
   These principles entail total transparency and strict supervision of
   the use of funds for scientific work and for day to day operations.

   <p>Developments in European economic co-operation should not compromise
   these principles.

   <p>In this respect, a directive by the Council of European Communities,
   dated 14th June, 1989, which calls blood and human plasma " raw
   materials " and blood components " pharmaceutical items " would seem
   to include these products of the body into the commercial circuit.
   This interpretation of the document should not take precedence over
   the principles recalled above.

   <p>Purchasing blood and plasma as one would buy a raw material and
   selling plasma derivatives, would be a negation of the above
   principles.

   <p>Any concession, on the pretext that blood is a renewable tissue and
   that limited donation cannot be harmful, would transgress the rule
   which ensures that human dignity is respected. Once blood has become a
   commercial item, all other tissues and organs could go the same way.

   <p>In Europe a major effort is in progress to bring nations closer
   together, in particular economically. The Council of Ministers of the
   Council of Europe, when it adopted recommendation n° R-90-9 of 29th
   March, 1990 which states " for reasons both ethical and clinical,
   blood donation should be voluntary and should not give rise to
   remuneration ", is in fact taking a different direction.

   <p>The National Consultative Ethics Committee thereby finds reason to
   declare that unification will not be achieved successfully, and
   therefore the ideal of arriving at harmonisation will not be attained,
   if solely economic interests are taken account of, without any
   reference to the ethical values which this Opinion reaffirms.

   <h>Report

   <p>Blood transfusion has been for a long time one of the National
   Consultative Ethics Committee's particular preoccupations. The subject has just sprung to the foreground of
   national concerns in dramatic circumstances. This report comes
   therefore at a time when there is coincidence between action based on
   a principle and the testing of that principle by current events.

   <p>Early in 1990, our Committee embarked on an in depth study on the
   theme of "Ethics and Money", the pertinence of which never ceases to
   be patent in most of the matters we are asked to consider. As a first
   step in this long term consideration of the matter, in the " Journées
   Nationales d'Ethique " in December 1990, the Committee re-affirmed the
   fundamental principle of not making commercial use of the human body.
   Since that time, work has progressed. One of the subjects which we
   feel we have completed our consideration of, and which will be one of
   the major components of the final report, is blood transfusion. As of
   now, it can be the subject of a report and a firm Opinion.

   <p>France played a leading role in the development of blood transfusion.
   The first transfusions, the first Transfusion Centre (Saint-Antoine,
   1929), the first organised transfusion system on a national scale, all
   took place in our country. Furthermore, as early as 1950, the
   principle of unpaid blood donation was adopted and made the French
   system an internationally recognised ethical model.

   <p>And yet, that which seemed to have been established once and for all
   is challenged in a time of crisis, with consequences that may turn out
   to be very serious or perhaps irreparable.

   <p>There is a dual aspect to this crisis. The first, which has been the
   subject of much discussion and comment, is a loss of faith. The
   discovery that hundreds of haemophiliacs were contaminated by the AIDS
   virus at a time when effective decontamination of anti-haemophilic
   products had not become generalised, i.e. before mid-1985, provoked
   consternation with which we entirely sympathise. Queries, criticism,
   and doubts abound. Who bears responsibility or, in some cases blame,
   during this period ? Changes in outlook since that time, brought about
   by an enormous accumulation of recently acquired knowledge,
   complicates the task of judging with hindsight and taking into account
   scientific uncertainties and technological hesitations of a period now
   past. The courts will have the task of throwing all possible light on
   this distressing issue, as devastated families and loved ones
   justifiably demand, and making whatever reparation they may be
   entitled to.

   <p>We have neither authority to intervene in such procedures, nor any
   inclination to do so.

   <p>The second aspect of the present crisis, less apparent perhaps to
   public opinion, is in fact of much greater scope and gravity. We refer
   to the fact that the principles of the system as a whole are
   questioned, and that these principles are viewed in a equivocal light
   although they are in no way involved in the calamitous events before
   1985. Our mission does not qualify us to evaluate the failings of the
   system or of its structures, or their causes nor who is to be held
   responsible. But this mission definitely empowers us to make a firm
   ethical stand upholding those principles which are : absence of gain,
   and banning commercial use of the human body.

   <p>Changes which have been introduced in the last few years in the Centre
   National pour la Transfusion Sanguine (National Blood Transfusion
   Centre) could, if they were to persist, gravely imperil the ethical
   principles which are at the root of the remarkable and original
   qualities of the system as a whole.

   <p>These changes were brought about by revolutionary technical
   modifications to the process of blood transfusion. Traditionally,
   transfusion was a direct transfer of whole blood, but has now evolved
   so that elective use is made of the various components of blood and
   plasma, according to the patient's specific needs. In this way,
   processes of an almost industrial nature have appeared such as
   industrial extraction and preparation of stabilised products for
   therapeutic purposes. This dual evolution has led in some countries,
   the United States in particular, to a pharmaceutical statute for the
   institutions preparing the products. Industrial logic leads to a
   commercialisation of the whole process, blood is bought, and its
   components are sold, after preparation.

   <p>The risk of this kind of development in France is all the less
   negligible since the European arrangements which will become mandatory
   in 1993 move in that direction.

   <p>There is danger for the future of our system in both of its aspects :
   unpaid blood donation, and the non-lucrative character of subsequent
   activities.

   <p>We have entered into an era of industrial logic : that cannot be
   avoided. We are now threatened by commercial logic : is it avoidable ?
   This is the fundamental question we wish to broach after considering :

   <l> developments in transfusion

   <l> features of the French system

    <l>European directives on blood and plasma, and their consequences.

   <h>Developments in transfusion 

   <p>The expression 'blood transfusion' now includes :

   <l>collection of whole blood or of plasma only (plasmapheresis) 

   <l>separation of the blood components : on one hand, cellular components
   - red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets; on the other
   hand, plasma derivatives obtained by fractionation 

   <l>reinjection of whole blood very rarely, usually only one or other of
   its components, depending on the patient's need. 

   <p>The increasing complexity of transfusion techniques is due to
   technical progress and to new indications.

   <h>Technical progress 

   <p>A bloodless human dies. This obvious fact led a very long time ago to
   the concept of transfusion. After very disappointing early attempts
   with animal blood, the use of human blood at the end of the 19th
   century raised hopes. They were frequently dashed, however, by
   inexplicable failures.

   <p>They remained unexplained until Landsteiner, in 1900, discovered that
   all human blood was not identical - neither identical nor, worse
   still, compatible. An essential breakthrough was the discovery of the
   first three human blood groups, A, O, B, which are the most important
   from the point of view of compatibility.

   <p>This decisive step forward and the needs engendered by World War I
   triggered early applications. At the time, transfusion was direct from
   arm to arm. After the war, various devices greatly facilitated the
   procedure.

   <p>In 1929, Arnault Tzanck, who had been one of the pioneers of the
   technique, founded the first blood transfusion centre in Paris, at the
   hospital Saint-Antoine. Physicians and donors were on standby around
   the clock so as to be able to respond to any emergency in all of the
   Paris hospitals. This was the first transfusion system.

   <p>World War II brought further progress : the preservation of blood.
   Blood could be stabilised and stored for several days for transport
   and used elsewhere, at a later time. Moreover, it could be checked
   biologically before use.

   <p>After the war, blood transfusion centres were established in the major
   hospitals. Some of them began to use separation techniques so that
   blood cells and plasma could be used separately.

   <p>This developed in response to an increase in demand, i.e. in
   indications.

   <h> Development of indications and industrialisation of plasmatic
   fractionation 

   <p>Initially designed to correct a partial loss of blood volume,
   transfusion was in the beginning an injection of whole blood. The only
   indication at the time, haemorrhage, seemed to logically call for this
   kind of global compensation. However, progress in the technology of
   resuscitation during World War II, revealed that the most threatening
   characteristic of a haemorrhage is a collapse of circulation due to a
   drop in blood volume. The idea was born of replacing as a priority the
   missing volume with plasma only, if necessary. Plasma, once separated
   from blood cells can be easily stored and preserved. The advantage
   therefore is greater availability. Once blood volume has been
   restored, the loss of red blood cells has to be compensated, but it is
   then only necessary to inject cells in the concentrated form which is
   the result of fractionation. Thus, the concept of selective
   transfusion began to emerge in the 1960s.

   <p>In parallel, indications multiplied and ceased to be purely surgical.
   Clinical indications included correcting anemias, white blood cell and
   platelet deficiencies, or a lack of certain plasma components such as
   clotting factors.

   <p>In each of these cases, it seemed logical to inject only the missing
   component. Furthermore, selective transfusion saves blood. Various
   therapeutic products can be derived from the same blood donation.

   <p>The development of techniques for separating blood into cells and
   plasma and then isolating the component proteins of plasma, a process
   which is called plasma fractionation, naturally ensued.

   <p>These separation techniques give rise to two kind of products :

   <l>cellular components (labile products) which cannot be stored for any
   great length of time :a few weeks for red blood cells, and only a few
   days for white blood cells and platelets. 

   <l>plasmatic fractions, which are much more stable and can be stored for
   months or even years. 

   <p>Equipment required for each of these two kinds of procedures varies
   considerably. Production of labile products does not require any very
   complex equipment. It can be done by most blood transfusion centres.
   Plasma fractionation, however, requires complex machinery. You could
   say that labile products can be prepared in an unsophisticated
   environment, processed and used in unit form, but with all the
   problems of verifying compatibility at the time they are used. On the
   contrary, stable products fall into the category of industrial
   processes in batches of several thousands of litres of plasma. These
   products are standardised and can be used by anyone following
   prescriptions for indications and general administrative procedures.

   <p>The development of plasma fractionation activities has led to the
   creation of industrial facilities processing plasma in gigantic
   quantities : several hundreds of thousands of litres a year.

   <p>Initially, plasma was the result of separation of the cell components
   from whole blood; it was a kind of "by-product" of the preparation of
   labile products by blood transfusion centres. But as the growth of
   demand for stable fractions outpaced the growth of demand for labile
   products, the result was selective collection. Certain machines can,
   during the collection of blood from a donor, separate the cellular
   components which are re-injected, and keep only the plasma. This is
   called plasmapheresis and allows for collection of larger and much
   more frequent donations than is the case with whole blood.

   <p>In this way, and particularly in certain countries, an independent
   plasma industry has evolved which closely resembles the pharmaceutical
   industry.

   <h> Developments in transfusion in other countries 

   <p>We are not attempting to give an overall view of transfusion world
   wide. We simply wish to give an impression of the diversity that
   exists using a few examples which will help to understand the
   specificity and harmony of the French system which will be described
   below.

   <p>The United States are a special case for a variety of reasons.
   Firstly, because there are two types of transfusion centres, those run
   by the Red Cross, and others with widely differing statutes. Only the
   first category apply the ethical principles of non payment of donors,
   and non-profit for the centre. But the major specific characteristic
   of the country is the enormous development of a plasma industry run by
   a few large companies along commercial lines. They buy the plasma
   obtained by plasmapheresis and sell the fractions in the same way as
   medicinal drugs (they may also sell the non processed plasma as a "
   raw material " to fractionating centres, even in Europe as we shall
   see). As these companies are very dynamic they produce quantities far
   higher than are needed on the American home market (needs are
   evaluated at about 3 000 000 litres of plasma whereas about 9 000 000
   litres are drawn). As a result, they export a great deal of their
   production at prices which on the whole are significantly lower than
   those practised by fractionating centres using donated plasma. This is
   because as "donors" are paid, conditions are imposed on them which
   ensure better productivity from the plasmapheresis machines and blood
   centre staff.

   <p>For a long time, Japan imported blood products from the United States
   for two reasons : essentially because not enough blood was collected,
   but even more because consumption was excessive, particularly of
   plasmatic products. However, contamination of haemophiliacs by the
   AIDS virus at a time when the country was virtually free of sexual
   contamination, led to a radical change of policy.

   <p>Self-sufficiency based on voluntary donation and a slowing down of
   consumption is not far off, which is beginning to worry American
   exporters and incite them to turn their eyes in the direction of
   Europe.

   <p>European transfusion centres differ notably in the way they are
   organised and their degree of efficiency. The French system with
   centres as part of a public service exercising a monopoly is an
   exception. In certain countries, such as Belgium, Holland, and
   Denmark, the Red Cross is in charge of organising blood transfusion
   and sees to it that the rules of unpaid donation and absence of profit
   are respected. However, in certain countries, Germany in particular,
   paying the donor is not prohibited. Another particularity of the
   country, is that Germany consumes vast quantities of plasma, albumin,
   and antihemophilic factors, and therefore imports large volumes of
   American plasma (800 000 litres annually). Globally, Europe just about
   satisfies its domestic market for labile products. For plasmatic
   products however, it must import abundant quantities either as plasma,
   or as finished products.

   <h> Transfusion in the future 

   <p>In France and in most countries with the same level of health care
   development, there is a levelling off of blood and blood product
   consumption. It would not be unreasonable to expect a downturn in the
   next few years. Several reasons may be involved.

   <p>Firstly, as a consequence of HIV contamination, there is increasing
   awareness of the risk of infection, viral infection in particular.
   Even when they are identified and can be detected, there is always a
   residual risk (at present, the risk of HIV transmission is estimated
   at 1 in 100.000 to 1 in 200.000 transfusions). But more menacing is
   the risk of new infections for which there is bound to be a lag before
   preventive measures are applied.

   <p>At first, only the medical profession was apprehensive about
   transfusion risks, but the general public is also becoming wary. Such
   fears are going to be the most powerful agents for reducing
   consumption which had reached in some cases excessive levels.

   <p>Apart from a more selective choice of indications, another trend is to
   find new methods to either replace blood with artificial substances
   (as we have seen previously, plasma substitutes to replace blood
   volume), or to use the patient's own blood for a transfusion instead
   of blood supplied by a donor. This is called autologous donation and
   is used in elective surgery when it is possible to predict some time
   in advance that transfusion will be needed.

   <p>Plasmatic fractions are likely to modify to the greatest extent the
   present situation. They are pure proteins, clearly identified and it
   is thought there could be hopes of creating them by genetic
   engineering. Two American firms have already manufactured a factor
   VIII which is out of the experimental stage and awaiting approval. The
   French National Transfusion Centre is also working on a factor VIII
   but is a little less advanced. Requirements for plasmatic factor VIII,
   which was the component which conditioned the level of plasma
   consumption, should take a sharp downward turn over the next few
   years. The same should apply to albumin which has been synthesised by
   several genetic engineering processes. Finally, another project of the
   National Transfusion Centre is to manufacture an anti-D immunoglobulin
   to be used clinically to prevent Rhesus immunisation.

   <p>Therefore, over the next decade, there should be a complete reversal
   of the situation regarding plasmatic proteins. However, the need for
   red blood cells, and even more for leukocytes and platelets are
   nowhere near to being satisfied by anything but blood donation.

   <h> The French transfusion system 

   <h> Particularities 

   <p>The French transfusion system has some distinctive ethical and
   organisational features. After a short period of time after the war
   when donors received financial compensation, partly justified by the
   need to travel urgently demanded by the direct transfusion method,
   voluntary donation became the rule. Deferred transfusion made possible
   by techniques to preserve blood helped to achieve this, and also
   anonymity.

   <p>Donation free of charge introduced by the pioneers of transfusion,
   both medical staff and donors, later influenced the whole organisation
   of the transfusion system.

   <p>In 1952, a law was passed setting up the transfusion system which
   includes Departmental Centres (one for each département (French
   administrative areas), Regional Centres (a total of 16) and the
   National Centre which also takes on certain special tasks in education
   and research.

   <p>Some Regional Centres and, of course, the National Centre, have
   developed industrial activities for the fractionation of plasma (a
   total of 7 centres).

   <p>This system has the monopoly of collecting, preparing, and
   distributing blood and all its derivatives. As a logical follow-up to
   non lucrative donation, non profit making is mandatory. This is
   implemented through the setting of a "disposal" price (and not a sales
   price) for each of the products, by the government department in
   charge.

   <p>In this way, although the Centres do not all have the same legal
   status (some are hospital-based or community-based, and in some cases
   they are associations) but all together render a public service.

   <p>Another special feature of the French system is the role played by
   donors. They are members of associations which group together at
   national level to form the French Federation of Voluntary Blood Donors
   (Fédération Française des Donneurs de Sang Bénévoles). Donor
   associations at community level and the Federation at national level
   cooperate with blood transfusion establishments, specially for the
   purpose of promoting blood donation. The esteem and gratitude owed to
   the voluntary donor is apparent in the partnership statute conferred
   on him.

   <h>Evolution of the system 

   <p>The system has had to adapt to the constant increase in demand.. It
   now collects approximately 4 million donations a year. This is
   entirely sufficient for labile products, and almost enough to satisfy
   demand for stable products. For the first time, in the last two years,
   fortunately limited quantities of plasma have had to be imported.

   <p>Adapting to the growth in demand has required efforts from all the
   Centres, and more particularly the fractionation Centres who in recent
   years have developed quasi industrial facilities to prepare the
   various fractions and process about 1 million litres of plasma a year.
   Yield efficiencies (extraction rate of the various proteins) have been
   improved constantly. The best performances are on a par with state of
   the art technology. It is worth noting that if all the fractionation
   Centres had attained that level, imports would not have been necessary
   in the last two years.

   <p>The National Blood Transfusion Centre has played a leading role in
   this evolution. Its educational activities in transfusion (most
   transfusion specialists are trained there), and research activities
   (work conducted by Professor Salmon enjoys international recognition)
   are worthy of note. The greatest effort however has been in the field
   of plasma fractionation and a powerful industrial tool is in the
   making.

   <p>Wishing to make the best use of this industrial capacity, the
   management have created in the past two years a joint stock company
   grouping a network of commercial subsidiaries, called Espace Vie .

   <p>The creation of Espace Vie has been described as necessary to adapt to
   pharmaceutical status developments which are said to be inevitable in
   the light of European regulations which will be studied below.

   <p>There is no denying, however, that creating a group of commercial
   subsidiaries could risk gravely tarnishing the altruistic image of the
   transfusion system. There is a potential source of flagrant
   contradiction of the non-profit principle of an organisation which
   must be entirely devoted to the sole interests of the patient and
   respect for the spirit of generosity of which the first example is set
   by donors.

   <p>Donor associations and quite a few physicians working in the
   transfusion centres did not entirely approve the move. Furthermore,
   excessive financial commitments compromised the economic balance of
   the National Centre.

   <p>The governmental authorities in charge of the Centres, became aware of
   the grave consequences of the move and are studying the matter in
   preparation for further action.

   <p>It is clear that the study must consider mainly the National Blood
   Transfusion Centre because of the change in its structures, but must
   also extend to a consideration of the whole French transfusion system
   particularly in the light of the implications of the European
   directive on blood and derivatives.

   <h>The European directive on blood and its consequences 

   <p>The Council of European Communities approved directive N° 89-381 on
   14th June 1989, "setting up special arrangements for medication
   derived from human blood and plasma".

   <p>The essential point in this directive is that it confers the status of
   medicinal items to plasma derivatives. It hopes that States will
   achieve self-sufficiency using non paid donors, but it does not
   prohibit paid plasma from being imported, it does not demand
   non-profit status for the fractionation facilities which may be part
   of the private sector, and it provides for commercial distribution of
   the products.

   <p>The economic inspiration of this directive which aims to allow free
   circulation and production of "medication derived from human blood and
   plasma" outranks very clearly ethical considerations which take second
   place.

   <p>If the European Directive is implemented, there would be serious
   repercussions on: 

   <l> ethics,

   <l> the present transfusion system,

   <l> public health,

   <l> society.

   <h> Ethical repercussions 

   <p>Accepting the possibility of buying blood and plasma as a "raw
   material", and commercial sale of processed products, is above all, a
   denial of a fundamental principle of our legal system, i.e. refraining
   from making commercial use of the human body.

   <p>Quite recently, our Committee, when it presented the initial work of
   the Group "Ethics and money" recalled our attachment to this principle
   : "When it is said that the human body is not for sale and not on the
   market, the two statements are complementary : on the one hand, the
   human body or one of its components cannot be the object of a
   contract, one the other hand, it cannot be negotiated by anyone". 

   <p>Any concession, on the pretext that blood is a renewable tissue and
   that limited donation cannot be harmful, would transgress the rule
   which ensures that human dignity is respected. Once blood has become a
   commercial item, all other tissues and organs could go the same way.

   <p>We point out that our refusal should start with the rejection of
   wording such as " raw material " to designate blood and plasma, and "
   medication " to describe products prepared by processing blood and
   plasma.

   <p>The terminology, which is in itself alienating, opens the way to a
   deviation of concepts, principles, and practices.

   <p>However, in order to ensure maximum safety, it is advisable that all
   the guarantees which attach to the status of pharmaceutical items
   should be strictly applied to blood derivatives, which does not
   however confer on them the status of medication as such.

   <h> Consequences for the present transfusion system 

   <p>The French transfusion system is based on a law passed in 1952 which
   set up a co-ordinated set of departmental, regional, and national
   Centres.

   <p>Together, they render a public service to which was given the monopoly
   for collecting blood, preparing derivatives, and distributing blood
   and components.

   <p>If the European Directive is implemented, this system will face
   threefold competition from the major commercial companies :

   <l>the companies could set up fractionation units in France,

   <l>they could buy plasma abroad, at a lower cost price than donated
   plasma,

   <l>they could, either through these units, or through their manufacturing
   facilities abroad, market lower priced products for two reasons.
   Firstly, because of the lower cost of the plasma, but also because
   they do not have to bear the cost of supplying the labile fractions.
   Commercial firms concentrate on the sole profitable side of the
   business, i.e. stable products. The labile sector is more difficult to
   manage and to run profitably. It would remain the responsibility of
   the national transfusion system, thereby increasing the deficit. But
   the most threatening outcome concerns voluntary donors who would cease
   to feel concerned if the principle of voluntary donation was dropped.
   They have made this sentiment known through their associations.

   <p>Altogether, the entire transfusion system as it is today would very
   soon be endangered and made incapable of performing a task which is
   essential for public health.

   <p>A reorganisation of structures is necessary but must continue to be
   based on a renewed assertion of ethical principles, and must also take
   into account all the objectives : safe collection and distribution of
   products, sober and reasonable economic use, capacity to finance
   research and investments. These principles entail total transparency
   and strict supervision of the use of funds for scientific work and for
   day to day operations.

   <h>Consequences for public health 

   <p>Accepting that blood and plasma can be bought has further detrimental
   consequences for public health. It is obvious that in such
   transactions, there is a tendency to overstep the limits for volumes
   drawn which have been the rule for the sake of the donor's health.
   Both the collecting agency and the donor may be responsible for such
   abuses.

   <p>Also, the purchase of blood increases possible risks of contamination
   either by infectious agents, or by drugs, in two ways : there is a
   higher representation of the more deprived sectors of the population
   who are more exposed to risks of contamination of various kinds, and
   vendors are more likely to conceal risk factors.

   <p>Finally, in a system entirely governed by the law of the market,
   consumption might be encouraged even for marginal or aberrant
   indications. On the contrary, the unpaid character of the donation
   obliges collection and distribution agents not just to respect the
   non-profitable nature of the operation, but also sober and reasonable
   use, with a verification of indications, and a limitation, insofar as
   is possible, of the consumption of blood products which can be of
   immense therapeutic benefit, but nevertheless is not devoid of serious
   risk.

   <p>We recognise that the European Directive, by demanding therapeutic
   drug status which implies safeguards, and in particular checks and
   trials before a product is put on the market, seeks to give maximum
   protection. However, as we have already stated, it should be possible
   to demand identical safeguards without giving medication status.

  <h>Social consequences 

   <p>A free gift is part of a social concept of solidarity which is all the
   more unselfish because the gift is anonymous. The collecting agency,
   responsible for non-profitability and conscientious use, is the public
   medium for this notion of mutual help and the recipient is aware of
   the priceless value of what he has been given.

   <p>In this way, the transfusion system, as it was designed in France, is
   a creator of social bonds. A "market" system cannot be expected to
   produce such wholesome results. On the contrary, it would create
   inequalities and in particular incite preferential removal of
   substance from the more deprived section of the population.

   <p>The European Directive appears to be inspired above all by economic
   considerations to promote free trade within the Community, but brings
   with it, in exchange for very limited safeguarding improvements, so
   many risks for the purity of the ethical principles involved and the
   potency of our transfusion system that one may legitimately wonder
   whether it is compatible with ethical principles which are reasserted
   above.

   <p>This questioning of the medication status could for that matter be to
   some extent justified by a similar trend in the United States,
   although for very different motives. At the request of the commercial
   companies themselves, the medication status is about to be dropped.
   The reason is that the status implies a degree of security which
   cannot now, and probably not in the future, be totally guaranteed.
   Thus, liability for risks which are difficult to foresee and estimate
   are becoming increasingly troublesome to insure. For those reasons, in
   the United States the notion of "service" is reinstated for
   transfusion, implying for the manufacturer simply an obligation to use
   adequate means and approved practices.

   <p>It would be paradoxical if Europe where to adopt a solution which is
   contrary to its ethical principles and which even in purely economic
   terms, is highly risky.
