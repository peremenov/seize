<h>The Guinea Worm Eradication Effort: Lessons for the Future

   <p>The dracunculiasis (Guinea worm) eradication campaign has specific
   implications for efforts to control other emerging infectious
   diseases. Guinea worm, a painful disfiguring disease, affects
   primarily adults, who often become ill in very large numbers (usually
   30% or more of a village's population) during the planting or harvest
   season. The disease used to be transmitted in parts of Asia and in
   Africa in open standing stagnant water. The intermediate host of the
   parasite, the copepod, contains the larva of the worm in such open
   drinking water; these organisms are barely visible in a glass of
   drinking water held up to the light. Thirteen years ago, the disease
   was still endemic in parts of the Indian subcontinent, a small part of
   Pakistan and India, Yemen, and the band of countries across Africa
   from east to west.

  <h>The Guinea Worm Eradication Campaign

   <p>Several interventions have been used to end transmission of Guinea
   worm disease: health education (teaching people to filter their water
   through a finely woven cloth and not to enter water when they or their
   neighbors are infectious), safe drinking water from such sources as
   underground borehole wells, and vector control (using Abate).

   <p>The Guinea worm campaign, like other campaigns in the past, has
   illustrated the importance of political mobilization, including the
   mobilization of national leaders. For example, General Amadou Toumani
   Tour√© (a charismatic former head of state of the Republic of Mali),
   with the encouragement of President Carter in 1992, made the
   eradication of Guinea worm disease in Mali and in the nine other
   French-speaking countries in West Africa his personal mission.

   <p>The campaign faces a problem common to many other efforts to control
   infectious diseases in the industrialized and the developing world:
   underreporting. For example, in Ghana, as in Nigeria 10 years ago, and
   in many other countries, only three or four thousand cases of Guinea
   worm disease were officially reported; but the actual numbers were
   much higher. In 1989 when Ghana conducted a nationwide
   village-by-village search, almost 180,000 cases were found. Sudan
   began its eradication program late because of civil war. In 1996 and
   1997, an apparent decline of cases in Sudan was due to less complete
   reporting because of increased fighting in 1997.

  <h>The Campaign's Implications for Other Diseases

   <p>The Guinea worm campaign has demonstrated very graphically the
   possibility of village-based monthly reporting in Africa. In Ghana and
   Nigeria at the beginning of this program 10 years ago, such reporting
   did not exist. Now in those countries, more than 6,000 disease-endemic
   villages have volunteers who report to the national capital monthly.

   <p>The Guinea worm campaign has also demonstrated very clearly the
   efficacy of health education. In the beginning, many were skeptical
   because Guinea worm could not be combated with a vaccine, and
   eradication efforts had to rely on behavior change. However, behavior
   has changed. While we have been successful in helping to bring safe
   drinking water to many disease-endemic villages, the fastest and most
   effective intervention has been health education, which helped people
   understand where the parasite was coming from, how they were being
   infected, and the importance of using cloth filters to protect
   themselves and their families.

   <p>The campaign has underscored the potential of local volunteers. Many
   years ago in the Americas, village volunteers were used as part of
   malaria control efforts. The onchocerciasis control program in Africa
   is also using village volunteers successfully. The Guinea worm
   campaign has been another illustration of how volunteers can be used
   to diagnose, report, and provide, in this instance, on-the-spot
   treatment to neighbors for a specific infection. Those responsible for
   the campaign's success are often not members of the general health
   services.

   <p>With the help of the World Bank, the Guinea worm campaign demonstrates
   the importance of disease eradication to the national economy. The
   World Bank has estimated that the economic rate of return on the
   investment in Guinea worm eradication will be on the order of 29% per
   year once the disease is eradicated. That figure is based on a very
   conservative estimate of the average amount of time infected workers
   are unable to perform agricultural tasks.

   <p>The campaign has also created a group of trained health-care workers
   of a different generation from those involved in the smallpox
   eradication program. These workers have gone from beginning to end,
   from hearing the doubters and seeing the difficulty of initiating the
   campaign to tasting victory in their own countries. These workers can
   contribute to subsequent campaigns. Moreover, the concept of
   eradication, which was in disrepute only 5, 10 years ago, has been
   revived. Soon we will confirm that a nonviral disease for which
   vaccine is not available can be eradicated.

   <p>Like the smallpox eradication campaign, the Guinea worm campaign has
   illustrated very vividly in many different ways and at many different
   levels (from international to village level) the power of data. In the
   Guinea worm campaign, we have used surveillance data to promote health
   policy. One key lesson from the smallpox campaign we are deliberately
   applying in the Guinea worm campaign is to distill what needs to be
   done in terms of interventions to a handful, or almost a handful, of
   indexes (seven on an international level) to know what is most
   important and (as rapidly as possible) how well we are doing. That
   unleashes inordinate amounts of energy.

   <p>Finally, the Guinea worm eradication campaign will have illustrated
   again the power of demonstration. Eradication can happen because it
   has happened.
