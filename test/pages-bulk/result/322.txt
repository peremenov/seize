   <h>Longitudinal Survey (PDF 200K)
   <p>The Youth Media Campaign Longitudinal Survey (YMCLS) is an annual
   national telephone survey of young people, ages 9 to 13 years, and
   their parents. Working with research corporation Westat, CDC designed
   the YMCLS to measure the physical activity-related beliefs, attitudes
   and behaviors of youth and their parents and to monitor youth exposure
   to the VERB campaign. Survey results guide the campaign's evolution
   and provide important information about the impact of the VERB
   campaign.

   <p>A Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing technique was used to
   administer the survey. The appearance and structure of the survey
   reflects the software that is used for survey delivery. The
   interviewer reads all of the text -- questions and response options --
   except for those in all capital letters. Words or phrases that are in
   all capital letters are automatically displayed to the interviewer and
   indicate possible coding options. Text in parentheses at the end of a
   response category indicates a skip pattern (e.g., GO TO S2).

   <p>We administered the first YMCLS (YMCLS 2002) during spring 2002 before
   the launch of the national VERB campaign, to provide the baseline for
   future studies. The baseline YMCLS 2002 was administered to more than
   3,000 9-13 year olds and their parents nationally.

   <h>Continuous Tracking Survey (PDF 265K).
   <p>The Continuous Tracking Survey is an ongoing survey that collects data
   from a sample of 9-13 year olds to better understand their impressions
   of the campaign and its messages. The survey provides campaign
   planners and brand strategists with information about how widely the
   campaign is being seen and how it is being understood. The appearance
   and format of the survey reflects the interview structure that is
   used.

   <h>VERB's Formative Research Process (PDF 150K)
   <p>This document describes the VERB campaign's concept and message
   testing qualitative methodology. It contains sample screening
   questionnaires and moderator guides.

   <h>Logic Model
   <p>Logic models are often developed for public health programs and
   campaigns. A logic model links campaign inputs and activities with
   campaign outcomes. The model can be used as a tool to:
    <l> Identify the short-term, intermediate, and long-term outcomes for
       the campaign;
    <l> Link those outcomes to each other and to campaign activities;
    <l> Select outcomes to measure depending on the stage of the
       campaign's development;
    <l> Show how it may take time before long-term outcomes can be
       associated with the campaign.
