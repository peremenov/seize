  <h>Greatest Hits CD
  
   <p>Personnel includes: Richard Marx, Luther Vandross, Lionel Richie
   (vocals). Producers: Richard Marx, David Cole, Humberto Gatica, Randy
   Jackson. Includes liner notes by Richard Marx. Although he began his
   career singing backup for musicians such as Lionel Richie and Madonna,
   Richard Marx made his mark on the pop music scene in 1987 with his hit
   single, "Don't Mean Nothing." Over the next ten years, Marx racked up
   thirteen top five singles and four multi-platinum albums; his biggest
   are included on GREATEST HITS, including familiar songs like "Hold
   Onto the Nights," the sweet ballad "Now and Forever," and the kicky,
   uptempo "Satisfied." Other standouts include "Angel's Lullaby," which
   was included on the Pediatric AIDS Foundation benefit cd, FOR OUR
   CHILDREN TOO, and which Marx wrote for his young sons: "I was never
   alive til the day I was blessed with you/I hold you late at
   night/Knowing what I was put here to do."

   <h>5 stars High Quality Collection
   <p>This is a great collection of songs from Marx. Since his 1987 debut,
   he has evolved over the years. From the first album, you get "Endless
   Summer Nights," "Hold On To The Nights" and "Should Have Known
   Better". There are good songs as well off his follow-up Repeat
   Offender as well as from Rush Street. His ballads are very powerful
   and hit any mood you may be in. He is also versatile and that he can
   rock, see "Satisfied" and "Take This Heart". This is a complete
   compilation of a talented artist with moving comments of each song's
   history.
