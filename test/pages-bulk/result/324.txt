<h>Aromaticity

                    <h>Benzene and Other Aromatic Compounds

   <p>The adjective "aromatic" is used by organic chemists in a rather
   different way than it is normally applied. It has its origin in the
   observation that certain natural substances, such as cinnamon bark,
   wintergreen leaves, vanilla beans and anise seeds, contained fragrant
   compounds having common but unexpected properties. Cinnamon bark, for
   example, yielded a pleasant smelling compound, formula C[9]H[8]O,
   named cinnamaldehyde. Because of the low hydrogen to carbon ratio in
   this and other aromatic compounds (note that the H:C ratio in an
   alkane is >2), chemists expected their structural formulas would
   contain a large number of double or triple bonds. Since double bonds
   are easily cleaved by oxidative reagents such as potassium
   permanganate or ozone, and rapidly add bromine and chlorine, these
   reactions were applied to these aromatic compounds. Surprisingly,
   products that appeared to retain many of the double bonds were
   obtained, and these compounds exhibited a high degree of chemical
   stability compared with known alkenes and cycloalkenes (aliphatic
   compounds). On treatment with hot permanganate solution,
   cinnamaldehyde gave a stable, crystalline C[7]H[6]O[2] compound, now
   called benzoic acid. The H:C ratio in benzoic acid is <1, again
   suggesting the presence of several double bonds. Benzoic acid was
   eventually converted to the stable hydrocarbon benzene, C[6]H[6],
   which also proved unreacive to common double bond transformations, as
   shown below. For comparison, reactions of cyclohexene, a typical
   alkene, with these reagents are also shown (green box). As
   experimental evidence for a wide assortment of compounds was acquired,
   those incorporating this exceptionally stable six-carbon core came to
   be called "aromatic".

   <p>   If benzene is forced to react by increasing the temperature and/or by
   addition of a catalyst, It undergoes substitution reactions rather
   than the addition reactions that are typical of alkenes. This further
   confirms the previous indication that the six-carbon benzene core is
   unusually stable to chemical modification. The conceptual
   contradiction presented by a high degree of unsaturation (low H:C
   ratio) and high chemical stability for benzene and related compounds
   remained an unsolved puzzle for many years. Eventually, the presently
   accepted structure of a regular-hexagonal, planar ring of carbons was
   adopted, and the exceptional thermodynamic and chemical stability of
   this system was attributed to resonance stabilization of a conjugated
   cyclic triene.

   <p>Here, two structurally and energetically equivalent electronic
   structures for a stable compound are written, but no single structure
   provides an accurate or even an adequate representation of the true
   molecule. The six-membered ring in benzene is a perfect hexagon (all
   carbon-carbon bonds have an identical length of 1.40 Å). The
   cyclohexatriene contributors would be expected to show alternating
   bond lengths, the double bonds being shorter (1.34 Å) than the single
   bonds (1.54 Å). An alternative representation for benzene (circle
   within a hexagon) emphasizes the pi-electron delocalization in this
   molecule, and has the advantage of being a single diagram. In cases
   such as these, the electron delocalization described by resonance
   enhances the stability of the molecules, and compounds composed of
   such molecules often show exceptional stability and related
   properties.

   <p>Evidence for the enhanced thermodynamic stability of benzene was
   obtained from measurements of the heat released when double bonds in a
   six-carbon ring are hydrogenated (hydrogen is added catalytically) to
   give cyclohexane as a common product. In the following diagram
   cyclohexane represents a low-energy reference point. Addition of
   hydrogen to cyclohexene produces cyclohexane and releases heat
   amounting to 28.6 kcal per mole. If we take this value to represent
   the energy cost of introducing one double bond into a six-carbon ring,
   we would expect a cyclohexadiene to release 57.2 kcal per mole on
   complete hydrogenation, and 1,3,5-cyclohexatriene to release 85.8 kcal
   per mole. These heats of hydrogenation would reflect the relative
   thermodynamic stability of the compounds. In practice,
   1,3-cyclohexadiene is slightly more stable than expected, by about 2
   kcal, presumably due to conjugation of the double bonds. Benzene,
   however, is an extraordinary 36 kcal/mole more stable than expected.
   This sort of stability enhancement is now accepted as a characteristic
   of all aromatic compounds.

      <p>   A molecular orbital description of benzene provides a more satisfying
   and more general treatment of "aromaticity". We know that benzene has
   a planar hexagonal structure in which all the carbon atoms are sp^2
   hybridized, and all the carbon-carbon bonds are equal in length. As
   shown below, the remaining cyclic array of six p-orbitals ( one on
   each carbon) overlap to generate six molecular orbitals, three bonding
   and three antibonding. The plus and minus signs shown in the diagram
   do not represent electrostatic charge, but refer to phase signs in the
   equations that describe these orbitals (in the diagram the phases are
   also color coded). When the phases correspond, the orbitals overlap to
   generate a common region of like phase, with those orbitals having the
   greatest overlap (e.g. p[1]) being lowest in energy. The remaining
   carbon valence electrons then occupy these molecular orbitals in
   pairs, resulting in a fully occupied (6 electrons) set of bonding
   molecular orbitals. It is this completely filled set of bonding
   orbitals, or closed shell, that gives the benzene ring its
   thermodynamic and chemical stability, just as a filled valence shell
   octet confers stability on the inert gases.

         
                     

  <h>Fused Benzene Ring Compounds

   <p>Benzene rings may be joined together (fused) to give larger polycyclic
   aromatic compounds. A few examples are drawn below, together with the
   approved numbering scheme for substituted derivatives. The peripheral
   carbon atoms (numbered in all but the last three examples) are all
   bonded to hydrogen atoms. The six benzene rings in coronene are fused
   in a planar ring; whereas the six rings in hexahelicene are not joined
   in a larger ring, but assume a helical turn, due to the crowding
   together of the terminal ring atoms. This helical configuration
   renders the hexihelicene molecule chiral, and it has been resolved
   into stable enantiomers having specific rotations of 3700º. Chime
   models of corannulene, coronene and hexahelicene may be examined by
   clicking on the appropriate structure in the diagram.

      
   <p>As these extended aromatic compounds become larger, the ratio of
   hydrogen to carbon decreases. For example, the symmetrical hexacyclic
   compound coronene has a H/C ratio =1/2, compared with 1 for benzene.
   If we were to imagine fused ring systems of this kind to be further
   extended in space, the H/C ratio would approach zero, and the
   resulting compound would be a form of carbon. Such a carbon allotrope
   exists and is called graphite. Another well-characterised carbon
   allotrope is diamond. The structures for these two forms of carbon are
   very different, and are displayed below. Diamond is an extended array
   of sp^3 hybridized carbon atoms; whereas, graphite consists of
   overlapping sheets of sp^2 hybridized carbon atoms arranged in a
   hexagonal pattern. You may examine Chime models of partial diamond and
   graphite structures by clicking on the appropriate structure below.


   <p>A comparison of the coronene and corannulene models discloses an
   interesting difference in their shapes. Coronene is absolutely flat
   and, aside from the peripheral hydrogens, resembles a layer of
   graphite. Its very high melting point reflects this resemblance.
   Corannulene, on the other hand, is slightly curved, resulting in a
   bowl-like shape.


   <p>If we extend the structure of corannulene by adding similar cycles of
   five benzene rings, the curvature of the resulting molecule should
   increase, and eventually close into a sphere of carbon atoms. The
   archtypical compound of this kind (C[60]) has been named
   buckminsterfullerene because of its resemblance to the geodesic
   structures created by Buckminster Fuller. It is a member of a family
   of similar carbon structures that are called fullerenes. These
   materials represent a third class of carbon allotropes. Alternating
   views of the C[60] fullerene structure are shown on the right,
   together with a soccer ball-like representation of the 12 five and 20
   six-membered rings composing its surface. By clicking on this graphic,
   a Chime model of C[60] will be displayed.
   <p>Although C[60] is composed of fused benzene rings its chemical
   reactivity resembles that of the cycloalkenes more than benzene.
   Indeed, exposure to light and oxygen slowly degrade fullerenes to cage
   opened products. Most of the reactions thus far reported for C[60]
   involve addition to, rather than substitution of, the core structure.
   These reactions include hydrogenation, bromination and hydroxylation.
   Strain introduced by the curvature of the surface may be responsible
   for the enhanced reactivity of C[60].
   . Larger fullerenes, such as C[70], C[76], C[82] & C[84]have
   elipsoidal or distorted spherical structures, and fullerene-like
   assemblies up to C[240] have been detected. A fascinating aspect of
   these structures is that the space within the carbon cage may hold
   atoms, ions or small molecules. Such species are called endohedral
   fullerenes. The cavity of C[60] is relatively small, but encapsulated
   helium, lithium and atomic nitrogen compounds have been observed.
   Larger fullerenes are found to encapsulate lanthanide metal atoms.

   <p>Interest in the fullerenes has led to the discovery of a related group
   of carbon structures referred to as nanotubes. As shown in the
   following illustration, nanotubes may be viewed as rolled up segments
   of graphite. The chief structural components are six-membered rings,
   but changes in tube diameter, branching into side tubes and the
   capping of tube ends is accomplished by fusion with five and
   seven-membered rings. Many interesting applications of these unusual
   structures have been proposed.

     
  <h>Other Aromatic Systems

   <p>Many unsaturated cyclic compounds have exceptional properties that we
   now consider characteristic of "aromatic" systems. The following cases
   are illustrative:


   <p>The first three compounds (cyclic polyenes) have properties associated
   with alkenes in general. Each reacts readily with bromine to give
   addition products, as do most alkenes. The thermodynamic change on
   introducing double bonds into the carbon atom ring is also typical of
   alkenes (a destabilization of ca. 26 kcal/mol for each double bond).
   Conjugation offsets this increase in energy by a small amount (4-6
   kcal/mol).

   <p>The remaining four compounds exhibit very different properties, and
   are considered aromatic. Benzene and pyridine are relatively
   unreactive with bromine, requiring heat and/or catalysts to force
   reaction, the result of which is substitution rather than addition.
   Furan and pyrrole react more rapidly with bromine, but they also give
   substitution products. This tendency to favor substitution rather than
   addition suggests that the parent unsaturated ring system has
   exceptional stability. Thermodynamic measurements support this
   conclusion. The enhanced stability, often referred to as aromatic
   stabilization, ranges (in the above cases) from a low of 16 kcal/mol
   for furan to 36 kcal/mol for benzene.

                      <h>Factors Required for Aromaticity

     <l> A planar (or near planar) cycle of sp^2 hybridized atoms, the
       p-orbitals of which are oriented parallel to each other. These
       overlapping p-orbitals generate an array of p-molecular orbitals.
     <l> These p-orbitals are occupied by 4n+2 electrons (where n is an
       integer or zero). This requirement is known as The Hückel Rule.
       All the aromatic compounds discussed above have 6 p-electrons
       (n=1).

   <p>1,3-Cyclopentadiene and 1,3,5-cycloheptatriene both fail to meet the
   first requirement, since one carbon atom of each ring is sp^3
   hybridized and has no p-orbital. Cyclooctatetraene fails both
   requirements, although it has a ring of sp^2 hybridized atoms. This
   molecule is not planar ( a geometry that would have 135º bond angles
   ). Angle strain is relieved by adopting a tub-shaped conformation;
   consequently, the p-orbitals can only overlap as isolated pairs, not
   over the entire ring. Furthermore, cyclooctatetraene has 8
   p-electrons, a number not consistent with the Hückel Rule.

   <p>Benzene is the archetypical aromatic compound. It is planar, bond
   angles=120º, all carbon atoms in the ring are sp^2 hybridized, and the
   pi-orbitals are occupied by 6 electrons. Pyridine is similar to
   benzene, but it is essential to recognize that the non-bonding
   electron pair on nitrogen occupies a sp^2 orbital lying in the plane
   of the ring, and is not part of the p-electron system. Thus pyridine
   has 6 p-electrons and 2 non-bonding sp^2 electrons.

   <p>Furan and pyrrole have five-membered rings, in which one atom is not
   carbon (a heteroatom) and has at least one pair of non-bonding valence
   shell electrons. By hybridizing this heteroatom to a sp^2 state, a
   p-orbital occupied by a pair of electrons and oriented parallel to the
   carbon p-orbitals is created. The resulting planar ring meets the
   first requirement for aromaticity, and the p-system is occupied by 6
   electrons, 4 from the two double bonds and 2 from the heteroatom, thus
   satisfying the Hückel Rule.

    <p>Four other examples of aromatic compounds are shown above. The sp^2
   hybridized ring atoms are connected by brown bonds, the p-electron
   pairs and bonds that constitute the aromatic ring are colored blue.
   Bonds and electron pairs that are not part of the aromatic annulene
   are black. The first example is imidazole, a heterocycle having two
   nitrogen atoms. Note that only one of the nitrogen non-bonding
   electron pairs is used for the aromatic p-electron sextet. The other
   electron pair (colored black) behaves similarly to the electron pair
   in pyridine. The second and third compounds have ten-membered rings,
   which are forced to be planar, or nearly planar, by the bridging bond
   or methylene group. These are 10 p-electron systems that fit the
   aromaticity requirements. Finally, the last example has a
   fourteen-membered ring with 7 double bonds. The bridging atoms and
   bonds force it to be planar. The number of p-electrons in this
   aromatic system is 14.

   <p>Monocyclic compounds made up of alternating conjugated double bonds
   are called annulenes. Benzene and 1,3,5,7-cyclooctatetraene are
   examples of annulenes; they are named [6]annulene and [8]annulene
   respectively, according to a general nomenclature system in which the
   number of pi-electrons in an annulene is designated by a number in
   brackets. Some annulenes are aromatic (e.g. benzene), but many are not
   due to non-planarity or a failure to satisfy the Hückel Rule.
   Non-planarity of a simple ring may be corrected by bridging bonds or
   atoms, as noted above.

                               <h>Aromatic Ions

   <p>Carbanions and carbocations may also show aromatic stabilization. Some
   examples are:

   <p>The three-membered ring cation has 2 p-electrons and is surprisingly
   stable, considering its ring strain. Cyclopentadiene is as acidic as
   ethanol, reflecting the stability of its 6 p-electron conjugate base.
   Salts of cycloheptatrienyl cation (tropylium ion) are stable in water
   solution, again reflecting the stability of this 6 p-electron cation.

  <h>Antiaromaticity

   <p>Conjugated ring systems having 4n p-electrons (e.g. 4, 8, 12 etc.
   electrons) not only fail to show any aromatic properties, but appear
   to be less stable and more reactive than expected. As noted above,
   1,3,5,7-cyclooctatetraene is non-planar and adopts a tub-shaped
   conformation. The compound is readily prepared, and undergoes addition
   reactions typical of alkenes. Catalytic hydrogenation of this tetraene
   produces cyclooctane. Planar bridged annulenes having 4n p-electrons
   have proven to be relatively unstable. Examples of 8 and 12-p-electron
   systems are shown below, together with a similar 10 p-electron
   aromatic compound.

                   
   <p>The simple C[8]H[6] hydrocarbon pentalene does not exist as a stable
   compound, and its hexaphenyl derivative is air sensitive. The
   12-p-electron analog heptalene has been prepared, but is also
   extremely reactive (more so than cyclooctatetraene). On the other
   hand, azulene is a stable 10-p-electron hydrocarbon that incorporates
   structural features of both pentalene and heptalene. Azuleneis a
   stable blue crystalline solid that undergoes a number of typical
   aromatic substitution reactions. The unexpected instability of 4n
   p-electron annulenes has been termed "antiaromaticity".
   Other examples may be cited. Thus, all attempts to isolate
   1,3-cyclobutadiene have yielded its dimer, or products from reactions
   with other compounds introduced into the reaction system. Similarly,
   cyclopentadienyl cation (4 p-electrons) and cycloheptatrienyl anion (8
   p-electrons) show very high reactivity when forced to form.

      

<h>Nucleophilicity & Basicity

         <h>Nucleophilicity and Basicity Factors in Organic Reactions

  <h>General Principals

   <p>Recall the definitions of electrophile and nucleophile:

   <l>Electrophile:   An electron deficient atom, ion or molecule that has
   an affinity for an electron pair, and will bond to a base or
   nucleophile.
   <l>Nucleophile:   An atom, ion or molecule that has an electron pair that
   may be donated in bonding to an electrophile (or Lewis acid).

   <p>Definitions and examples of acids and bases were provided earlier in
   this text, and should be reviewed if the reader is not comfortable
   with this subject.

   <p>Many functional groups have weakly electrophilic carbon atoms (colored
   red in the following examples). These include alkyl halides and
   sulfonate esters {C-X and C-OSO[2]R}, as well as carbonyl compounds
   such as aldehydes and ketones {C=O}. These electrophilic functions may
   react with nucleophiles (bases) in two distinct ways:

     <l>   Substitution or addition at carbon (this reflects
   nucleophilicity)
     <l>   b-Elimination or enolate anion formation (this reflects
   basicity)

   <p>Because these electrophilic reactants are weak, such reactions
   normally require strong nucleophiles or bases to proceed. However, if
   a preliminary ionization to a strongly electrophilic carbocation
   occurs:   [ C-X ----> C^(+) + X^(-) ]
   or if the carbonyl group is converted to its more electrophilic
   conjugate acid:   [ C=O + A^(+) ----> ^(+)C-O-A]
   then reactions with much weaker nucleophiles or bases may take
   place.^

   <p>Some confusion in distinguishing basicity (base strength) and
   nucleophilicity (nucleophile strength) is inevitable. Since basicity
   is a less troublesome concept; it is convenient to start with it.
   Basicity refers to the ability of a base to accept a proton. Basicity
   may be related to the pK[a] of the corresponding conjugate acid, as
   shown below. The strongest bases have the weakest conjugate acids and
   vice versa. The range of basicities included in the following table is
   remarkable, covering over fifty powers of ten!
   <p>In an acid-base equilibrium the weakest acid and the weakest base will
   predominate (they will necessarily be on the same side of the
   equilibrium). Learning the pK[a] values for common compounds provides
   a useful foundation on which to build an understanding of acid-base
   factors in reaction mechanisms.

      
   <p>Nucleophilicity is a more complex property. It commonly refers to the
   rate of substitution reactions at the halogen-bearing carbon atom of a
   reference alkyl halide, such as CH[3]-Br. Thus the nucleophilicity of
   the Nu:^(-) reactant in the following substitution reaction varies as
   shown in the chart below:

                              
   <p>The reactivity range encompassed by these reagents is over 5,000 fold,
   thiolate being the most reactive. Clearly, there are significant
   differences between these nucleophilicities and the basicities
   discussed above.

                  <p>Some useful trends have been documented:
           <l> For a given element, negatively charged species are more
       nucleophilic (and basic) than are equivalent neutral species.
          <l> For a given period of the periodic table, nucleophilicity
           (and basicity) decreases on moving from left to right.
          <l> For a given group of the periodic table, nucleophilicity
         increases from top to bottom (i.e. with increasing size),
                although there is a solvent dependence due to hydrogen
              bonding. Basicity varies in the opposite manner.

   <p>For two or more molecules incorporating nucleophilic atoms of the same
   kind and charge, the stronger base is usually the stronger
   nucleophile. Thus, 2,2,2-trifluroethoxide (pK[a] 12) is a weaker base
   and nucleophile than ethoxide (pK[a] 16). A notable exception to this
   rule occurs when a vicinal (adjacent) atom carries a non-bonding
   electron pair. Two common examples of this exception, called the alpha
   effect, are hydroxide ion (pK[a] 15.7) compared with hydroperoxide ion
   (pK[a] 11.6), and ammonia (pK[a] 9.3) compared with hydrazine (pK[a]
   8.0). In each of these pairs the weaker base is the stronger
   nucleophile.

  <h>Solvent Effects

   <p>Solvation of nucleophilic anions markedly influences
   their reactivity. The nucleophilicities cited above were obtained from
   reactions in methanol solution. Polar, protic solvents such as water
   and alcohols solvate anions by hydrogen bonding interactions, as shown
   in the diagram on the right. These solvated species are more stable
   and less reactive than the unsolvated "naked" anions. Polar, aprotic
   solvents such as DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), DMF (dimethylformamide)
   and acetonitrile do not solvate anions nearly as well as methanol, but
   provide good solvation of the accompanying cations. Consequently, most
   of the nucleophiles discussed here react more rapidly in solutions
   prepared from these solvents. These solvent effects are more
   pronounced for small basic anions than for large weakly basic anions.
   Thus, for reaction in DMSO solution we observe the following
   reactivity order:


   <p>Note that this order is roughly the order of increasing basicity (see
   above).


                            <h>Acid-Base Catalysis

   <p>As we have noted, many common organic reactions proceed by bonding
   between nucleophilic and electrophilic sites in the reactant
   molecules. Three examples are shown in equations 1 through 3;
   electrophiles are colored red, and nucleophiles are colored blue.


   <p>Reaction #1 is an example of a S[N]2 substitution reaction. The
   electrophilic carbon of 1-chlorobutane is attacked by the nucleophilic
   bromide anion in a single-step displacement process. The curly
   brackets enclose a structure for the transition state in this
   reaction.

   <p>Reactions #2 and #3 are two-step sequences. In the former addition
   reaction, bromine (an electrophile) attacks the nucleophilic double
   bond of 1-butene to give an electrophilic cyclic-bromonium
   intermediate (enclosed in square brackets) accompanied by a
   nucleophilic bromide ion. This ion-pair is very short-lived, another
   nucleophile-electrophile bonding reaction leads to the product
   (1,2-dibromobutane). In reaction #3 (a substitution reaction) the
   electrophilic carbonyl carbon atom bonds to the nucleophilic oxygen
   atom of ethyl alcohol to give an intermediate (in square brackets)
   that eliminates HCl, yielding the ester ethyl acetate. In all of these
   examples the reactivity of the electrophiles and nucleophiles is
   sufficient to allow reaction to proceed spontaneously at room
   temperature.

   <p>It is not difficult, however, to find very similar combinations of
   compounds that either fail to react at all, or do so extremely slowly.
   Equations 4 through 6 illustrate this behavior for analogs of the
   first three reactions.

                              
   <p>The factors that influence such differences in reactivity may be
   complex, but in the above cases are largely due to a poor anionic
   leaving group (eq. 4); aromatic stabilization and reduced
   nucleophilicity of a conjugated p-electron system (eq. 5); and reduced
   electrophilic character of a substituted carbonyl group (eq. 6).

   <p>First, compare reaction #4 with #1. Since oxygen is slightly more
   electronegative than chlorine (3.5 vs. 2.8 on the Pauling scale), we
   might expect a C-O bond to be more polar than a C-Cl bond. A better
   measure of the electrophilic character of a carbon atom in a compound
   comes from nmr chemical shifts (both ^1H & ^13C), and these indicate
   that oxygen and chlorine substituents exert similar effects when
   bonded to sp^3 hybridized carbon atoms. In any event, the failure of
   reaction #4 cannot be due to differences in the electrophilicity and
   nucleophilicity of the reactants.
   <p>The key factor here is the stability of the leaving anion (chloride
   vs. hydroxide). We know that HCl is a much stronger acid than water
   (by more than 15 powers of ten), and this difference will be reflected
   in reactions that generate their conjugate bases. Thus, chloride anion
   is much more stable and less reactive than is hydroxide anion, so the
   former is a better and more common leaving group. Indeed, the failure
   of alcohols to undergo S[N]2 substitution reactions makes them useful
   solvents for many such reactions, including #1.

   <p>In the case of reaction #5, the aromatic stabilization of the benzene
   ring makes it less susceptible to attack by electrophiles than are
   simple alkenes. Thus, elemental bromine is not sufficiently
   electrophilic to induce a reaction with benzene, even though the
   latter is nucleophilic.

   <p>Lastly, reactions #3 and #6 illustrate differences in the reactivity
   of carbonyl compounds. We know that the carbon atom of a carbonyl
   group is electrophilic and undergoes reaction with a variety of
   nucleophiles. However, this electrophilic character may be enhanced or
   diminished by substituents. If we take saturated aldehydes (RCH=O) as
   a reference, the additional alkyl substituent present in ketones
   slightly reduces this electrophilicity, but the general reactivity
   pattern of these classes is similar. On the other hand, a chlorine
   substituent is inductively electron withdrawing and increases the
   electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon significantly. Thus, acid
   chlorides are very reactive with a wide range of nucleophiles,
   including water and alcohols (eq. 3).
   <p>The oxygen and nitrogen substituents present in esters and amides have
   a similar inductive effect, but also a pronounced electron donating
   character through a resonance interaction. Consequently, the carbonyl
   carbon atom becomes less electrophilic, and these functional groups
   are less reactive than other carbonyl compounds. Thus, the failure of
   ethyl acetate to react with water (eq. 6) reflects the reduced
   electrophilic character of its carbonyl group.

   <p>Fortunately, these retarding factors can often be overcome by acid or
   base catalysis, which in general enhances electrophilicity (acids) or
   nucleophilicity (bases). Equations 7 through 9 show how this tactic
   may be effectively applied to the unreactive examples given above.

                            
   <p>In strong acid, reaction #4 proceeds nicely, as shown in equation 7.
   This is because the leaving group has changed from hydroxide anion to
   water (the acidity of the conjugate acid H[3]O^(+) is nearly that of
   HCl).
   <p> In the second example, there are two obvious ways of circumventing
   the failure of benzene to react with bromine:
             <l> The bromine can be made more electrophilic
             <l> The benzene ring can be made more nucleophilic.
   <p>The first tactic can be implemented by mixing bromine with ferric
   bromide, a Lewis acid catalyst. This generates the bromonium cation,
   Br^(+), a powerful electrophile. Equation #8 illustrates this
   approach.
   <p>The second tactic requires that the benzene ring be activated (made
   more nucleophilic) by substitution with an electron donating group
   such as OH or NH[2]. For example, we find that phenol (hydroxybenzene)
   reacts rapidly with bromine in the absence of any catalyst.

   <p>Finally, we can see that there are two ways of facilitating the ester
   hydrolysis reaction.:
             <l> We can use a stronger nucleophile than water, such as
   hydroxide anion.
             <l> We can increase the electrophile reactivity by converting
   the ester to its conjugate acid, CH[3]C(OH)OC[2]H[5] ^(+).
   <p> Equation #9 shows the former approach, which is an example of base
   catalysis. Acid catalysis of the reaction also works well.
