   <p>Growing Christmas Trees in North Carolina 

<h>Christmas Tree Fertility

   <p>Optimum fertilization promotes quality growth and gives trees
   luxuriant foliage with a deep, rich color. Trees with balanced
   nutrients are more resistant to pest problems and environmental
   stresses. The amount of fertilizer or lime needed to achieve optimum
   nutrient levels in the tree will vary with different soils and sites
   or even different land use history. Too much of a nutrient is often as
   harmful to Christmas trees as too little. The only way to optimize
   tree growth is to follow through with site-specific fertilizer
   applications based on the results of timely soil and tissue analysis.
   Effective fertilizer management is an ongoing process that succeeds
   best when carefully planned and maintained throughout the crop
   rotation.

   <p>Soil samples should be taken regularly throughout the course of
   growing Christmas trees. The first soil samples should be taken during
   initial site evaluation. If the pH or nutrients such as phosphorus or
   calcium are low, materials can be tilled into the soil before tree
   planting with greater success than later top dressing of fertilizers
   or lime. Subsequent soil samples should be collected at least every
   other year, and many growers choose to take annual samples. Time
   invested in careful collection of soil samples will increase
   effectiveness of any following fertilizer applications. In North
   Carolina, soil sample boxes can be obtained and samples sent from any
   North Carolina Cooperative Extension Service County Center. The North
   Carolina Department of Agriculture provides soil and plant tissue
   analysis as well as other diagnostic services to in-state residents.

   <p>Once the trees in a field are well established, plant tissue samples
   should periodically be collected along with regular soil samples.
   Tissue analysis provides the status of 11 nutrients inside the plant
   (four more than reported in soil analysis). Tissue sampling also
   reflects what a plant is actually able to obtain from the soil, not
   just what is available. Under normal growing conditions, tissue
   samples should accompany the soil samples at about the middle of the
   rotation and then again the year before harvest. Usually about two
   shoots are collected from the same five to 10 trees from which soil is
   sampled. Tissue sampling is a necessary tool for evaluating and
   fine-tuning fertility management.

   <p>When fertility problems occur in a field, additional sampling can be
   useful. Problem areas should be sampled (and managed) separately from
   normal areas of a field. The contrast between normal and problem
   samples can often pinpoint the cause of a fertility problem. Often
   multiple-depth soil sampling can provide greater insight than a single
   topsoil sample. When nutritional problems occur, matching tissue
   samples should accompany any special soil sampling. It may take
   several seasons to correct a fertility problem.

   <p>Fertilizer materials should be targeted to the recommendations and
   deficiencies identified by soil and tissue analysis for each field,
   without applying a single blended material across the board. Annual
   applications of nitrogen per acre are recommended based on the
   requirements of the crop and the age and size of the trees. Different
   amounts of a nitrogen fertilizer will be needed depending on the
   percentage of actual nitrogen contained in it. Different nitrogen
   sources have varying effect on pH, soluble salt index, and leaching
   and should be selected accordingly. Different blends can also satisfy
   the need for certain amounts of phosphorous, potassium, or other
   nutrients and should be selected to fulfill the ratio of requirements
   for each nutrient. See Table 4 for a list of commonly used fertilizers
   and their characteristics.

   <p>Both the timing and method of fertilizer application are critical to
   successful nutrient management. Different nutrients have their own
   requirements for timing. Materials with a high soluble salt content
   containing nitrogen or potassium should not be applied during the heat
   of summer or during a drought. Large applications should be split
   between two timings. Phosphorus should be built up early in a crop
   rotation rather than adding an incremental amount each season. Early
   in a rotation, many growers band fertilizer outside the dripline of
   small trees to maximize availability, but after trees are about 2
   years old, broadcast applications are most effective. Where growers
   mechanize their fertilization, they are often able to achieve a more
   uniform broadcast application. While ground-applied fertilization is
   the primary method of nutrient delivery, it occasionally must be
   supplemented with foliar-applied liquid sprays particularly where
   micronutrients are deficient or tied up in the soil.

   <p>For a fertility program to succeed, a variety of tools and methods
   must be used, usually in different combinations from season to season.

<h>Best Management Practices to Protect Water Quality and the Environment

   <p>Although of primary importance, tree quality and net farm profit are
   not the only objectives that a Christmas tree grower should pursue. A
   farmer should manage the crop in such a way that production can be
   sustained well into the future. To achieve this, the quality of life
   must be protected on all levels. Soil must be protected from erosion.
   Surface and groundwater must be protected from sedimentation and
   contamination by fertilizers or pesticides. Wildlife should not be
   harmed by any farming practices. The health of farm workers should not
   be endangered by improper handling, storage, or use of pesticides.

   <p>Christmas tree farmers who invest in practices and inputs that
   accomplish these goals usually show a greater long-term profit because
   the land is maintained at highly productive levels. Collectively, the
   added or alternative production practices that protect the quality of
   life are called best management practices. For production to be
   sustained, a combination of the following best management practices
   should be in place on every Christmas tree farm.

  <h>Farm Road Construction

   <p>The roads on many farms are too steep, are constructed of easily
   erodible material, and/or are poorly designed to manage flood water.
   Roads constructed at no more than a 9 percent grade will not generally
   wash out. Adequate drainage ditches with large gravel or riprap will
   eliminate erosion of the roadbed and water drainage problems in fields
   below the road. Installing an adequate surface to handle traffic is
   also critical. With increasing grade, slope length, and traffic,
   fescue grass will fail before a gravel surface will. Professional
   advice from soil conservationists should be utilized to develop plans
   for long-lasting roads (and fields) or to solve problems with existing
   roads.


  <h>Field Borders and Stream Buffers

   <p>Field borders and stream buffers are perhaps the cheapest way to
   contain sediments and any nutrients or pesticides that are present in
   the sediments. A 10- to 25-foot-wide grassy strip will trap
   sedimentation from all but the most severe rain storms. These strips
   can usually double as field roads.

  <h>Low-Impact Site Preparation

   <p>Some land currently in Christmas tree production is too steep and
   erodible to bear extensive mechanical site preparation. Soils also may
   be too shallow or easily compacted to withstand the heavy traffic.
   Less disruptive site preparation practices have been developed for
   these situations. Any timber and brush is cut close to the ground
   without disturbing the mat of roots that hold the soil in place. All
   or a majority of stumps are left undisturbed. No tillage is attempted.
   If seedlings are planted mechanically, any areas near stumps are
   planted by hand or left empty. Hardwood sprouts from stumps are a
   greater problem with this approach, but labeled herbicides can control
   them. Achieving optimum fertility may also be more difficult without
   tillage, but by preserving the topsoil, Christmas tree production can
   be sustained on these difficult sites.

  <h>Pest Scouting 

   <p>By scouting for pests, growers can reduce the frequency of pesticide
   applications and the cost of pest management program while increasing
   the effectiveness of their efforts. Pest thresholds and scouting
   methods have been developed for most of the major Christmas tree
   pests. Information generated by scouting indicates the need for
   pesticide applications and assures that such applications are targeted
   to potentially damaging pest populations.

  <h>Pesticide Alternatives 

   <p>Where several pesticides are labeled for a specific Christmas tree
   pest, growers have the choice of selecting the material that is least
   toxic to beneficial insects, the environment, and wildlife. Toxicity
   of certain pesticides to specific groups of animals, such as fish or
   aquatic insects, can vary significantly. Safe pesticide choices will
   change depending on proximity to critical habitats or even the season
   and life cycle of vulnerable wildlife species. Some less-toxic
   materials may require different equipment, handling, or timing from
   traditional pesticide choices. Be sure to evaluate all factors when
   considering pesticide selection. For some pests, growers can apply
   pesticides at alternative times, such as fall or winter, when
   beneficial insects or at-risk wildlife are not present.

                                                             

  <h>Groundcover Management 

   <p>Production of quality Christmas trees depends largely on the balanced
   management of weed competition. Unchecked weed competition hurts tree
   growth, but repeated exposure of the soil surface with resulting
   erosion will shorten the productive life of a field. Out of necessity,
   growers have moved away from predominant use of long-lasting
   pre-emergent herbicides and bare-ground weed control. Groundcovers are
   the primary tool for stabilizing the soil within a field of trees.
   Best management practices involve suppression of native vegetation
   and/or establishment of cover crops. This reduces competition for
   nutrients, water, and space while maintaining almost total coverage of
   the soil. An alternative practice is to sow cover crops, such as
   clover or rye, that reduce germination of native weed seeds and that
   can be managed more uniformly. Regardless of the approach,
   groundcovers are a second crop that must be consciously managed in any
   Christmas tree field.

  <h>Nutrient Management

   <p>In North Carolina regions having sandy soils and shallow water tables,
   nutrient management is a critical factor in the availability of clean
   and healthy drinking water. Large applications of fertilizer can
   possibly leach into the groundwater. Smaller applications spread out
   over a season can increase uptake by the crop and reduce the
   probability of leaching. Leaching of fertilizer into the groundwater
   is not generally a major problem, but some precautions are still
   necessary. Best management practices depend on regular use of soil and
   tissue analysis as the basis for all fertilizer and lime applications.
   Applications should be specific to the needs of each field. Where
   practical, annual nitrogen requirements should be split into two
   applications to reduce leaching potential and risk of salt injury to
   tree roots.

  <h>Pesticide Handling, Storage, and Disposal 

   <p>Pesticides are most hazardous when they are in concentrated form
   during mixing, storage, and disposal. Pesticides should always be
   mixed and loaded far away from wells, springs, or streams. Progressive
   farmers are installing covered and contained concrete mixing pads,
   which capture any spills or rinse water. Secure pesticide storage
   areas are built on the same pads. PVC field mixing pads eliminate
   risky pouring from pesticide containers and cost less than permanent
   facilities. When empty, all liquid pesticide containers should be
   triple-rinsed and punctured before disposal in landfills. Other
   methods of disposing of containers are illegal and risk groundwater
   contamination. For liability and safety considerations, farm managers
   and foremen should all be knowledgeable about the handling, storage,
   and legal disposal of pesticides and their containers. Pesticide
   handlers must complete the appropriate licensing and pesticide
   training.

  <h>Wellhead Protection 

   <p>Poorly-constructed wellheads are a major source of groundwater
   contamination from fertilizers or pesticides. Good wells are grouted
   and sealed with concrete and, ideally, enclosed in a concrete cover
   with a concrete floor. Several management practices can reduce the
   risk of groundwater contamination regardless of well construction. No
   agricultural materials should be mixed at the wellhead. Hoses or
   faucets should provide water at a mixing area away from and preferably
   downhill from the wellhead. A grassy buffer at least 10 feet wide
   should protect the well from high traffic areas or any pesticide
   application areas. The well cover should be above the surrounding
   landscape and the immediate land should slope away from the well. If
   production areas are above a well, consideration should be given to
   the leachability of fertilizers or pesticides used.

  <h>Summary 

   <p>Christmas trees are a renewable and sustainable agricultural crop.
   With appropriate consideration of water quality, environmental
   considerations, and worker safety, problems need not occur.

<h>Shaping of Christmas Trees

   <p>Shaping is necessary for high-quality Christmas trees. The term
   "shaping" is applied to any cutting done to shape the plant to its
   desired appearance. This may done by either shearing or pruning.

   <p>The term "shearing" refers to cutting back the current year's growth
   of the leader and lateral limbs. Shearing reduces deformities and
   improves the shape of the tree. Pruning is the removal of injured,
   dead, or diseased parts or wood older than the current growth.

   <p>Since any one set of guidelines is not suitable for all trees, several
   species will be considered separately. Ideally a tree should resemble
   a cone, wide at the base and tapering uniformly to the tip. The base
   should be about two-thirds as wide as the tree is tall. Taper is
   defined as the tree width at the base divided by the tree height.
   Acceptable standards for a taper will range from a minimum width of 40
   percent of the height to a maximum of 90 percent.

   <p>Some growers prefer to shear using knives with a 14-inch blade,
   although strong hedge shears and specially-designed machines can be
   used with success. If knives are used, they should have high-quality
   blades that retain a very sharp edge with minimum sharpening.
   Regardless of the type of tool used, personal safety is a primary
   concern.

  <h>Firs and Spruces 

   <p>Firs and spruces require substantially different treatments than
   pines. In these species, lateral buds develop along the current leader
   and branch growth and are not initiated from fascicles (bundles of
   needles found on pines). New growth may be cut any time after branch
   elongation is 80 percent complete until the following spring before
   new growth starts.

   <p>It is best to use a minimum amount of shearing and pruning so that the
   trees will have a natural appearance. The main thing to strive for is
   compactness by controlling height and lateral growth. Most growers cut
   the leaders in summer, although the same process may be used until
   late spring just before dormancy is broken. To maintain the desired
   cone shape, the terminal portion of lateral branches are also removed.
   Correct summer shearing allows for development of a denser,
   higher-quality tree, through growth of vegetative buds on the stem and
   branches.

   <p>When the trees reach 3 to 4 feet in height, bottom branches may be cut
   to provide a "handle," depending on what buyers expect.

  <h>White Pine

   <p>It is important to start shearing white pine at the proper year and
   season. When the tree is about 12 to 24 inches in height, the terminal
   bud should be removed to provide more limbs for what will be the base
   of the tree. This height should be adjusted upward for a tree growing
   on a steep slope. Shearing will stimulate production of buds and make
   the tree more dense and compact. The season to shear white pine is
   between the time the new leader completes its growth and before it
   "hardens." These dates vary with the growing conditions, the
   elevation, and the season, but is generally during the period of June
   to early-July.

   <p>Start shearing by cutting the leader to desired length (10 to 14
   inches is usually best) at a 45-degree angle, with the face of the cut
   in a northerly direction to reduce drying. The side branches of the
   top whorl should be cut so that they are 3 to 5 inches shorter than
   the terminal. The side branches are then clipped to shape the tree
   into a cone. Overshearing should be avoided, as close- shaved trees
   are not the most desirable.

   <p>Shearing should be restricted to the current year's growth because
   older growth does not usually set buds. When the tree is about 3 feet
   to 4 feet high, bottom branches should be cut off so that a handle
   will be available when the tree is harvested.

  <h>Virginia Pine

   <p>Guidelines for shaping Virginia pine are generally similar to those
   for white pine. However, because of its growth habit, Virginia pine
   needs to be sheared at least twice and sometimes more frequently each
   year.

   <p>Time of shearing can be better judged from needle growth than the
   calendar. A good rule is to begin shearing when new needles are
   one-half as long as needles from the previous flush.

   <p>Corrective shaping can usually be done at any time of the year. It is
   extremely important that multiple leaders be removed early in the life
   of the tree. Additionally "handles" should be pruned at least 2 years
   before harvest.

  <h>Redcedar and Leyland Cypress

   <p>Redcedar can be sheared lightly at any time during the growing season
   with hedge clippers or knives. Leyland cypress should also be sheared
   lightly, with the best time late in the growing season.

<h>Groundcover Management

   <p>Groundcover or vegetation management is essential in producing
   high-quality Christmas trees. Many growers have produced Christmas
   trees with bare ground because they were worried about groundcover
   competition for water, nutrients, and light. However, maintaining bare
   soil can lead to soil deterioration resulting in increased soil
   erosion, poor root growth, and poor tree quality. There are many
   groundcovers ranging from native plants to introduced plant species
   which, if managed properly, can be used as a groundcover without
   impacting tree growth and quality.

   <p>Scouting weed species in the plantation is the first step in a
   groundcover management program. Information on weed identification can
   be obtained from various agencies, and there are many good weed
   identification references (see Appendix). Identifying the type,
   density, and location of the vegetation in the plantation is an
   important part of the management process.

   <p>Vegetation may be grouped into five major categories: perennial
   grasses, perennial broadleafs, annual grasses, annual broadleafs, and
   woody perennial vegetation (trees, shrubs, and vines).

   <p>Whether the vegetation occurs between the rows or within rows is also
   important. Competition is greatest from vegetation in the area
   immediately around the tree or within a row. Vegetation growing
   between the rows is less of a competitive threat simply because it is
   further from the tree.

   <p>Since perennial grasses are very competitive, growers should minimize
   them within rows. In addition, perennial grasses found between rows
   should be mechanically or chemically mowed (suppressed via low rates
   of post-emergence herbicides) to control competition.

   <p>While woody vegetation is not particularly competitive, it does
   interfere with tree work, and is easiest to control prior to planting.
   Since most woody vegetation is perennial with well established deep
   root systems, it can be particularly difficult to control. Choice of
   control measures and timing is critical.

   <p>Vegetation desirable for use as groundcover generally exhibits one of
   two useful characteristics: it is naturally less competitive, or it is
   reliably controlled either through mechanical or chemical mowing. Less
   competitive groundcovers include broadleaf annuals or perennials that
   seldom grow tall enough to interfere with tree growth. Such species
   include strawberries, violets, dandelions, plantains, groundsels, and
   common trailing cinquefoil. Groundcovers that can and must be
   suppressed because they are otherwise too competitive or interfere
   with shearing or harvest include clover, smartweed, wild carrot,
   yarrow, red sorrel, nimblewill grass, chickweed, annual grasses, and
   some perennial grasses.

   <p>The two principal methods for maintaining groundcover at an acceptable
   height between the rows are mechanical mowing and chemical
   application, either separately or in combination.

  <h>Mechanical Mowing

   <p>Mowing is an effective way to keep competing plants under control
   between rows. Properly timed mowing reduces competition, rodent
   damage, and fire hazard. Rotary-type mowers are usually preferred for
   grass control, as sickle bars are particularly apt to damage or cut
   trees. However, mechanical mowing will favor grass species that are
   most competitive to trees.

   <p>Mowing alone must be repeated several times during the growing season.
   It should be done often enough to prevent the grasses from forming
   seeds that could germinate within the row. Weather greatly determines
   timing of the first and subsequent mowing operations. A cool, dry
   spring can delay the first mowing. Subsequent mowing during the
   growing season depends largely on the frequency and amount of rainfall
   and fertility of the site.

  <h>Chemical Application

   <p>Herbicides are an effective substitute to mechanical mowing for
   controlling competition by weeds and grasses. Herbicides are generally
   classified as either pre-emergent or post-emergent, depending on the
   stage of the weeds the herbicide is designed to control.

   <p>The effectiveness of a chemical can vary from no response to a
   complete kill, depending on application conditions and procedures. To
   be effective, herbicides should be carefully selected. Several
   different uses of chemicals are in new plantings in a cleanly
   cultivated field, new plantings in a sod, or on established
   plantations. Response to chemicals will depend on several factors,
   such as size, kind and growing condition of target plants, time of
   application, soil composition, rainfall, temperature, rate of
   deterioration before being incorporated into the soil, and persistence
   of the chemical. Most properly-formulated herbicides are short-lived
   in the environment, but still they must be carefully used to prevent
   long-lasting effects by changing the composition of the plant
   community.

   <p>"Chemical mowing" is a term used to describe the practice of applying
   post-emergent herbicides at low rates to stunt or suppress weeds and
   grasses. This practice was developed to provide growers with a
   cost-effective, soil conserving alternative to broadcast application
   of pre-emergence herbicides or mechanical mowing. Chemical mowing can
   be used as a broadcast application or as a between-row treatment where
   trees were previously banded in the row with pre-emergence herbicides.

   <p>Chemical mowing is generally more economical than traditional
   mechanical mowing. The application of low rates of herbicides two or
   three times during the growing season is usually less expensive than
   maintaining mowers and paying for the labor to mow several times a
   season. Chemical mowing typically provides control for 6 to 8 weeks,
   compared to 3 to 4 weeks for mechanical mowing.

   <p>Chemical mowing also fits well with many of the strategies used in
   Integrated Pest Management (IPM). It is especially important to the
   management of white grubs. By leaving a ragged height of suppressed
   vegetation, May and June beetles (the adults of white grubs) are less
   likely to lay their eggs than they are in mechanically mowed
   vegetation.

   <p>It should be noted that the need for pre-emergence herbicide
   applications cannot be totally eliminated by chemical mowing.
