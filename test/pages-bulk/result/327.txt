   <h>Road Test: Citroen C3 Pluriel (2003-)
   <p>Superminis
   Citroen C3 Pluriel (03- )
   <p>COMFORT AND EQUIPMENT RATING: 
   <p>Given its versatility, the Pluriel is fairly refined, although long
   trips will not be completely relaxing even with the roof closed;
   motorway roar is never fully silenced. The squashy front seats are
   pretty comfortable, a sensation heightened by the airy view out, but
   in the back, it's cramped. The ride quality is fairly soft, but it's
   not soft enough to stop the body quivering on rougher roads, or the
   structure rattling and creaking too. But in the context of the price
   and its versatility, the tremors through the Pluriel's body aren't too
   bad. It's still too early to say whether it will stay that way with
   age, though. Not surprisingly, with the roof folded and all four
   windows dropped - a very enjoyable configuration on a hot summer's day
   - there's a lot of wind roar, but it's tolerable, even on a longish
   drive. The high windscreen offers good protection against buffeting,
   and it's nice to have the choice of different degrees of exposure to
   the elements. You can just about get two adults in the rear seats,
   though front seat occupants may have to move their chairs forward to
   accommodate back-benchers' legs. You certainly wouldn't call it
   spacious, but it's tolerable for short trips. The two rear seats are
   less shaped and more bench-like than those in the Peugeot 206 CC, so
   there is some scope for overflow/sitting sideways. The driver and
   front seat passenger have plenty of room, though, and where the
   Pluriel really comes into its own is with its boot space. Better than
   many conventional superminis with the roof in place - or even with the
   rear screen and fabric stowed away (these fit under the floor) - the
   roof structure does not compromise luggage capacity. With the rear
   seats folded, a long, flat load bay can be created - roof up or down -
   and whilst it's not quite the pick-up truck Citroen claimed in its
   original blurb, the Pluriel can double up as something quite useful if
   you need to transport that flatpack or go to the rubbish tip. A
   single-slot CD player and radio with six speakers and steering
   wheel-mounted controls are fitted as standard, and it's a decent
   system (not that you can hear it that well with the roof down).
   Citroen dealers offer a five-CD autochanger for extra cost, but
   there's no satellite navigation on the options list.
