                            <h>Diastolic Heart Failure

   <p>The heart's pumping cycle has 2 phases:

   <p>Diastole
   <p>(pronounced : die ass tuh lee)
   <p>the heart muscle relaxes and fills with blood

   <p>Systole
   <p>(pronounced : sis tuh lee)
   <p>the heart muscle contracts (squeezes) and pumps blood out into the
   body


   <p>updated July 5, 2006 - People think of heart failure as a condition
   where the heart does not pump out enough blood. That is called
   systolic heart failure. However, many CHFers have a different kind of
   heart failure - caused when the heart does not fully relax, so it does
   not fill properly with blood. This is called diastolic heart failure.
   This page is about diastolic heart failure or DHF.
        <p>In mild DHF, SOB and fatigue usually only happen during stress or
   activity. More severe DHF causes many of the same symptoms that
   systolic heart failure or SHF, causes.
        <p>A person with DHF has high pressures in the arteries of their
   lungs - pulmonary pressure. Their heart's pumping chambers may not be
   enlarged and their ejection fraction may be normal, but they still
   have the same nasty symptoms as a person with SHF.
         In people with diastolic heart failure, Toprol-XL may be a
   better beta-blocker choice than Coreg. Too-low blood pressure can be a
   real problem for DHF patients. Toprol-XL does not lower blood pressure
   as much as Coreg.
 
<h>Causes of diastolic heart failure

     <l> Ischemia - can be caused by CAD or by a chronic too-fast heart
       rate. Ischemia prevents the heart muscle from fully relaxing and
       increases heart stiffness. Chronic ischemia results in remodeling
       and DHF
     <l> pressure overload caused by chronic high blood pressure or aortic
       valve problems
     <l> infiltrative cardiomyopathies, also called restrictive
       cardiomyopathy
     <l> pericarditis - inflammation of the sac around the outside of the
       heart
     <l> normal aging can cause some DHF
     <l> chemotherapy for diseases like cancer
     <l> genetic causes

  <h>Diagnosing diastolic heart failure

   <p>How to always diagnose DHF accurately is uncertain but a correct
   diagnosis is important. Some guidelines propose that 3 requirements be
   met to make the call:
    <l> symptoms or signs of CHF
    <l> normal systolic function
    <l> abnormal diastolic function

   <p>There are some situations where symptoms alone may lead to a
   misdiagnosis. This is especially true in older patients who get short
   of breath mainly because they have very poor physical fitness. It can
   also happen with non-heart-related shortness of breath such as with
   lung disease. So diagnosing DHF requires some signs or symptoms of CHF
   like lung congestion, edema, raised jugular vein, etc. You do have to
   rule out problems like mitral valve disease and and lung disease.
        <p>DHF cannot usually be distinguished from SHF by patient history,
   physical exam, x-ray, and EKG alone. Diagnosis requires an estimate of
   LV size and EF. These measurements can be made using echo, MUGA, or
   cath. Really, DHF diagnosis is a matter of ruling out other possible
   causes in patients seeming to have heart failure but who have normal
   heart size and EF.
        Since echo does have limits for spotting DHF and cath is
   invasive, one trial studied whether the BNP blood test could help spot
   diastolic heart failure. That study is shown on the BNP Test page. It
   turns out that a quick BNP test can help a doctor diagnose DHF.

   <h>Diagnosis: Systolic versus diastolic heart failure
      
   <h>Symptoms
    <l>Shortness of breath on exertion  85%  96%
    <l>Waking at night short of breath  55%  50%
    <l>Difficulty breathing except upright  60%  73%
   <h>Physical Examination
    <l>Jugular vein swollen  35%  46%
    <l>Sounds in lungs  72%  70%
    <l>Point of maximum impulse  50%  60%
     <l>Enlarged (congested) liver  15%  16%
    <l>Edema  30%  40%
    <l>Heart enlargement on chest x-ray  90%  96%
    <l>High pulmonary (lung) pressures  75%  80%

    <h>How common is DHF?

   <p>As many as 33% of patients with obvious heart failure and a normal EF
   may have DHF. Risk of DHF increases with age:
    <l> 15% in patients under 60 years
    <l> 35% in patients 60 to 70 years
    <l> 50% in patients over 70 years old

      <h>Mortality

   <p>Prognosis of patients with DHF is better than for SHF. Annual
   mortality for DHF is about 5 to 8%, while it is about 10 to 15% for
   SHF. In healthy people of the same age, mortality is about 1%. In DHF
   patients, prognosis is also affected by cause. When CAD is not the
   cause, annual mortality is much better, at about 2% to 3%. Age also
   affects risk of death. The 5-year mortality rate in DHF patients is:
    <l> 25% in patients under 60 years old
    <l> 35% in patients 60 to 70 years
    <l> 50% in patients over 70 years old

        <h>Complications

   <p>The complication rate is about the same as for SHF patients. DHF
   causes frequent outpatient visits and hospital admissions. The one
   year readmission rate is almost 50% in DHF patients.

   <h>Treatment

   <p>Treatment guidelines for systolic heart failure are based on large,
   properly done trials. Unfortunately, no such trials exist for DHF. So
   guidelines come from small trials, a doctor's experience, and his
   understanding of the disease. The general approach to treating DHF has
   3 main steps:
    <l> Treatment should reduce symptoms, mainly by lowering pulmonary
       pressure. Ways to reduce pressure include reducing heart size,
       maintaining good pumping in the heart's upper chambers, and
       slowing the heart rate.
    <l> Treatment should target the underlying cause if possible. For
       example, high blood pressure should be controlled, remodeling
       should be reversed, the aortic valve replaced if necessary, and
       ischemia treated by increasing blood flow to the heart and
       reducing its need for oxygen
    <l> Treatment should target the bodily systems changed by the disease,
       mainly neurohormonal systems

   <h>Drug Therapy - General Principles

   <p>With some exceptions, many of the drugs used to treat systolic heart
   pressure are also used to treat diastolic heart failure. However, the
   reason they are used and the dose may be different for DHF.
        <p>For example, in DHF beta-blockers are used to make filling the
   heart with blood take longer, and to change the heart's response to
   exercise. In SHF, beta-blockers are used to increase pumping power and
   reverse heart remodeling. Diuretic dose for DHF is usually much
   smaller than for SHF. Calcium channel blockers have no place in SHF
   treatment but may help DHF.
        <p>The first step in treating DHF patients is to reduce lung
   congestion. You do that by lowering pulmonary (lung) pressure. This
   has 3 steps:

   <h>Reduce heart size
          <p>At first, heart size can be reduced by restricting fluid and
          sodium intake, by dialysis or filtering the blood,
          plasmapheresis, and diuretics. Relaxing (dilating) the blood
          vessels using nitro or morphine is effective but should be
          started at low doses to avoid low blood pressure. Low blood
          pressure can be a real problem in DHF patients. Long-term
          treatment should include small to moderate diuretic doses, mild
          doses of long-acting nitro, and restricted sodium intake.
          Aldactone (spironolactone) may be effective long-term because
          it suppresses the RAS. ACE inhibitors and ARBs reduce fluid
          retention and oxygen demand.


   <h>Make the heart's chambers beat together as a team
          <p>The second step in lowering pulmonary pressure is to keep the
          heart's upper chambers (atriums) beating properly. Atrial
          fibrillation is poorly tolerated in DHF patients because it
          increases diastolic pressures, causing lung congestion and low
          blood pressure.In patients with a-fib, restoring normal rhythm
          should be a priority. Patients who need a pacemaker should have
          atrial pacing as well as ventricular pacing.


   <h>Slowing the heart rate
          <p>The third step in lowering pulmonary pressures is to slow the
          heart rate. This gives the heart more time to relax so it can
          fill with blood. Fast heart rate is poorly tolerated in DHF
          patients because rapid heart rate:

         <l> increases the heart's oxygen demand and reduces blood flow to
            the heart, causing ischemia even without CAD
         <l> prevents full relaxation of the heart muscle, which raises
            pressure and reduces the heart's flexibility
         <l> shortens the heart's relaxation period, making it incomplete,
            which reduces the amount of blood pumped per beat

   <p>For these reasons, most doctors use beta-blockers and calcium channel
   blockers to slow the heart rate a lot in DHF patients. However,
   slowing the heart rate too much can reduce cardiac output despite
   better filling. This is why DHF patients need very individualized
   treatment. An initial goal might be a resting heart rate of about 60
   beats per minute.
        <p>Beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers increase the time it
   takes the heart to fill with blood. This helps keep pulmonary
   pressures low. However, these drugs also directly reduce the heart's
   ability to relax by their effects at the cell level. It's a tricky
   balance to strike in DHF patients. The overall effect of these drugs
   in DHF patients is improved symptoms.
        <p>The long-term effect of calcium channel blockers on diastolic
   heart failure patients is unknown. All calcium channel blockers except
   amlodipine increase mortality in patients with systolic heart failure.

    <h>Nebivolol Helps CHF Seniors with Normal EF

   <p>March 27, 2006 - A "third generation" (new) beta-blocker called
   Nebivolol is on the way. Nebivolol has the main good benefit of
   Toprol-XL (beta-1 blocking without beta-2 blocking) plus one of the
   good benefits of Coreg (relaxing the arteries, called vasodilation).
   It also helps endothelial function and is a powerful anti-oxidant.
   Nebivolol does this without all of Coreg's side effects.
        <p>Researchers studied how nebivolol affects systolic versus
   diastolic left heart function in patients. This substudy included 104
   patients; 43 had an EF less than 36%. Echo was done on each patient to
   take quite a few heart measures at study start and again one year
   later.
        <p>In the group with EF less than 36%, nebivolol reduced heart size
   and improved EF 5%. Other measures remained the same. In patients with
   EF higher than 36%, no changes in the heart muscle were seen.
        <p>So in patients with weakly pumping hearts (low EF), nebivolol
   reduces heart size and improves EF. In patients with near-normal or
   normal EF (diastolic heart failure) no changes in the heart muscle
   were seen. None the less, risk of death or heart-related
   hospitalization improved in both groups in SENIORS.
        <p>The SENIORS trial showed that nebivolol reduces risk of death and
   heart-related hospitalizations in senior CHFers regardless of EF. What
   does this mean? It suggests that CHFers with diastolic heart failure
   may now have a drug proven to help them.
        <p>Jon's note : The average age in the SENIORS trial was 76 years.

   <h>Drugs and Exercise Tolerance

   <p>Exercise in a healthy person makes the heart relax more quickly and
   lowers LV pressure faster. The heart muscle actually stretches and
   gets larger when full of blood just before pumping it out. This
   increases EF. In a healthy person, these actions help the body handle
   exercise.
        <p>In DHF, those actions are very limited. The heart's stiffness
   prevents it from stretching to increase its size when filled with
   blood. EF does not rise, and patients get short of breath and very
   tired. Often, there is quite a rise in blood pressure and heart rate
   during exercise. The rise in blood pressure makes the heart work
   harder, which screws up the entire pumping cycle.
        <p>These changes increase diastolic pressures. High diastolic
   pressures reduce lung function and make breathing harder. Low heart
   output during exercise causes fatigue in the legs and other muscles.
        <p>Small trials show that calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers,
   and ARBs improve exercise ability in many DHF patients. However, these
   drugs do not always improve heart function.

   <h>Inotropes

   <p>Use inotropic drugs with caution. Since ejection fraction is often
   okay in DHF patients, inotropes may give no benefit at all. However,
   such drugs can cause harm in these patients. Inotropic drugs may help
   in the short-term for lung congestion but even short-term use may
   cause ischemia, speed up heart rate, or trigger arrhythmias.

   <h>Digoxin (Lanoxin, digitalis)

   <p>Digoxin (Lanoxin) strengthens the heart's pumping power. This
   increases energy demand, which may only show up during stress like
   exercise or ischemia, when digoxin can worsen diastolic function. With
   the exception of patients in chronic atrial fibrillation (to slow
   ventricular rate), digoxin is not recommended for DHF.

   <h>Coronary Artery Disease

   <p>In CAD, treatment should aim to reduce the heart's oxygen demand and
   increase blood flow to the heart. Drugs like nitrates
   (nitroglycerine), calcium channel blockers, and beta-blockers have all
   been shown to help. Clearing blocked arteries with angioplasty or CABG
   may also help diastolic heart failure patients with CAD.

   <h>Questions and Answers

   <p>Question
          <p>Is the rise in DHF cases caused by doctors better recognizing
          the condition or has there been an actual increase in the
          number of cases?

   <p>Dr. Zile
          <p>I think it is both. We are recognizing it better. Also, the
          general population is aging so high blood pressure, heart
          disease, and diabetes are rising just because they are more
          common in the elderly. Age itself causes changes in the heart
          that encourage DHF

   <p>Question
          <p>Why the controversy surrounding the diagnosis of DHF?

   <p>Dr. Zile
          <p>The guidelines that exist or have been proposed come from the
          European Cardiology Society and the Canadian Heart Society, as
          well as from a recent editorial by Vasan and Levy published in
          the journal Circulation. They all require that 3 standards be
          met to diagnose DHF:

          <l> signs and symptoms of heart failure
          <l>  normal EF
          <l> problems with diastolic function seen by cath or echo

          <p>I think these criteria are too tight and that number 3 should
          be eliminated. Ninety percent of patients who fit the first 2
          will indeed turn out to have diastolic heart failure confirmed
          by cath. The problem arises because measuring diastolic
          function with noninvasive tests like echo is difficult and
          confusing.
               <p>Why? Echo usually measures what we call the E and A
          velocities. However, E-wave velocity drops with age, heart
          enlargement, and DHF. So in someone with congested lungs and
          signs of high heart pressures those E-waves can appear normal.
          While the E-wave should be low in DHF patients, it may appear
          normal if the doctor is not experienced at treating diastolic
          heart failure.

   <p>Question
          <p>Is finding diastolic problems on an echo that is done for
          another reason important, even in a patient with no history or
          symptoms of CHF?

   <p>Dr. Zile
          <p>Yes. In systolic heart failure, a wide range of patient types
          is seen - from those with low EFs but no symptoms, to those
          with mild or moderate symptoms, to class 4 patients with severe
          symptoms even at rest. The same range is likely to be seen in
          diastolic heart failure patients

   <p>Question
          <p>Since most of the blood that fills the LV does so in the early
          part of the filling phase, why does it help to lengthen that
          phase in DHF patients by slowing heart rate? Doesn't increasing
          heart rate increase cardiac output?

   <p>Dr. Zile
          <p>While speeding up heart rate increases output, it also raises
          pressure, making symptoms worse. In a healthy person, raising
          heart rate does not change pressures much because the ventricle
          is able to relax faster as heart rate speeds up.
               <p>However, in DHF patients, the response to increased heart
          rate is not normal. When heart rate speeds up, the ventricle
          cannot relax any faster. This raises pressures. By slowing
          heart rate, you give the ventricle more time to relax, lowering
          filling pressures. Also, many DHF patients have ischemia. By
          slowing the heart rate, you reduce the heart's need for oxygen
          and that helps balance supply and demand of blood and oxygen

   <p>Question
          <p>Seeing that pretty much the same drugs are used to treat both
          diastolic are systolic heart failure, how important is it to
          tell DHF from SHF?

   <p>Dr. Zile
          <p>There are at least 40 well-done trials to guide treatment for
          systolic heart failure patients. This is not true for DHF, so
          its treatment is less certain. Even though we say ACE
          inhibitors will probably help and ARBs may help, and
          beta-blockers may help, and so on, it is not proven in large
          numbers of DHF patients. Also, there are differences in the way
          you use those drugs and in the doses you use.
               <p>The best example is beta-blockers. Treating heart failure
          in patients with an EF of 30% requires that beta-blocker dose
          be raised carefully, starting with tiny doses and raising it
          slowly over several months. In the DHF patient, that very slow
          rise in dose is not usually necessary.
               <p>Another example is calcium channel blockers. These drugs
          should not be used in systolic heart failure patients at all,
          but they may help DHF patients. As another example, diuretic
          use needs to be much more cautious in the DHF patient since
          drying them out too much can easily cause too-low blood
          pressure.
               <p>So even though the same drugs may be used to treat SHF and
          DHF, there are important differences. It is important for
          doctors to be aware of the differences when treating CHF
          patients

   <p>Question
          <p>Have beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers been shown to
          reverse measurements of diastolic dysfunction?

   <p>Dr. Zile
          <p>If you give beta-blockers to DHF patients, their relaxation
          rate gets worse instead of better. Despite this, patients feel
          better - so measurements don't always agree with how patients
          actually do while taking a drug. With calcium channel blockers,
          DHF patients feel better while taking them and their filling
          rates usually get better. There is a complex relationship
          between how any one drug affects a person versus how that drug
          affects the measurements we take of that person's heart
          function.
               <p>One study that used a calcium channel blocker and another
          study using an ARB showed improved exercise times in patients
          taking these drugs. However, neither study showed improved
          measurements of heart relaxation or stiffness. I don't think
          you can rely just on measures of heart function to guide
          treatment.

   <p>Question
          <p>In making a DHF diagnosis, what must be ruled out besides
          systolic heart failure?

   <p>Dr. Zile
          <p>Besides excluding SHF, it is also important to rule out mitral
          valve stenosis and chronic lung disease, both of which can
          imitate heart failure with a normal EF

   <p>Question
          <p>What blood pressure drugs are most likely to help heart
          enlargement in DHF patients?

   <p>Dr. Zile
          <p>Although it hasn't been clearly proven yet, I think drugs that
          alter the neurohormonal systems work well. They not only lower
          pressure, but they also reduce the effects of overactive bodily
          systems. The problem is that in most trials, heart enlargement
          only goes down about 10 to 15%. This will probably improve
          heart function but not totally reverse DHF. If those high blood
          pressure trials had been longer by 5 or 10 years, we might have
          seen more improvement proven down the road.
               <p>What evidence do I have to support that? The answer comes
          from patients with aortic stenosis who had their aortic valves
          replaced. Three to 5 years after aortic valve replacement,
          ventricular size and stiffness often returned to normal,
          improving the heart's stiffness and relaxation
