   like Richard

   <p>Hi! My
   name is Richard. You've never met me, but I'm one of the many people
   helped by the Children's Ability Fund. I am writing because I want to
   help this very special organization raise more
            money this year than ever before.

   <p>When I was just one year old, I had a stroke. This left me with a
   brain injury and in a wheelchair. I cannot speak much at all - but I
   have so much to say! For 9 years I used a Touch Talker to help me
   communicate with my family and friends. After awhile it kept breaking
   down. I was so good at typing it couldn't keep up to me!

   <p>When I started high school. I was so nervous. I was going to be
   meeting new friends and wanted to make sure I could talk to them so
   they could get to know me.

   <p>That's when I wrote to the Children's Ability Fund and asked them to
   help buy a new talking device. The one that I really liked was called
   the Delta Talker. I knew it would help me learn, meet new friends and
   become more independent.

   <p>Now so many great things have happened! I have my new talking device
   and have met many new friends at my school. I really enjoy visiting
   with them and I like to answer questions in class. My teachers say I
   am a good student, especially in science and math. This could not have
   happened without help from the Children's Ability Fund.

   <p>They have helped so many people like me. Now, I want others to feel as
   great as I do. Please help them help others. Make a donation today.
   Your donation will make a big difference to others - just like it did
   for me.

   <p>Thank you for reading my letter. Maybe someday I can show you my new
   talker.

  <h>Add to the Bursary Fund 
   <p>Some friends of the Children's Ability Fund
   chose to make a donation specifically to assist students with a
   disability. The Bursary Fund was established to ensure a continued
   commitment to providing an annual bursary to students in need through
   the               Children's Ability Fund Bursary.

   <h>Contribute to the Endowment Fund

   <p>Cassie talks using her toes on her Vanguard In 1987, the Endowment
   Fund was established to ensure the continuity and longevity of the
   organization and its goals and to ensure that the resources would be
   available to meet the growing demand our economy has placed on
   non-profit organizations to provide funding for the necessary
   equipment to people with disabilities.

   <p>Our target is $5,000,000 and we are happy to report that we have
   reached the half way mark.

   through the Planned Giving Program are invested and the resources are

   Ability Fund.

   for the Children's Ability Fund's programs for individuals and groups,
   like the Playground Project and the Bikes for Tykes Project.

   <p>There are many ways of making outright gifts, they share a common
   characteristic, they can used as soon as the gift is made.
     <l> Giving cash - whether by cheque, money order,     credit card or
       currency - is the most familiar way to     contribute to the
       Children's Ability Fund.
     <l>Giving appreciated property like stocks and bonds is becoming a
       more widely used     means of donating to a charity especially
       because of the favorable tax implications.
     <l> Giving a gift of a Certified Cultural Property allows donors
       special tax     considerations (there are also special guidelines
       that must be adhered to.)

   <h>Future Gifts...

   <p>Many people who would like to make a gift to charity cannot afford to
   during their lifetime. There are other ways of ensuring that those
   charities that are dear to you will receive a donation on your behalf.
     <l> Giving through your will. There are several alternatives for
       donating to a charity     through your will; a general bequest, a
       specific bequest, a residual bequest     designates, or a
       contingent bequest.
     <l> Life Insurance. There are several ways to make a future gift to a
       charity through     the purchase of a life insurance policy.

   <h>Gifts that Give Back...
   <p>Colin and Vista are our first team to have benefited from the New
   Leash on Life program. Vista is a golden retriever who has been
   trained as a guide dog and is now Colin's constant companion. She
   watchfully guides him through the hallways of Grant McEwan College,
   getting him safely to his destination. He is enrolled in a degree
   program majoring in Political Sceince. Upon completion, he hopes to
   enroll in the Faculty of Law. Gifts that provide lifetime income to a
   donor are a type of future gift. Some examples are:
     <l> gift annuities
     <l>	 charitable
     <l> remainder trusts
     <l> gifts of residual interest

   <p>Changes to the federal tax legislation have created more giving
   opportunities than ever before.
