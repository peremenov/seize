   <h>Back to the Garden
   <p>Our task is neither to shield nature from humanity nor to tame all
   wilderness.
   <p>A Christianity Today editorial
   <p>January 1, 2004

   <p>The heat continued long after the fires went out. Who was to blame for
   the fires that tarnished the Golden State? Those blazes killed 22
   residents, destroyed 3,600 homes, and burned over 750,000 acres. What
   could we do to stop it from happening again?

   <p>As any firefighter will tell you, the cause and the solution to
   wildfire is rarely simple. While those who started the fires should be
   held accountable, they were not responsible for the drought in Western
   states and other contributing factors that made the fires spread so
   quickly.

   <p>Chief among the culprits: dead and diseased trees, drying underbrush,
   and aggressive attempts to stamp out all fires (which led to
   accumulating deadwood), which have turned many Western forests into
   major wildfires in waiting. While some debate the effects of logging
   and livestock, almost everyone agrees that the quantity of easily
   ignitable fuel in several forests is, well, unnatural.

   <p>Underneath agreement on the problem, however, remains division on the
   nature of nature and our role in it. The debate will reignite, and the
   California wildfires vividly demonstrated that ecology is not purely
   academic. The Bible teaches Christians to embrace a theology in which
   God is both immanent in his creation and transcendent and beyond it;
   one in which humans are both part of God's creation and its subduers
   and caretakers. In short, though Adam and Eve's fall made our jobs
   more difficult, we still have the same job: we were created to be
   gardeners.

   <p>Our calling as stewards of creation is neither to protect nature from
   human "intrusion" nor to tame all wilderness. Some Christians have
   wrongly joined with Thoreau in romanticizing the outdoors; other
   Christians have taken another extreme. "In God's law neither man ...
