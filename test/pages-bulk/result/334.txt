<h>Fantasy wish list

   <p>I'm nerdy, no two ways about it: while thinking about the kind of
   things I would want for Christmas this year, I got to wondering about
   fictional gadgets and technology that I wouldn't at all mind having.
   So, as a perfectly goofy/nerdy/idle/self-amusing blog post, I put
   together a wish list of sci-fi/fantasy gadgets I'd like to get for
   Christmas (or my birthday).

   <p>(Incidentally, I do have an Amazon.com wish list here. It doesn't
   necessarily match the list I made for my family this year, but I'm
   just sayin'.)

   <h>Lightsaber

   <p>Forget laser guns, a lightsaber is the perfect all-in-one weapon. The
   blade is indestructible, cuts through anything, deflects energy
   blasts, and acts as a flashlight. Plus, when you're done slicing up
   Sith Lords, it has a ton of household uses.

   <h>Tricorder

   <p>The ultimate all-purpose scanning device and handheld computer. As the
   various Star Trek series show, there's really nothing your tricorder
   can't tell you--from general weather and environmental conditions to
   the movements and stats of hidden people to the spin orientation of
   quarks.

   <h>Sonic Screwdriver

   <p>Doctor Who's miracle tool. There was almost nothing he couldn't do
   with that thing... repairing any machine... unlocking any door...
   cooking meals... getting cash from ATMs...

   <h>Time-traveling DeLorean... or TARDIS

   <p>Gotta have a time machine.

   <p>For vehicular transport, I can't decide between these two. If I went
   with the DeLorean, I'd have to go with the fusion-powered flying
   version, but then I'd run into various hijinks related to the
   existence of magical automobiles in the wrong era. And, of course, the
   hassle of being able to get the car up to (arbitrarily) 88 miles per
   hour just to get anywhen. Plus, it doesn't travel spatially--you
   travel to the same corresponding point in space in the different time
   period. Could be a problem if there's a building there in the future
   or something.

   <p>But, the thing looks cool.

   <p>On the other hand, Doctor Who's TARDIS travels both temporally and
   spatially, and is bigger on the inside than the outside. Drawbacks?
   Doesn't seem like you actually have much control over where and when
   you travel. Plus, it always seems to look like a goofy blue police
   box. Or, at least the Doctor's did. Perhaps I could get one of my own,
   an updated, working model.

   <h>Babel fish

   <p>Yeah, this isn't a gadget per se, but man, being able to understand
   and communicate in any language without having to fiddle around with
   something as cumbersome as a Universal Translator...

   <p>That's all I can come up with right now. Though I'm sure somebody will
   point out that since I chose a Babel fish from The Hitchhiker's Guide
   to the Galaxy, that I should choose, well, "The Hitchhiker's Guide to
   the Galaxy" as a must-have gadget. Nah. I figure I'll just load
   Wikipedia onto my tricorder.

<h>I was interviewed about Lost...

   <p>Based on what I've been writing (ranting) about "Lost" recently, I was
   contacted via email by a woman doing a feature story about the subject
   who wanted to interview me (also via email).

   <p>The twist? It's a Brazilian [DEL: television :DEL] Lost fan site
   entirely in Portuguese.

   <p>Globalization, ya gotta love it. It's cool seeing my name and site in
   print, even if I don't know what the article is saying. It's here:
   "LOST" JÁ ERA? TEMPORADA DESANIMA FÃS E PERDE AUDIÊNCIA NOS EUA.

   <p>Guess it's time to fire up the Google translator...

<h>Hack Bend holiday shopping guide

   <p>A little cross-pollination: over on Hack Bend I'm going to be posting
   a Holiday Shopping Guide, and I want to make it collaborative as well
   as listing my own opinions on where to shop for the holidays.

   <p>So if you live in Central Oregon and have any recommendations or want
   a piece of the action, let me know, or comment on my Hack Bend post.

   <p>Cheers!

<h>These Santas are so wrong

   <p>SouthFlorida.com is running a photo gallery of kids scared of Santa
   Claus, which is gut-busting funny. (Really! I laughed out loud at a
   lot of these.) But some of these Santas are so messed up that I had to
   re-run them here. (But go check out the rest.)

   <p>Like this one...


   <p>Or this one:


   <p>More...

                                 

   <p>And while those are fun, what the hell is with these fake Santas?

    <p>Holy shit this freaks me out... it's like Night of the Corn Santa or
                                 something

   <p>And finally, I think we have what qualifies as Worst Santa Ever:

<h>I need this gum.

   <p>For real.


   <p>November 29, 2006

<h>What's shakin'?

   <p>Yes, I'm aware I haven't posted much here on chuggnutt.com lately.
   I've been focusing most of my writing energy on The Brew Site and Hack
   Bend recently, since I keep thinking of topical things for those blogs
   and I really don't want to become a caricature of myself with "Lost"
   rants.

   <p>Aside from that, here's a loosely-presented list of things that have
   been happening:

   <p>Thanksgiving was very nice, and low-key. We did the expected big
   dinner at my parents' house, though we weren't a big crowd. We made
   some excellent pumpkin pies with a gingerbread graham cracker crust.
   (Gingerbread graham crackers. Seriously. Rachael Ray is on the box.)

   <p>I hung outdoor Christmas lights on the house the day after
   Thanksgiving. The cold air gave me a bit of a cold.

   <p>The day after that consisted of generously picking up weary travelers
   Shannon and Brian from the Redmond Airport; Shannon confessed a creepy
   desire to pummel saguaro cacti. Whack job. :)

   <p>The two recent books I've read/are reading are Stephen Baxter's
   Manifold: Time and Manifold: Space. I think Time is the better written
   of the two, where he actually builds characterizations (mostly; he's
   not as strong here as some writers) for his cast, whereas in Space
   they feel more like mouthpieces or conveniences. Maybe he just got
   lazy, since he's sort of continuing the main character's story, and
   didn't feel necessary to rehash... or not. I don't know. They're full
   of interesting concepts, nonetheless.

   <p>When I get a chance (which isn't often), I've been thoroughly enjoying
   "Secret Weapons Over Normandy" for the PlayStation 2. That game
   completely rocks. I didn't think I'd like it as much as I do; I think
   a big part of that is the relatively simple controls used.

   <p>(Yes, that's me: I need simple video game controls. I'm retro that
   way.)

   <p>Anything else? Um... working. Nothing interesting to report there.


   <p>November 23, 2006

<h>Happy Thanksgiving!

   <p>I hope everyone's Thanksgiving is a good one. We're baking pumpkin
   pies today (made with a gingerbread graham cracker crust) and heading
   out to my folks' house for dinner and family. Enjoy the long weekend!


   <p>November 16, 2006

<h>About those people waiting in line for a PS3...

   <p>Something I don't really get about those people (mostly young?)
   waiting--no, camping--in line for days outside of stores like Best Buy
   for the PlayStation 3... Do they not have jobs, that they can take the
   time to spend a week camping out at a store? And if they don't have
   jobs, how can they afford to buy something as expensive as the PS3 (at
   $600)?

   <p>Of course, I don't get why people would camp out for movie premieres,
   either. YMMV.

<h>Obligatory Lost post

   <p>I'm starting to think I'm becoming a parody of myself with these
   "Lost" posts. I'm also thinking about coining a new phrase: "to pull a
   Lost." It should be self-evident what I mean by that, but: to start
   out strong, have everything going your way... and then blow it. Which
   seems to be what they're doing.

   <p>Actually, last night's episode was better than it has been this
   season... mostly. I'll get into that below after the obligatory
   spoiler warning...

   <p>Here there be spoilers!

<h>The truth about vampires

   <p>I realize I'm about a week late blogging this item (should have been
   around Halloween), but I just can't resist: Count Dracula not in the
   numbers, physicist says. A scientist is playing Scully to
   scientifically disprove the existence of monsters--vampires, zombies,
   ghosts, and so on.

   <p>Articles like this make me amused and irritated at the same time. I
   always get a kick of out it when a goofy, kooky topic like this shows
   up in the "serious" mainstream news, but it annoys me when they
   purport to have The Answer to things and get their science and logic
   wrong.

   <p>Case in point: his proof against the existence of vampires is flawed:

     <p>[Costas] Efthimiou takes out the calculator to prove that if a
     vampire sucked one person's blood each month -- turning each victim
     into an equally hungry vampire -- after a couple of years there
     would be no people left, just vampires. He started his calculations
     with just one vampire and 537 million humans on January 1, 1600 and
     shows that the human population would be down to zero by July 1602.

   <p>Now I'm not saying that vampires do exist, but that's weak. Yes,
   you've shown us that repeatedly doubling a number increases it
   exponentially very quickly, but this "proof" is hardly proof. First of
   all, why the assumption that vampires always make more vampires? If
   the vampire doesn't kill you outright, then you become a vampire. I
   think it's up to the "source" vampire. No exponential increase.

   <p>Second, couldn't some of these vampires be feeding on animals instead
   of humans? (Digression: wouldn't vampire cows be funny?)

   <p>Third, I'm sure vampires are reasonably intelligent enough to have
   figured out that if they keep making vampires, there's no more food
   left. I imagine they plan accordingly.

   <p>Fourth, where did this "one person per month" figure come from? That
   seems rather arbitrary.

   <p>So his reasoning is flawed. I think he would be better off arguing
   against the more implausible vampire myths, such as the physical
   impossibility of their not casting reflections in mirrors.

   <p>Or, you know, doing real science.

<h>Lost A-Team mashup

   <p>I love this video mashup of Lost and The A-Team. I might even like it
   better than the actual third season of "Lost" so far!


<h>Protolariat

   <p>This entry stems entirely from a gross misspelling/mishandling of the
   word "proletariat" on my part. "Protolariat" is not a real word; if
   you search for it nothing comes up. What better opportunity to create
   a new word and be the only search engine result for it? :)

   <p>So, what should the definition be? I'm thinking something along the
   lines of:
     <l> An incomplete model of string theory
     <l> A poorly-executed or work-in-progress "Web 2.0" site; possibly
       derogatory. "Friendster is a real protolariat"
     <l> Mushroom juice
     <l> A long piece of rope with a knot at one end

   <p>Coining new words with the power of the internet!


   <p>November 6, 2006

<h>Kids + illness + birthday = entirely too busy

   <p>The "illness" referred to in the title above is our daughter's; she
   isn't seriously sick but has this cough that really kicks in after
   she's been asleep for a few hours, and this happens two or three times
   a night. It really sucks to have your sleep punctured every couple of
   hours to go administer meds or water or whatever.

   <p>Anyway. It was also our daughter's birthday weekend, so we were
   running around a lot getting things ready and such. The birthday party
   went really well, so that's good. Thankfully they seem to get easier
   as the kids get older and more autonomous. No need to give the little
   ones booze and sleep it off anymore.

   <p>I'm kidding. (Or am I?)

   <p>The only hitch was two kids didn't get picked up; turns out the mom
   who was supposed to be picking them up went to the wrong place.
   Fortunately, we had our minivan and cellphones, so we were able to
   take the extra kids to where they needed to be. That may well have
   been the first time we've carpooled...

   <p>Anyway, I'll try to get back to my regular blogging schedule. Which
   hasn't been very "regular" of late, I know. I'll get right on that...
   sometime...

<h>More Lost braindump

   <p>No, this won't be quite the rant I did last week, just thoughts since
   watching tonight's episode of "Lost." In particular I thought
   tonight's Eko-centric episode was far better than last week's, but
   most of this is just braindump. Maybe some ranting. And oh yeah, huge
   spoilers.

   <p>Huge spoilers ahead, don't say I didn't warn you...
