   <h>Give Until You're Conservative
   <p>I have no social science study saying liberals are more or less rich
   than conservatives. But what must the future hold -- demographically
   speaking -- if Who Really Cares, a new book based on social science
   about charity in America by Arthur Brooks, is right?

   <h>Prudence is Morally Superior to Ideology

   <p>The United States is founded on the premise that human beings are
   governed by "the laws of nature and of nature's God," which declare
   "that all men are created equal" in their rights to "life, liberty and
   the pursuit of happiness." This is not a mere "ideology" but the moral
   truth...

   <h>If this be moderation
   <p>Former Iranian President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani has won election
   to the Iranian government's Assembly of Experts -- or "Expediency
   Council," depending on the translation -- and the Western press is
   covering the event with all the perspicacity it can muster...

   <h>People Who Need People
   <p>Of late, I have been reading Mark Steyn's fine new book, America
   Alone. In brief, Steyn argues that the Occident is being

   <h>Surging To Failure
   <p>If there is a motto for the Bush Administration's war policy, it is,
   "Doing the Right Thing Wrongly." Never have such good intentions been
   marred by such relentlessly poor execution...

   <h>Are The Rich Getting Richer?
   <p>Over the weekend, The Wall Street Journal put a fine op-ed Alan
   Reynolds on the web. Reynolds shows that studies showing an increasing
   "wealth gap" in America may very well be flawed...

   <h>Silly Babbitt...
   <p>The latest pearl of wisdom gleaned from Democracy and Leadership. Not
   much has changed since the 1920s: With the present trend towards
   `social justice,' the time is rapidly approaching when...

   <h>Couplings
   <p>The New Jersey Legislature yesterday voted to create "civil unions"
   for homosexuals who prefer a legal veneer to their couplings and

<h>Quote

   <p>"There are more instances of the abridgement of the freedom of the
   people by gradual and silent encroachments of those in power than by
   violent and sudden usurpations."
   <p>-James Madison, Speech to the Virginia Ratifying Convention, June 16,
   1788.
