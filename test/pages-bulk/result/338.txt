     <p>Montagnais women help Oblate priest translate sacred works

     <h>Psalms and New Testament
     in Innu language off the press

     <p>Oblate Father Joseph Pirson was translating the
     texts of the different Masses in his little mission parish in the
     Diocese of Baie-Comeau in Northern Quebec when an idea dawned on
     him: "I realized that it would be good to have all the psalms
     translated in Innu language."

     <p>His work, started 20 years ago, has since been expanded to include
     the New Testament. The work of two decades has recently been
     published in two volumes: Aiamieu-Nikamun Mashinaikan, a
     translation of the Book of Psalms, and Sheshust-Kanisht: Inniun
     Uttaimun, a translation of the New Testament.

     <p>Fr. Pirson envisioned the book to be read at home by the native
     people.

     <p>"The Montagnais Indians do not have a lot of materials published in
     their language."

     <p>Two Montagnais women, Mrs. Celine Bellefleur and Mrs. Philomena
     Gregoire from Sept-Îles, Quebec, did most of the work, says Fr.
     Pirson. "They were perfect translators. They know their own
     language very well as well as French."

     <p>The first book on the New Testament is the most
     important, says Fr. Pirson, and required more collaboration from
     the Innu community.

     <p>Fr. Pirson was born on April 20, 1924, in the town of Corbion sur
     Semois in Belgium. He took his first vows as an Oblate Missionary
     of Mary Immaculate on September 8, 1943, and served as a priest
     with the Diocese of Namur, also in Belgium.

     <p>He came to Canada in early 1949, and was assigned to Richmond Gulf,
     a mission on the East Coast of Hudson Bay for two years. Then his
     bishop, Bishop Lionel Scheffer of Labrador City-Schefferville in
     Newfoundland and Labrador, sent him to Davis Inlet on the Labrador
     coast to learn a native language--Montagnais--with another Oblate,
     Father Joseph Cyr.

     <p>"The next year," he says, "the bishop sent me to Northwest River
     also on Labrador coast, to establish a mission among the native
     people there, and where I stayed 20 years."

     <p>In 1972, he went back to Davis Inlet for two years.

     <p>In 1974, he left the Labrador coast to minister
     in the North Shore of St. Lawrence River, in a community called
     Sept-Îles, or Seven Islands. After a year, he went to Betsiamites,
     a Montagnais community in Northern Quebec. He served for 30 years
     in these two missions, and went for brief stints to La Romaine
     (another native village), St. Augustine, and Mont Joli.

     <p>Working in Bestsiamites , a community of 3,000 people, had been "a
     very pleasant experience," he recollects. "Sometimes it was hard,
     but most of the time it was a happy time."

     <p>In all, Fr. Pirson has served the missions for 55 years. He says he
     would recommend others to do the same ministry. "More than ever,
     the people need to receive the good news of Jesus Christ. I was
     happy to be close to the people and to their life, and to fulfil my
     missionary vocation." Since his retirement in 2002, Fr. Pirson has
     been living in Betsiamites, Northern Quebec.
