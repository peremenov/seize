  <h>   THE IMPERIAL GLASS COMPANY

    <p>The Imperial Glass Company was established in 1901 by an ex-riverboat
   captain and experienced glassmaker Edward Muhleman, although they
   didn't begin producing the iridescent Carnival glass for which they
   became best known until 1909. In the early days of its formation it
   made pressed glass as was the fashion of the day, glasses, compotes,
   bowls, and other household tableware and accessories. In 1904,
   Imperial moved into a new facility on the river in Bellaire, Ohio,
   already a center of American glassmaking. When they began making
   Carnival glass, it immediately became their most popular production
   line and it was produced in huge quantities for middle America and
   beyond. Imperial was closely identified with more sculptural and
   geometric forms than contemporaries like Fenton and Northwood, who
   became better known for evoking nature through grapes, leaves, and
   other natural shapes. Imperial produced a much wider variety of glass
   than simply Carnival glass however, although they always made more
   utilitarian pieces than their contemporaries and as such bring in
   general slightly lower prices in today's market. They produced new
   colors such as "smoke", a light blueish-grey color, and "clambroth",
   much the color of ginger ale, and they produced marigold glass in huge
   quantities. In their Carnival glass lines, they were particularly well
   known for the rich iridescence of their pieces and especially their
   purple glass which was much less commonly found from other
   manufacturers.

   <p>Many of the staffers at Imperial were German and Bohemian craftsmen
   who had been influenced and skilled in the work of Austrian and
   Bohemian producers of the period such as Loetz, and they sought to
   bring ever more highly skilled techniques to Imperial production. They
   produced almost the total spectrum of American glass styles of the era
   including slag glass, stretch glass, opalescent glass, milk glass,
   black glass, and novelty glass animals. Imperial was more successful
   than most other American manufacturer's of Carnival glass in exporting
   to Europe, and they continued to operate through the depression years
   of the 1930s in producing a cheaper range of green, pink, and blue
   Depression glass from earlier Imperial Glass molds. Candlewick glass
   was a pattern of elegant depression era glass produced in the 1930's
   by the Imperial Glass Company, still popular for entertaining because
   of the sheer variety of service pieces available. Candlewick glassware
   is recognized by the bead work, usually found at the edges of a plate
   or on the stem of a cake plate. What sets it apart from other, similar
   glassware of the era is the quality and clarity of the glass.

   <p>Imperial stayed in business through the hears of World War II and even
   began producing reproduction Carnival glass in the 1960s as collector
   interest began to be revived. They also acquired other struggling but
   formerly well known glass companies including A. H. Heisey in 1958 and
   Cambridge Glass Works in 1960. Using the old molds, Imperial continued
   to produce Heisey and Cambridge designs marketed as Heisey or
   Cambridge "by Imperial." Lenox bought the company in 1973, beginning a
   period of decline until finally ceasing operations in 1983.
