                          <h>SPEECH OF SIR SYED AHMED
                             AT LUCKNOW [1887]

     <p>A LECTURE was given by the Hon'ble Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, before a
     large and very influential audience of Mahomedans in Lucknow,on
     18th December, 1887, at 8.30 P.M., in the Baradari, Kaisarbagh, on
     the attitude the Mahomedan community ought to assume towards the
     Government,the political questions of the day, and the Bengali
     movement. The meeding was attended not only by the Mahomedans of
     Lucknow, but by gentlemen who had come from all parts of Upper India
     to be present at the Mahomedan Educational Congress. It represented
     the intellect and the aristocracy, the brain and the muscle, of the
     Mahomedan community. There were present the taluqdars of Oudh,
     members of the Government Services, the Army, the Professionsof
     Law, the Press and the Priesthood; Syeds, Shaikhs, Moghals and
     Pathans belonging to some of the noblest families in India; and
     representatives of every school of thought, from orthodox Sunni and
     Shiah Maulvis to the young men trained in Indian colleges or in
     England. The Syed's speech lasted an hour and a half, and was
     delivered with great eloquence. It was received with enthusiastic
     applause. The chair was occupied by Munshi Imtiaz Ali,the
     legal adviser of the Oudh Taluqdars' Association, a
     distinguished pleader belonging to an ancient and noble Arab family
     of Oudh. The speech was delivered in Urdu, taken down by Munshi
     Aziz-ud-din, and afterwards revised by Sir Syed himself. The
     substance of the lecture was as follows:--

       <p>{1} GENTLEMEN,--I am not given to speaking on politics, and I
   do not recollect having ever previously given a political lecture. My
   attention has always been directed towards the education of my brother
   Mahomedans, for from education I anticipate much benefit for my people,
   for Hindustan, and for the Government.But at the present time
   circumstances have arisen which make it necessary for me, I think, to
   tell my brother Musalmans clearly what my opinions are. The object,
   gentlemen, of this lecture is to explain the attitude which the
   Mahomedan community ought to adopt with regard to the
   political movements of the time. I am not going to give a philosophical
   discourse, nor to speak of those abstract questions on political
   economy which would require many lectures fully to deal with; but I am
   simply going to express my opinions in a plain and straightforward
   manner, leaving it to everyone who hears me to agree with me or differ
   from me. The reason why I stand here to address you today is because
   there has grown up in India a political agitation, and it is necessary
   to determine what action should be taken by the Mahomedan community
   with regard to it. Although my own thoughts and desires are towards my
   own community, yet I shall discuss whether or not this agitation
   is useful for the country and for the other nations who live in it. If
   it be useful, we must follow it; but if dangerous for the country or
   our nation, we must hold aloof.

       <p>{2} Before I enter on this subject, let me briefly describe
   the methods of rule adopted by our Government, which has now been here
   for nearly a hundred years. Its method is this: to keep in its own
   hands all questions of foreign policy and all matters affecting its
   army. I hope that we, who are subjects of the Empire, will not seek to
   interfere in those matters which Government has set apart as its own.
   If the Government fight Afghanistan or conquer Burma, it is no business
   of ours to criticise its policy. Our interests will not suffer from
   these matters being left in the hands of Government. But we are
   concerned with matters affecting internal policy; and we have to
   observe what method Government has adopted for dealing with them.
   Government has made a Council for making laws affecting the lives,
   property, and comfort of the people. For this Council she selects from
   all Provinces those officials who are best acquainted with the
   administration and the condition of thepeople, and also
   some Raïses who, on account of their high social position, are worthy
   of a seat in that assembly.

       <p>{3}Some people may ask Why should they be chosen on account
   of social position instead of ability? On this, gentlemen, I will say a
   few words. It is a great misfortune and I [ask your pardon for
   saying it that the landed gentry of India have not the trained ability
   which makes them worthy of occupying those seats. But you must not
   neglect those circumstances which compel Government to adopt this
   policy. It is very necessary that for the Viceroy's Council the members
   should be of high social position.I ask you Would our aristocracy like
   that a man of low caste or insignificant origin, though he be a B.A.or
   M.A., and have the requisite ability, should be in a position of
   authority above them and have power in making laws that affect their
   lives and property? Never! Nobody would like it. (Cheers.) A seat in
   the Council of the Viceroy is a position of great honour and prestige.
   None but a man of good breeding can the Viceroy take as his colleague,
   treat as his brother, and invite to entertainments at which he may have
   to dine with Dukes and Earls. Hence no blame can be attached to
   Government for making those great Raïses members of the Council. It is
   our great misfortune that our Raïses are such that they are unable to
   devise laws useful for the country.

       <p>{4} The method of procedure in the Council is this. If any
   member introduce a subject of importance and difficulty, a commission
   is appointed which collects evidence and digests it. The matter is
   discussed in every newspaper,and memorials are invited from
   Associations. The Council then discusses the matter, every member
   speaking his views with great vigour and earnestness, more even than
   was displayed in the discussion on the third resolution in the
   Mahomedan Educational Congress, advocating what he thinks necessary
   for the welfare of the country; and as regardless of the Viceroy's
   presence as if he were a figure of white stone. I have had the honour
   of being in this Council. I do not recollect any matter of importance
   concerning which ten or twenty memorials were not sent in. A Select
   Committee was then appointed, which read through these memorials and
   discussed them at length, many of which on consideration turned out to
   be thorough nonsense. Extracts from Urdu papers were also considered.
   Although not in my presence, yet often amendments suggested by these
   memorials have been adopted. This is the method of our
   Government. After this the law is passed and sent to the Secretary of
   State, who is assisted by the Council of State, which consists of men
   of the highest ability, who have lived for a long time in India and
   have often held all offices, from that of Assistant Collector to
   Lieutenant-Governor. If they think it expedient it is passed, otherwise
   a short note of four lines cancels it. Often people make objections to
   the laws so passed, and in some cases they are perhaps right; but in
   the majority of cases, as far as my experience goes, those very people
   who sit in their houses and make objections would, if they had been on
   the Viceroy's Council, have supported them. Many details appear wrong
   on superficial consideration, but when all the circumstances and
   difficulties are taken into account, they are seen to be
   right. In conclusion, whether the laws be good or bad, no one can say
   that Government acts independently of the wishes and opinions of its
   subjects. Often it adopts some of the views expressed in newspapers and
   memorials. Can we say that Government, in the method it has adopted for
   legislation, acts without regard to the opinions of the people? Can we
   say that we have no share in the making of the laws? Most certainly
   not. (Cheers.)

       <p>{5} There is now another great duty of Government. That is,
   that in whatever country Government establishes its dominion, that
   dominion should be made strong, firm, and secure. I believe that if any
   of my friends were made Viceroy; he would be as loyal to Her Majesty
   the Queen-Empress of India as is our present Viceroy, Lord Dufferin.
   And his first duty would be to see that the Empire of Her Majesty were
   made so firm that no enemy, external, or internal, could shake it.
   (Cheers.) If it were my fortune to be Viceroy; I speak from my heart
   when I say I would not be equally, but more, anxious to see the rule of
   the Queen placed on a firm basis. (Cheers.) It is a first principle of
   Empire that it is the supreme duty of everyone, whether Hindustani or
   Englishman, in whose power it rests, to do what he can to strengthen
   the Government of Her Majesty the Queen. The second duty of Government
   is to preserve peace, to give personal freedom, to protect life and
   property; to punish criminals, and to decide civil disputes. Now,
   everyone will admit that Government completely fulfils its duty in this
   respect.

       <p>{6} Many people think that the laws have become too
   numerous; and consequently that lawsuits have become more complicated,
   and thus lead to disputes between the zamindar and the kashtkar.
   But this is the opinion of the critics who sit in their houses, who if
   they sat on the Viceroy's Council would change their views. The
   multiplicity of laws depends upon the condition of the country and of
   its people. New companies and new industries are springing into
   existence. New and unforeseen legal rights have arisen which are not
   provided for in the Mahomedan law. Hence, when the country is changing
   at such a rate, it is absolutely necessary that new laws should be
   brought forward to deal with the new circumstances. Government does not
   want to increase the number of laws, but when the conditions of the
   country change, it becomes unavoidable. Taking all these things into
   account, I cannot but think that there is no requirement of the
   country that cannot be brought to the notice of Government. And nothing
   can prevent our expressing our views on the subject and being heard by
   Government. So that whatever comfort we can experience under any
   Government, we have under the British Government. (Cheers.)

       <p>{7} I come now to the main subject on which I wish to
   address you. That is The National Congress and the demands which that
   body makes of Government.I cannot allude to its proposals in
   detail because, as far as I am aware, there are forty-nine of them, and
   the time at my disposal is short. I must therefore select the most
   important. That about which the greatest agitation has taken place is
   the following. When the Government of India passed out of the hands of
   the East India Company into those of the Queen, a law was passed saying
   that all subjects of Her Majesty, whether white or black, European or
   Indian, should be equally eligible for appointments. This was confirmed
   by the Queen's Proclamation. We have to see whether, in the rules made
   for admission to civil appointments, any exception has been made
   to this or not; whether we have been excluded from any appointments for
   which we are fitted. Nobody can point out a case in which for any
   appointment a distinction of race has been made. It is true that for
   the Covenanted Civil Service a special set of rules has been made;
   namely, that candidates have to pass a competitive examination in
   England. Perhaps it will occur to everyone that this examination ought
   not to be held in England, and the proposal about which the greatest
   agitation has taken place is that it should be.held in India. And to
   this is added another proposal that all posts in the subordinate
   service, from that of Tahsildar to Subordinate Judge, should also be
   given by competitive examination.

       <p>{8} I do not think it necessary for me on this occasion to
   discuss the question why the competitive examination is held in
   England, and what would be the evils arising from its
   transference to India. But I am going to speak of the evils likely to
   follow the introduction into India of the competitive principle. I do
   not wish to speak in the interest of my own co-religionists, but to
   express faithfully whether I think the country is prepared for
   competitive examination or not. What is the result of
   competitive examination in England? You know that men of all social
   positions, sons of Dukes or Earls, of darzies and people of low rank,
   are equally allowed to pass this examination. Men of both high and low
   family come to India in the Civil Service. And it is the universal
   belief that it is not expedient for Government to bring the men of low
   rank; and that the men of good social position treat Indian gentlemen
   with becoming politeness, maintain the prestige of the British race,
   and impress on the hearts of the people a sense of British justice,and
   are useful both to Government and to the country. But those who
   come from England, come from a country so far removed from our eyes
   that we do not know whether they are the sons of Lords or Dukes or of
   darzies; and therefore if those who govern us are of  humble rank, we
   cannot perceive the fact. But as regards Indians, the case is
   different. Men of good family would never like to trust their lives and
   property to people of low rank with whose humble origin they are well
   acquainted. (Cheers.)

       <p>{9} Leave this a moment, and consider what are the
   conditions which makethe introduction into a country of
   competitive examinations expedient,and then see whether our own
   country is ready for it or not. This is no difficult question of
   political economy. Everyone can understand that the first condition for
   the introduction of competitive examination into a country is that all
   people in that country, from the highest to thc lowest, should belong
   to one nation. In such a country no particular difficulties are likely
   to arise. The second case is that of a country in which there are two
   nationalities which have become so united as to be practically one
   nation. England and Scotland are a case in point. In the past many wars
   were waged between those countries, and many acts of bravery were done
   on both sides; but those times have gone, and they are now like
   one nation. But this is not the case with our country, which is peopled
   with different nations. Consider the Hindus alone. The Hindus of our
   Province, the Bengalis of the East, and the Mahrattas of the Deccan, do
   not form one nation. If in your opinion the peoples of India do form
   one nation, then no doubt competitive examination may be introduced;
   but if this be not so, then competitive examination is not suited to
   the country. The third case is that of a country in which there are
   different nationalities which are on an equal footing as regards the
   competition, whether they take advantage of it or not. Now, I ask you,
   have Mahomedans attained to such a position as regards higher English
   education, which is necessary for higher appointments, as to put them
    on a level with Hindus or not? Most certainly not. Now I take
   Mahomedans and the Hindus of our Province together, and ask whether
   they are able to compete with the Bengalis or not? Most certainly not.
   When this is the case, how can competitive examination be introduced
   into our country? (Cheers.)

       <p>{10} Think for a moment what would be the result if all
   appointments were given by competitive examination. Over all races, not
   only over Mahomedans but over Rajas of high position and the brave
   Rajputs who have not forgotten the swords of their ancestors, would be
   placed as ruler a Bengali who at sight of a table knife would crawl
   under his chair. (Uproarious cheers and laughter.) There would remain
   no part of the country in which we should see at the tables of justice
   and authority any face except those of Bengalis. I am delighted to see
   the Bengalis making progress, but the question is What would be the
   result on the administration of the country? Do you think that the
   Rajput and the fiery Pathan, who are not afraid of being hanged or of
   encountering the swords of the police or the bayonets of the army,
   could remain in peace under the Bengalis? (Cheers.) This would be the
   outcome of the proposal if accepted. Therefore if any of you men of
   good position, Raïses, men of the middle classes, men of noble family
   to whom God has given sentiments of honour if you accept that the
   country should groan under the yoke of Bengali rule and its people lick
   the Bengali shoes, then, in the name of God! jump into the train, sit
   down, and be off to Madras, be off to Madras! (Loud cheers
   and laughter.) But if you think that the prosperity and honour of the
   country would be ruined, then, brothers, sit in your houses, inform
   Government of your circumstances, and bring your wants to its notice in
   a calm and courteous manner.

       <p>{11} The second demand of the National Congress is that the
   people should elect a section of the Viceroy's Council. They want to
   copy the English House of Lords and the House of Commons. The elected
   members are to be like members of the House of Commons; the appointed
   members like the House of Lords. Now, let us suppose the Viceroy's
   Council [to be] made in this manner. And let us suppose first of all
   that we have universal sufferage, as in America, and that everybody,
   chamars and all, have votes. And first suppose that all the Mahomedan
   electors vote for a Mahomedan member, and all Hindu electors for a
   Hindu member; and now count how many votes the Mahomedan members have
   and how many the Hindu. It is certain the Hindu members will have four
   times as many, because their population is four times as numerous.
   Therefore we can prove by mathematics that there will be four votes for
   the Hindu to every one vote for the Mahomedan. And now how can the
   Mahomedan guard his interests? It would be like a game of dice in which
   one man had four dice, and the other only one.

       <p>{12} In the second place, suppose that the electorate
   be limited. Somemethod of qualification must be made; for example,
   that people with a certain income shall be electors. Now, I ask you, O
   Mahomedans! Weep at your condition! Have you such wealth that you can
   compete with the Hindus? Most certainly not. Suppose, for example, that
   an income of Rs. 5,000 a year be fixed on, how many Mahomedans will
   there be? Which party will have the larger number of votes? I put aside
   the case that by a rare stroke of luck a blessing comes through the
   roof, and some Mahomedan is elected. In the normal case no single
   Mahomedan will secure a seat in the Viceroy's Council. The
   whole Council will consist of Babu So-and-so Mitter, Babu So-and-So
   Ghose, and Babu So-and-so Chuckerbutty.(Laughter.) Again, what will
   be the result for the Hindus of our Province, though their condition be
   better than that of the Mahomedans? What will be the result for those
   Rajputs, the swords of whose ancestors are still wet with blood? And
   what will be the result for the peace of the country? Is there any hope
   that we and our brave brothers the Rajputs can endure it in silence?

       <p>{13} Now, we will suppose a third kind of election. Suppose
   a rule to be made that a suitable number of Mahomedans and a suitable
   number of Hindus are to be chosen. I am aghast when I think on what
   grounds this number is likely to be determined. Of necessity,
   proportion to total population will be taken. So there will be one
    number for us to every four for the Hindus. No other condition
   can be laid down. Then they will have four votes and we shall have one.

       <p>{14} Now, I will make a fourth supposition. Leaving aside
   the question as to the suitability of members with regard to
   population, let us suppose that a rule is laid down that half the
   members are to be Mahomedan and half Hindus, and that the Mahomedans
   and Hindus are each to elect their own men. Now, I ask you to pardon me
   for saying something which I say with a sore heart. In the whole nation
   there is no person who is equal to the Hindus in fitness for the work.
   I have worked in the Council for four years, and I have always known
   well that there can be no man more incompetent or worse fitted for the
   post than myself. ("No, No!") And show me the man who, when elected,
   will leave his business and undertake the expense of living in Calcutta
   and Simla, leaving alone the trouble of the journeys. Tell me who there
   is of our nation in the Punjab, Oudh, and North-Western Provinces who
   will leave his business, incur these expenses, and attend the Viceroy's
   Council for the sake of his countryrnen. When this is the condition of
   your nation, is it expedient for you to take part in this business, on
   the absurd supposition that the demands of the Congress would, if
   granted, be beneficial for the country? Spurn such foolish notions.It
   is certainly not expedient to adopt this cry Chalo Madras! Chalo
   Madras!without thinking of the consequences.

       <p>{15} Besides this there is another important
   consideration, which is this. Suppose that a man of our own nationality
   were made Viceroy of India; that is, the deputy of Her Most Gracious
   Majesty the Queen-Empress. Could such a person grant demands like
   these, keeping in view the duty of preserving the Empire on a firm and
   secure basis? Never! Then how absurd to suppose that the British
   Government can grant these requests! The result of these unrealisable
   and impossible proposals can be only this: that for a piece of sheer
   nonsense, the hearts of everybody will be discontented with
   Government; and everybody will believe that Government exerts over us a
   tyrannical rule, and turns a deaf ear to our requests. And thus anger
   and excitement will spread throughout the people, and the peace of the
   country will be destroyed.

       <p>{16} Everybody knows well that the agitation of the Bengalis
   is not the agitation of the whole of India. But suppose it were the
   agitation of the whole of India, and that every nation had taken part
   in it, do you suppose the Government is so weak that it would not
   suppress it, but must needs be itself overwhelmed? Have you not seen
   what took place in the Mutiny? It was a time of great difficulty. The
   army had revolted; some budmashes had joined it; and Government
   wrongly believed that the people at large were taking part in the
   rebellion. I am the man who attacked this wrong notion, and while
   Government was hanging its officials [actually, "while the Government
   officials were hanging people"], I printed a pamphlet ["The
   Causes of the Indian Revolt"], and told Government that it was
   entirely false to suppose that the people at large were rebellious. But
   in spite of all these difficulties, what harm could this rebellion do
   to Government? Before the [reinforcing] English troops had landed she
   had regained her authority from shore to shore. Hence, what benefit is
   expected from all this for the country, and what revolution in the
   Government can we produce? The only results can be to produce a useless
   uproar, to raise suspicions in Government, and to bring back again that
   time which we experienced thirty or thirty-one years ago. This is on
   the supposition that by all of us coming together we could do
   something; but if you take the agitation as it is, what could it
   accomplish? The case of Ireland is held up as an example. I will not
   discuss the question whether that agitation is right or wrong. I will
   only point out that there are at this moment in Ireland thousands of
   men ready to give up their lives at the point of the sword. Men of
   high position who sympathise with that movement fear neither the prison
   nor the bayonets of the police. Will you kindly point out to me ten men
   among our agitators who will consent to stand face to face with the
   bayonets? When this is the case, then what sort of an uproar is this,
   and is it of such a nature that we ought to join it?

       <p>{17} We ought to consider carefully our own circumstances
   and the circumstances of Government. If Government entertains
   unfavourable sentiments towards our community, then I say with the
   utmost force that these sentiments are entirely wrong. At the
   same time if we are just, we must admit that such sentiments would be
   by no means unnatural. I repeat it. If Government entertains these bad
   sentiments, it is a sign of incompetence and folly. But I say this: we
   ought to consider whether Government can entertain such thoughts or
   not. Has she any excuse for such suspicions, or not? I reply that she
   certainly has. Think for a moment who you are. What is this nation of
   ours? We are those who ruled India for six or seven hundred years.
   (Cheers.) From our hands the country was taken by Govemment into its
   own. Is it not natural then for Government to entertain such thoughts?
   Is Government so foolish as to suppose that in seventy years we have
   forgotten all our grandeur and our empire? Although, should Government
   entertain such notions, she is certainly wrong; yet we must remember
   she has ample excuse. We do not live on fish, nor are we afraid of
   using a knife and fork lest we should cut our fingers. (Cheers.) Our
   nation is of the blood of those who made not only Arabia, but Asia and
   Europe, to tremble. It is our nation which conquered with its sword the
   whole of India, although its peoples were all of one religion.
   (Cheers.) I say again that if Government entertains suspicions of us,
   it is wrong. But do her the justice and admit that there is a
   reasonable ground for such suspicions. Can a wise ruler forget what the
   state of things was so short a time ago? He can never forget it. If
   then the Mahomedans also join these monstrous and
   unreasonable schemes, which are impossible of fulfilment, and which are
   disastrous for the country and for our nation, what will be the result?
   If Government be wise and Lord Dufferin be a capable Viceroy, then he
   will realise that a Mahomedan agitation is not the same as a Bengali
   agitation, and he will be bound to apply an adequate remedy. If I were
   Viceroy; and my nation took part in this affair, I would first of all
   drop down on them, and make them feel their mistake.

       <p>{18}Our course of action should be such as to convince
   Government of the wrongness of her suspicions regarding us, if she
   entertain any. We should cultivate mutual affection. What we want, we
   should ask for as friends. And if any ill-will exist, it should be
   cleansed away. I am glad that some Pathans of the N.-W. P. [North-West
   Provinces] and Oudh are here today, and I hope some Hindu Rajputs are
   also present. My friend Yusuf Shah of the Punjab sits here, and he
   knows well the mood of mind of the people of the Punjab, of the Sikhs
   and Musalmans. Suppose that this agitation that has arisen in Bengal
   and I imagine that no danger can spring from it there suppose that this
   agitation extends to these Provinces, to the Rajputsand Pathans of
   Peshawar, do you think it will confine itself to writing with the pen
   giz, giz, giz, giz, giz [the scratching of  a pen] and to mere talking
   buk, buk, buk, buk [babbling]? It will then be necessary for Government
   to send its army and show by bayonets what the proper remedy for this
   agitation is. I believe that when Government sees the Mahomedans
   and other brave races taking part in this stupid agitation, it will be
   necessary for Government to pass a new law and to fill the jails. O my
   brothers! Children of my heart! This is your relationship to
   Government: you should conduct yourself in a straightforward and calm
   manner; not come together to make a noise and a hubbub like a flock of
   crows. (Cheers and laughter.)

       <p>{19}I come now to some other proposals of the Congress. We
   have now a very charming suggestion. These people wish to have the
   Budget of India submitted to them for sanction: "Leave aside political
   expenses; but ask our opinion about the expenses of the army. Why on
   earth has Government made so big an army? Why have you put Governors in
   Bombay and Madras? Pack them off at once!" I too am of the opinion that
   their ideas should certainly be carried out. I only ask them to say
   who, not only of them but of the whole people of India, can tell me
   about the new kinds of cannon which have been invented which is the
   mouth and which the butt end. Can anyone tell me the expense of firing
   a shot? Does anyone understand the condition of the army? One who has
   seen the battlefield, the hail-shower of shots, the falling of the
   brave soldiers one over another, may know what equipments are needed
   for an army. If then under these circumstances, a Mahomedan were on
   this Council, or a Bengali one of that nation which in learning is the
   crown of all Indian nations, which has raised itself by the
   might of learning from a low to a high position how could he give any
   advice? How ridiculous then for those who have never seen a
   battlefield, or even the mouth of a cannon, to want to prepare the
   Budget for the army!

       <p>{20} A still more charming proposal is the following. When
   some people wrote articles in newspapers, showing that it was
   impossible to establish representative government in India, and
   bringing forward cogent reasons, then they came down a little from
   their high flight and said, "Let us sit in the Council, let us chatter;
   but take votes or not, as you please"; can you tell me the meaning of
   this, or the use of this folly?

       <p>{21} Another very laughable idea is this. Stress is laid on
   these suggestions: that the Arms Act be repealed, that Indian
   Volunteers be enlisted, and that army schools be established in India.
   But do you know what nation is proposing them? If such proposals had
   come from Mahomedans or from our Rajput brothers, whose ancestors
   always wore the sword, which although it is taken from their belts yet
   still remains in their hearts if they had made such proposals there
   would have been some sense in it. But what nation makes these demands?
   I agree with them in this, and consider that Government has committed
   two very great mistakes. One is not to trust the Hindustanis and to
   allow them to become volunteers. A second error of Government of the
   greatest magnitude is this: that it does not give appointments in the
   army to those brave people whose ancestors did not use the pen
   to write with; no, but a different kind of pen (cheers) nor did they
   use black ink, but the ink they dipped their pens in was red, red ink
   which flows from the bodies of men. (Cheers.) O brothers! I have
   fought Government in the harshest language about these points. The time
   is, however, coming when my brothers, Pathans, Syeds, Hashimi, and
   Kereishi, whose blood smells of the blood of Abraham, will appear in
   glittering uniform as Colonels and Majors in the army. But we must wait
   for that time. Government will most certainly attend to it; provided
   you do not give rise to suspicions of disloyalty. O brothers!
   Government, too, is under some difficulties as regards this last charge
   I have brought against her. Until she can trust us as she can her white
   soldiers, she cannot do it. But we ought to give proof that whatever we
   were in former days, that time has gone; and that now we are as
   well-disposed to her as the Highlanders of Scotland. And then we should
   claim this from Government.

       <p>{22} I will suppose for a moment that you have conquered a
   part of Europe, and have become its rulers. I ask whether you would
   equally trust the men of that country. This was a mere supposition. I
   come now to a real example. When you conquered India, what did you
   yourself do? For how many centuries was there no Hindu in the army
   list? But when the time of the Moghal family came and mutual trust was
   established, the Hindus were given very high appointments. Think how
   many years old is the British rule. How long ago was the Mutiny?
   And tell me how many years ago Government suffered such grievous
   troubles, though they arose from the ignorant and not from the
   gentlemen? Also call to mind that in the Madras Presidency,
   Government has given permission to the people to enlist as volunteers.
   I say, too, that this concession was premature; but it is a proof that
   when trust is established, Government will have no objection to make
   you also volunteers. And when we shall be qualified, we shall acquire
   those positions with which our forefathers were honoured. Government
   has advanced one step. She has also shown a desire to admit us to the
   civil appointments in the Empire.(Cheers.)

       <p>{23} In the time of Lord Ripon I happened to be a member of
   the Council. Lord Ripon had a very good heart and kind disposition, and
   every qualification for a Governor. But unfortunately his hand was
   weak. His ideas were Radical. At that time the Local Board and
   Municipality Bills were brought forward,and the intention of them was
   that everybody should be appointed by election. Gentlemen, I am not a
   Conservative, I am a great Liberal. But to forget the prosperity of
   one's nation is not a sign of wisdom. The only person who was opposed
   to the system of election was myself. If I am not bragging too much, I
   may, I think, say that it was on account of my speech that Lord Ripon
   changed his opinion and made one-third of the members appointed and
   two-thirds elected. Now just consider the result of election. In
   no town are Hindus and Mahomedans equal. Can the Mahomedans suppress
   the Hindus and become the masters of our "Self-Government"? In
   Calcutta an old, bearded Mahomedan of noble family met me and said that
   a terrible calamity had befallen them. In his town there were eighteen
   elected members, not one of whom was a Mahomedan; all were Hindus. Now
   he wanted Government to appoint some Mahomedan; and he hoped Government
   would appoint himself. This is the state of things in all cities. In
   Aligarh also, were there not a special rule, it would be impossible for
   any Mahomedan, except my friend Maulvi Mahomed Yusuf, to be elected;
   and at last he too would have to rely on being appointed by Government.
   Then how can we walk along a road for which neither we nor the country
   is prepared?

       <p>{24} I am now tired and have no further strength left. I can
   say no more. But in conclusion, I have one thing to say, lest my
   friends should say that I have not told them what is of advantage for
   our nation and for the country; and by what thing we may attain
   prosperity. My age is above seventy. Although I cannot live to see my
   nation attain to such a position as my heart longs for for it, yet my
   friends who are present in this meeting will certainly see the nation
   attain such honour, prosperity and high rank, if they attend to my
   advice. But my friends, do not liken me to that dyer who, only
   possessing mango-coloured dye, said mango-coloured dye was the only one
   he liked. I assure you that the only thing which can raise you to a
   high rank is high education. Until our nation can give birth to a
   highly-educated people, it will remain degraded; it will be below
   others, and will not attain such honour as I desire for it. These
   precepts I have given you from the bottom of my heart. I do not care if
   any one calls me a mad manor anything else. It was my duty to tell
   those things which, in my opinion, are necessary for the welfare of my
   nation, and to cleanse my hands before God the Omnipotent, the
   Merciful, and the Forgiver of sins.

     <p>Three cheers were then given for Sir Syed Ahmed, and three cheers
     for the Chairman, who had presided also throughout the meetings of
     the Mahomedan Educational Congress.
