   <h>KERMIT 95 SUPPORT AND UPDATE STATUS

   <p>All software has bugs. Every time a new version of Kermit 95 is
   released, no matter how thoroughly tested, bug reports arrive after the
   fact. We document Kermit 95 bugs in several places:

   <h>KERMIT 95 BUG LIST.
          <p>Known bugs (most of them fixed, or with workarounds provided)
          at the time ofthe most recent release (HTML).

   <h>KERMIT 95 BUG LIST ADDITIONS AND UPDATES.
          <p>Bugs discovered or reported since the most recent release,
          often with workarounds (plain text).

   <h>KERMIT 95 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS.
          <p>Commonly reported problems are addressed here.

   <p>Kermit 95 was written over a period of years by members of the
   Kermit Project at Columbia University. It is essentially C-Kermit
   with Windows-specific code layered on top (notably the terminal
   emulator and the GUI features) and underneath (Windows file, device,
   and networking interfaces). Due to diminished revenues after the
   economic decline of 2000-2001, Jeffrey Altman, the author of
   the Windows-specific code (as well as of the security code - SSH,
   SSL/TLS, Kerberos, and SRP - and much else) was laid off and now has
   his own company, Secure Endpoints,Inc. All our Windows development
   expertise is now at that company. Jeff continues to work on Kermit 95,
   and has produced numerous fixes and enhancements, listed here:

   <p>Since Jeff is no longer paid by Columbia to do this work, his updates
   are not available from the Kermit Project. If you need any of the
   updates listed in the document just referenced, you can get them
   directly from Jeff under the terms listed here:

    <p>Similarly, those who need new features added or custom modifications
   made to Kermit 95 should contact Jeff directly.

   <p>Kermit 95 support (questions, troubleshooting, etc) is provided by the
   Kermit Project as outlined in the below, except that when a
   problem involves certain facets of the program (such as terminal
   emulation or security) it might be necessary to refer the case to
   Secure Endpoints.

   <p>We do expect to have a new Kermit 95 release incorporating all of
   Jeff's changes - as well as new developments in C-Kermit itself -
   available at some point. The exact timing and terms are yet to be
   determined. Changes to C-Kermit since K952.1.3 (which was based on
   C-Kermit 8.0.206) was released are listed in the following pages:


   <p>The new K95 release, if it comes, will be only for Windows XP
   and later, will be fully checked out on Windows Vista, and will appear
   only in GUI (not Console) form. It will come with a modern MSI
   installer (allowing automated installation and upgrades via Group
   Policy and organization-specific customizations, e.g. packaging of
   custom Dialer entries, initialization files, and scripts). And since we
   won't be supporting Windows 95/98/ME any more, we should be able to put
   the Dialer back to using the convenient notebook tabs for its entries
   rather than the current awkward "direct access" one-at-a-time method.
   We also expect that the next release of Kermit 95 will support large
   files (transfer, access, and management of files bigger than 2GB) and
   64-bit integer arithmetic, andperhaps also a GUI dialog for file
   uploads. More about the next release HERE.
     _________________________________________________________________

   <h>C-KERMIT SUPPORT AND UPDATE STATUS

   <p>C-Kermit is still supported and developed within the Kermit Project
   at Columbia University, except for the security code (SSL/TLS,
   Kerberos,and SRP), which depends on Secure Endpoints, Inc (see previous
   section). The C-Kermit page is HERE.
     _________________________________________________________________

   <h>MS-DOS KERMIT SUPPORT AND UPDATE STATUS

   <p>MS-DOS Kermit is still supported by the Kermit Project at
   Columbia University on a best-effort basis, but is no longer in active
   development. See the MS-DOS Kermit web page for further information.
     _________________________________________________________________

   <h>OTHER KERMIT PROGRAMS

   <p>Other Kermit programs (IBM mainframe, PDP-11, DECSYSTEM-10/20,
   PRIME,Honeywell, CP/M, and so on) are supported on a best-effort
   basis, but are no longer in active development (except sometimes).
     _________________________________________________________________

   <h>HOW TO GET TECHNICAL SUPPORT

   <p>The Kermit project offers technical support in the following ways.
      Manuals. The published manuals and other documentation should
       answer the majority of your questions. Please consult them before
       asking for technical support:
          <p> Kermit 95 users: Please consult the online Kermit 95 manual,
            which you can access from the Help menu of the Dialer or the
            GUI version of K95 itself. Also look at the Kermit 95 Tutorial
            and the Kermit 95 FAQ (FrequentlyAsked Questions) before
            reporting problems; the most commonly reported problems are
            discussed there.

       theKERMIT.BWRandNETWORKS\SETUP.DOCfiles in your KERMIT directory
       before sending questions or reporting problems. If you are having
       problems with MS-DOS Kermit on Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000/XPor OS/2,
       please switch to Kermit 95, which is native to those platforms and
       fully supported (CLICK HERE for details).

     <p>On the Web. Point your Web browser at
   http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/and look through the Kermit FAQ
   (Frequently Asked Questions) and other topic areas.

     <p>By netnews. Read and post questions to
   comp.protocols.kermit.misc.Members of the Kermit team will respond to
   questions on a best-effort basis. Others may also respond. Please don't
   post large messages (e.g. debug or packet logs, long scripts) to the
   newsgroup - use email for that (next item).

     <p>By email to kermit-support@columbia.edu. Members of the Kermit team
   will respond within several days, usually faster.

     <p>Telephone support is available by calling +1 (212) 854-5126(USA, New
   York).
     _________________________________________________________________

   <h>ORGANIZATIONAL SUPPORT

   <p>An organization (university, company, government agency) that provides
   Kermit software to its computer users or clients should also provide
   technical support to them. The organization may appoint a technical
   liaison with the Kermit Project, and we will be glad to supply support
   to that person.

   <p>The organization should not send all of its users to us for
   technical support. This can not possibly work, since (a) we do not
   understand the hardware, software, communications, and networking setup
   of your organization; (b) we do not know what customizations have been
   made to Kermit at your organization, and (c) we do not have the
   resources to help large masses of people one-on-one.

   <p>If you are member of an organization that provided you with Kermit
   software, please obtain support from within your own organization. If
   they can't help you, then have your organization's technical liaison
   contact us. This allows the necessary information to reach your entire
   organization at once, rather than one person at a time. If your
   organization does not have a liaison with us, then they should appoint
   one.
     _________________________________________________________________

   <h>HINTS FOR PREPARING A PROBLEM REPORT

   <p>. . . which might help you solve the problem yourself

   <p>Many people are not aware that there are hundreds of different Kermit
   programs on thousands of different hardware and software platforms,
   operating over all kinds of different connections. Not everybody is
   using the same Kermit software you are, on the same kind of computer,
   or over the same kind of connection. Before we can begin to help you,
   we need the following preliminary information:

    <p> Is your question about Kermit software?
         <l> If it is a question about email or some other application,
            even if you are accessing it through Kermit, then it probably
            is not a question about Kermit software itself. The Kermit
            help desk does not offer help with email programs or other
            non-Kermit applications, except to the extent that we can
            advise you choose the appropriate terminal emulation and help
            you setup the key mappings, if necessary. Otherwise, you will
            need to ask the owners, makers, or vendors of the non-Kermit
            application, or your organization's or ISP's local help desk,
            for help or instruction.
         <l> A lot of third-party software packages include a Kermit
            file-transfer protocol implementation (usually not a very good
            one). If your software is not a Kermit software program from
            the Kermit Project at Columbia University, it is not our
            software and we can't help you with it. Kermit programs all
            have "Kermit" in their names, like MS-DOS Kermit, Kermit
            95,C-Kermit, G-Kermit, Kermit-370, etc. If you are asking
            about the Kermit implementation in somebody else's software,
            you'll need to go to the maker or vendor of that software for
            help or instruction.
         <l> If you have a problem transferring files with Kermit protocol
            between a Kermit Project program and a third-party product,
            we'll support our end of it. If the problem lies with the
            non-Columbia implementation, we'll do our best to provide a
            diagnosis or workaround, but we can not be expected to
            support or sanction improper or buggy Kermit protocol
            implementations in third-party products.
       <p>If there is a problem with the interface between some other
       vendor's software and one of our Kermit programs, have the vendor
       of that software get in touch with us.
    <p> Which Kermit program are you using? (What is its name? How does
       it identify itself when you start it?) The most commonly used
       Kermit programs Kermit 95, C-Kermit, are MS-DOS Kermit, and IBM
       Mainframe Kermit. (If your question concerns Kermit-32 on VMS,
       please note that Kermit-32 has not been supported since 1987; the
       supported Kermit software for VMS is C-Kermit).

          <p>If you are using Kermit 95...
                <p>Please take a look at the Kermit 95 Tutorial if you are
                having trouble getting started. Also the Kermit 95 Read
                Me document for orientation, filelayout, etc. Then,
                before requesting assistance, please visit the Kermit 95
                Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document; your issue
                might already be covered there.

          <p>If you are using C-Kermit...
                <p>Please take a look at the C-Kermit Tutorial if you are
                having trouble getting started. Before requesting
                assistance, please visit the C-Kermit FAQ and see if it
                helps.

       <p>Also see the Kermit FAQ for issues that pertain all Kermit
       programs.
   <p> What is the version number of the Kermit program? (Most
       Kermit programs have a "version" command; if not, the version
       number is announced when Kermit starts). If you are using an old
       version (see list of current versions), we will generally recommend
       that you install the current version and see if the problem still
       occurs. A list of current Kermit software versions can be
       found HERE. If you are using the current version of C-Kermit, we
       might recommend that you download the latest Development Build to
       see if the problem is already fixed (you might want to save time by
       doing this in advance).
     <p>If it is Kermit 95 2.0 or later, are you using the GUI version
       or Console version? This information is especially important if
       your report concerns screen appearance, character sets, fonts, etc.
       At this point, everybody should be using the version 2.1.3 of K95
       in its GUI form. There is no reason to use the Console version
       (which suffers from countless bugs and restrictions in
       Windows console application support) unless you really know what
       you are doing.
    <p> Do you have the manual for your version of Kermit? Have you
       consulted it?
    <p> If it is C-Kermit or G-Kermit, did you build it from source
       code, or are you using one of the prebuilt binaries? If you are
       using a prebuilt binary, which one? Are you sure it is the
       appropriate one for your computer?(To overcome such problems as
       library version mismatches, you might want to download and build
       from source.) If you built C-Kermit from source code,which
       make file target did you use?
    <p> On what kind of computer is your Kermit program running?
    <p> What operating system and version is used on this computer? If your
       computer has Windows 95 or later but you are trying to use
       MS-DOS Kermit on it, please note that this combination is not
       supported; CLICK HERE for details.
    <p> What kind of connection are you using (or are you trying to
       make)? Direct serial, dialup, Telnet, SSH, Rlogin, X.25, ...? If it
       is a modem connection:
        <p> Which communication device are you using? Some operating
            systems have a selection of drivers for the same device, which
            are selected by using different names for the device; see, for
            example, the discussion of serial port names in HP-UX in
            the Unix C-Kermit "beware file".

     <p>If you are using Kermit 95, you should be aware that it has
     two methods for accessing serial ports and modems; the traditional,
     built-in "DOS" method ("set port com1, set modem type us robotics,
     ...") and the Windows-specific Control Panel interface ("set port
     tapi"). If one doesn't work, try the other. See the K95 FAQ formore
     about this.
         <l> What kind of modem are you using? Is it internal or external?
            If you have a PC with an internal modem, is it a real modem or
            a "Winmodem"? If you think it might be a Winmodem, CLICK HERE.
         <l> What kind of modem does Kermit think you are using? In
            other words, has Kermit been informed appropriately as to your
            modem type?
         <l> What are the serial port communications parameters: speed,
            parity, flow control? In most Kermit programs, these are
            listed by the SHOWCOMMUNICATIONS command.
         <l> What kind of modem is on the other end? What is the remote
            modem connected to? - A serial port on the computer, a
            terminal server?
         <l> What other communications equipment is involved? - An
            X.25PAD? A 3270 protocol converter? A terminal server? An
            intermediate computer? etc etc...

     <p>A serial connection (direct or dialup) must have an effective form
     off low control at every junction between computer (or terminal
     server, etc) and modem. This means that each pair of devices that
     are connected must be using the same kind of flow control, usually
     either RTS/CTS (hardware)or Xon/Xoff (software). If this is not
     true, there can be any amount of data loss or corruption on the
     connection.
         <p> If your complaint is that you see garbage when the connection
            is made... please describe the garbage: is it 100% garbage?Or
            is some of the text recognizable?
               <l> If approximately 50% of the characters are wrong, you
                 probably need to tell Kermit to "set parity even" (or
                 other parity choice)
               <l> If all of the characters are wrong, there is almost
                 certainly a speed mismatch between (a) Kermit and your
                 modem, or (b) the answering modem's serial port and the
                 serial port of the computer or device it is connected to.
         <p> How did you make the connection? - Did you use Kermit's
            built-in DIAL command? If not, please try it ("help dial" for
            more information). The DIAL command automatically does what it
            can to synchronize serial-port speed, flow control, and other
            critical parameters between your computer and the dialing
            modem.
       <p>If it is a direct serial connection:
         <l> Are you sure you have the appropriate kind of cable (e.g.
            null-modem instead of modem)? CLICK HERE for more
            information about cables.
         <l> Have you correctly identified the communication port to
            Kermit (e.g. COM1 or COM2 or a TAPI device name in K95;
            /dev/ttyS0 or somesuchin Linux/Unix, etc)? (SET PORT or SET
            LINE).
        <l> Is the speed ("baud") the same on both ends? For example, if
            the speed is 9600 bps ("baud") on the far end, then Kermit's
            speed must also be set to 9600 (SET SPEED). A typical symptom
            of a speed mismatch is that you see characters on your screen
            but they are total nonsense.
         <l> If the computer on the far end uses "parity", you have to set
            Kermit's parity to match: SET PARITY EVEN, ODD, or MARK. A
            typical symptom of a parity mismatch is that some characters
            are intelligible, some are not.
         <l> If the terminal screen is completely frozen, you might have
            a flow-control deadlock, often caused by an incorrectly or
            incompletely wired cable or by transmission noise. Tell Kermit
            to SET FLOW NONE, and if that unsticks the screen, then you
            can come back later and fix the real problem.
   <p> What kind of computer or device or service is on the other end
       of the connection?

     <p>Is the device, host, or service text based? Is it a PPP server? Do
     you have to log in to it? Do you get a login prompt? Do you get a
     menu? Are you immediately connected to a Kermit server?
   <p> What operating system and version does that computer use?
   <p> If you are reporting a file-transfer problem: what Kermit
       program and version is on the other computer? Does the transfer
       fail at the very beginning (constant retrying of the first packet),
       or partway through? Does it happen the same way every time? NOTE:
       Most current releases of Kermit software do not support transfer of
       files larger than 2GB; forthcoming releases will do so on
       selected platforms.
   <p> If you are reporting a terminal emulation problem: What kind
       terminal is your local Kermit program emulating, and what kind of
       terminal does the host computer think you have? If you are using
       C-Kermit, seethe C-Kermit FAQ. If you are having problems with F
       keys, Arrow keys, the Numeric keypad,or the Backspace key, consult
       the appropriate items in the Kermit FAQ:
          <l> Backspace key
          <l> Arrow keys
          <l> F keys
          <l> Numeric keypad
   <p> What is the exact nature of the problem? Is it a failure to makea
       connection? A failure to transfer files? A problem with terminal
       emulation? Exactly what happens, compared to what you think should
       happen?
   <p> What commands did you give? Is the problem reproducible?

   <p>If you are using email to follow up on a previous or ongoing matter,
   please include relevant portions of previous correspondence. If you
   want to send Kermit scripts for us to look at as attachments or
   enclosures, please give them a name that ends with .txt, not (say).ini
   or .scr or .ksc. Virus scanners will remove them. Anyway, since Kermit
   scripts and logs are plain text, you can just include them directly in
   your message, there is no need to structure them as attachments.

   <p>Data communication is rarely as simple as we'd like it to be. From
   the very basic set of questions above, you can see that there are at
   least three, and perhaps as many as eight (or more) completely separate
   hardware and software components to your connection, all of which must
   be configured to interoperate with each other and to pass the desired
   data through.

   <p>This is why communications software can be harder to use than
   self-contained applications that stay inside your computer, where
   (hopefully) all quantities are known. Also note that when you are using
   Kermit to make a serial connection, you are performing the job of a
   network specialist- making a connection that did not exist before,
   probably using a variety of equipment and software from different
   makers. Network specialists need years of training before they can do
   this - don't expect it to be effortless, although sometimes it might
   be. Every case is different. (Network connections are usually easier,
   because network specialists have already set up the network for you.)

   <p>Kermit manuals are generally 400-700 pages long. A great many of these
   pages are devoted to the many and varied communication methods, and
   what that can go wrong on each one, and methods for diagnosis and
   repair of problems. Please use the manuals. If you have suggestions for
   making them better, send them to us.

   <p>Thank you for helping us to serve you better!
