                                                               <p> Chronicle

   <p>WILLIMANTIC- Despite running a supportive-housing apartment complex
   with 652 tenants in Times Square since 1994, Common Ground is still
   known by neighbors as the "ice cream people."

   <p>And ice cream, specifically Ben & Jerry's, was on the minds of some
   locals who attended a community meeting Wednesday night to learn more
   about the Manhattan-based developer's plans for the Seth Chauncey
   (Hooker) Hotel and the Nathan Hale on Main Street.

   <p>Rosanne Haggerty, founder and president of Common Ground, said she
   would approach Ben & Jerry's, which has opened "partnershops" at three
   Common Ground locations in Manhattan.

   <p>Haggerty added no meetings have taken place yet.

   <p>She also said Common Ground has worked not only with businesses like
   Ben & Jerry's and Starbucks, but locally owned businesses as well.

   <p>Ice cream aside, the community meeting marked the official unveiling
   of Common Ground's $16 million plans to rehab the two Main Street
   properties into a mix of first floor retail, with an estimated 100
   units of housing for people with special needs, such as the homeless
   and low-income working poor.

   <p>The Hale was previously and Eastern Connecticut State University
   property, but was relinquished to the state early this year.

   <p>The hotel is owned by Robert Riquier, but is currently under the
   management of court appointed reciever, Albert Bleau.

   <p>Haggerty outlined Common Ground's previous successes, which include
   the Times Square.

   <p>Previously a flop house that fell into disrepair, the Times Square is
   a cleaned-up version of its former self. Where beat cops stop for
   coffee, not for overdoses, she said.

   <p>The same model will be used in Willimantic, she said, including
   accountable, on-site management, 24-hour security, on-site social
   services and community involvement.

   <p>Residents brought up a wide array of concerns from parking, to taxes,
   to economic development, to whether the housing will really address
   the needs of the homeles.

   <p>Heather Meehan, a local real estate developer with an office on Main
   Street, questioned Common Ground's plans for parking. "We really don't
   think 15 spaces is going to be suitable," she said.

   <p>The solution to the potential parking crunch, Haggerty said, will be
   reliance on a larger parking plan being developed by town officials.

   <p>She also said a study of similar supportive housing sites in the state
   showed there wouldn't be a large demand for parking by tenants.

   <p>While Selectman Tom White said he supported the project he emphasized
   the need for the project to pay tax dollars.

   <p>Haggerty said Common Ground will pay at least the amount of taxes
   currently owed at the hotel-which are roughly $17,000 per year.

   <p>White said he hoped more taxes would be paid for the Nathan Hale,
   because the town only recieved 30 cents for every dollar of taxes owed
   for the state-owned property.

   <p>"We basically need dollar for dollar," he said. "We're a poor town, we
   cant just keep giving abatements out."

   <p>Tom McNally, case manager at the covent Soup Kitchen, said the hotel
   in its former incarnation "did serve a purpose" by providing emergency
   housing.

   <p>"How long will it take to get a person in there, if we can even get a
   person in there?" he asked Haggerty, adding Common Ground's plan might
   actually increase homelessness.

   <p>Haggerty agreen the planned housing model cannot "solve every need,"
   but will help improve living conditions and the perception of Main
   Street.

   <p>Common Ground plans to cap income for residents at $24,100, or 50
   percent of the area's median income.

   <p>Half of the tenants will be "special needs" while the other half will
   be culled from the local, low-income workforce.

   <p>The connecticut Housing Finance Authority-which took over an option to
   buy both the hotel and the old YMCA across the street from the Savings
   Institute-hopes to close on the purchase of the properties by the end
   of April, according to Bruce H. Perry, vice president for the agency's
   multifamily branch.

   <p>Once the properties are aquired, Common Ground will be named property
   manager of the hotel, but not the YMCA.

   <p>Footing the bill for the project, according to Haggerty, will be the
   CHFA's supportive housing pilots initiative, along with low- and
   historic-housing tax credits and private financing.

   <p>Current tenants at the hotel will be accomodated, including couples.
   However, the focus, Haggerty said, will be providing housing for
   single tenants.

   <p>The next community meeting planned by Common Ground is scheduled for
   April 29 and will focus on the economic impact of the hotel on
   downtown.

   <p>More information on Common Ground and its plans for Willimantic can be
   found at www.commonground.org/replication.

   <p>Haggerty also urged residents to take a trip down to New York City to
   tour some of the organizations buildings.

   <p>Tours can be arranged through Catherine San Fan Andre. She can be
