<h>Long Distance Phone Service



   <p>At one point, reviews said, telecom giants AT&T, MCI and Sprint were
   the best choices for long distance service but this is no longer true,
   partly because call quality and service are uniformly good across all
   vendors. Meanwhile, the cheaper no-name companies buy their long
   distance service wholesale from the telecom giants, so the quality of
   service is generally the same no matter what. Fueling the competitive
   market are cell phone companies, most of which lure consumers away
   from traditional long-distance services with free evening and weekend
   minutes.

   <p>Conventional long-distance providers are staying competitive with cell
   rates, offering single-rate 24/7 plans, so calls to out-of-state
   relatives no longer need to be delayed in order to snag lower
   nighttime or weekend rates. In our research, we found long-distance
   rates as low as 2.5¢ per minute. And surprisingly, we discovered the
   big three are offering competitive rates in bundled packages. A
   bundled package is a flat rate fee for unlimited local, in-state and
   long-distance calls. This type of plan, however, is only beneficial if
   you make a high number of calls.

<h>Per-minute plans offer cheap long distance

   <p>If you make less than 12 hours of long-distance calls per month, then
   a per-minute plan is probably your best bet. Of course, you'll need to
   do a little math and figure in your local service in order to decide
   whether you'd do better with an all-inclusive long-distance plan like
   AT&T's Unlimited Plus (*est. $29.95 per month). But if you don't make
   that many long distance calls, a per-minute plan will most likely be
   your cheapest option. Three companies came up repeatedly in our
   research: ECG, Pioneer and CogniState. Newcomer 3U Telecom has the
   best international long-distance rates.


                                    
   <p>SaveOnPhone.com and Tollchaser.com say that right now, ECG (Enhanced
   Communications Group) has the best deal. Long-distance rates with ECG
   Easy 2.5 run 2.5¢ per minute state-to-state with a minimum 59¢ monthly
   charge. The minimum per-call charge is six seconds and after that,
   calls are charged in 18-second increments. While this isn't the
   absolute lowest billing increment we found (some companies bill in
   six-second increments; 3U bills in one-second intervals), competing
   companies such as OPEX and PNG charge by the minute. Customer service
   appears to be a factor in many of the reviews we read, and ECG excels
   in this respect as well. Editors at SaveOnPhone say customer-service
   response time was less than one minute.

   <p>With ECG's Easy 2.5¢ plan, you must pay your pay automatically with a
   credit or debit card. A paper bill or check payment isn't an option.
   ECG has another plan, the Basic 3.5 plan, which charges 3.5¢ per
   minute with a $2.50 monthly minimum. The only advantage to this plan
   is that you get a monthly bill in the mail, which you can review
   before you pay. Still, if you prefer receiving a monthly paper bill,
   ECG has one of the better deals. These plan won't be available to
   customers in about 15% of the U.S., depending on your local service
   carrier. You can determine whether you are eligible for ECG by
   punching in your phone number on their Web site (https://dialecg.com).
   Note that calls to Hawaii and Alaska cost more (18.7¢ per minute for
   Alaska and 21.4¢ for Hawaii). Higher-cost calls to these states are
   typical of discount long-distance services.

   <p>CogniState and CogniWorld are both listed in the top five in many of
   the reviews we read. CogniState, which boasts great in-state rates,
   also has a long distance plan which includes a competitive 3.45¢ per
   minute rate with no monthly minimum and no monthly service charge,
   along with six-second billing increments. Online billing is free, but
   if you prefer a paper bill, CogniState tacks on a $2 monthly fee if
   your bill is under $20. If your bill is over $20, the paper-bill
   charge is waived. In our research, we found this policy to be fairly
   typical of discount long-distance companies.

   <p>William Van Hefner, editor of The Digest, reviews the CogniState 3.45¢
   per minute plan and highly recommends it. He also points out the low
   rates only apply to those whose phone service is provided by a
   regional Bell company such as SBC, BellSouth, and most of Verizon.
   Customers outside of these service areas will pay a higher rate. But
   if your area is served by these companies, then you also qualify for
   the cheaper ECG plan.

   <p>Known for their International rates, CogniWorld charges 3.9¢ per
   minute in the 48 continental United States, and offers low
   international rates such as 4.3¢ per minute to Moscow and 5.5¢ to
   Italy. Like CogniState, CogniWorld charges by six-second increments
   and has a minimum six-second call time. There are no monthly fees, but
   there is the same $2 fee if your bill is under $20 and you want your
   bill by mail. Rates for calls to Hawaii (9¢ per minute), and to Alaska
   (12¢ per minute), are better than most, but not as great as 3U's 4.8¢
   per minute cost to either state.

   <p>3U is a new company mentioned in two reviews we found, and it
   undercuts other providers when it comes to international calls and
   calls to Alaska and Hawaii, even though its 4.8¢ per minute domestic
   rate is higher than ECG and CogniState/CogniWorld. 3U charges in
   one-second billing increments, an industry first. That means that if
   your call lasts three seconds, you pay for three seconds. With other
   plans, you'd pay for a six-second call or even a 60-second call. There
   is no monthly fee, and no minimum usage charge. Billing is online or
   by e-mail, and you must pay with an automatic credit or debit card
   deduction. You'll have about three days to review your bill before
   your card is charged. You may choose to receive a paper bill, but 3U
   charges $1 for paper.

   <p>One of 3U's most unique features is its cheap international calling
   rates. Many countries (including Australia, Japan, Germany and the
   U.K.) cost the same 4.8¢ per minute as domestic calls (when calling a
   landline). 3U also gives you a special access number so you can get
   those same rates when calling from your cell phone (as long as your
   cell phone is registered in the 48 continental states). Your cell
   company will simply think you are making a domestic call. If you're
   calling an international cell phone, rates vary a lot, but are still
   lower than other companies. Complete rate info is easy to find on the
   3U Web site (http://www.3Utelecom.com). 3U is available to anyone;
   your local carrier does not have to be a Baby Bell (as it does with
   ECG), so 3U is a good choice for those who can't get ECG.

   <p>Total Call International is not mentioned very often among the least
   expensive calling-plans, but this company has the advantage a wider
   availability than ECG or CogniState. Total Call has a 3.9¢ per minute,
   24/7 rate plan with no minimums or monthly fees, and six-second
   billing increments. You get a regular paper bill in the mail. Total
   Call's customer service is unique in that you can request a
   Spanish-speaking representative, in addition to five other languages.
   Although it is more expensive than ECG, Total Call is available with
   most carriers, and is a good choice if you don't live in ECG's
   coverage area and don't make many international calls (3U is cheaper
   for international calls).

   <p>Pioneer is another company we saw mentioned frequently in reviews of
   long-distance services. Pioneer's per-minute rate is cheaper than
   anyone else: 2.7¢ per minute for domestic calls (excluding Hawaii and
   Alaska). This company also has a good reputation for customer service.
   Billing, however, is in 60-second increments, so if you make a
   10-second call, you are billed for 60 seconds. Like ECG, your current
   location must be served by a baby Bell company, so about 15% of the
   country won't be able to access Pioneer. Paper bills cost $1. There
   appears to be little difference between ECG and Pioneer, but we like
   ECG's shorter billing increments. If you make a lot of intrastate
   calls, it pays to check the rates of both carriers.

   <p>We also saw several plans that offer some kind of incentive for luring
   your friends and relatives to join up. AmeriCom offers an incentive of
   3.5¢ per minute for referring three friends plus a bonus of 1% of your
   friends' usage, but if you are always nagging your friends to switch
   phone providers, you might find yourself with fewer friends to call.
   Several providers offer incentive minutes. PNG (Power Net Global)
   entices new customers with 100 free minutes. The catch is that these
   minutes are distributed after four months, and you can only use 25
   free minutes per month. If you fail to use up your free minutes, you
   lose them.

   <p>Big Red Wire is also available in all but fifteen states (excluded
   states are AK, AZ, CO, IA, ID, ND, MN, OR, MT, NE, NM, SD, UT, WA and
   WY). There's no monthly charge, and rates are 2.6¢ per minute. Big Red
   Wire offers only e-mail customer service and automatic credit/debit
   card billing. If you know anyone else using BRW, this company will
   give you $5 worth of free calls per month, but only to other users of
   Big Red Wire.

<h>Free Long Distance

   <p>Keep in mind that you can also make free Internet calls through
   software applications you can download for free. The catch is that you
   can only call people who also have the same installed application. One
   popular service is Skype (http://www.skype.com), which gets great
   reviews. You can call anyone else who has installed the software over
   your Internet connection at no charge. Skype also has add-on plans
   that let you call regular phones through your computer for about 2¢
   per minute in the U.S., Canada, most of Europe and Australia.

   <p>We have a separate report on VoIP, which includes software such as
   Skype that lets you make free long-distance calls through your
   computer.

<h>Important Features: Long-distance phone service

   <p>Here's what the experts say to look for when choosing a long distance
   carrier:
     <l> Check the fine print for a monthly fee or minimum usage charge.
       For most callers, a monthly fee is a completely unnecessary
       expense. Since long distance rates decrease as competition grows,
       some companies add a monthly fee to offset these lower charges.
       Most companies call this charge a 'recovery fee.' The only
       federally mandated charge is federal tax. The USF (Universal
       Service Fund) charge is required of long-distance companies, but
       the company is under no obligation to pass the fee to consumers
       (most do anyway). Anything additional charges on your bill (other
       than calls) are assessed by the long-distance company, no matter
       what phrasing they use.

     <l> Time increments can have a big impact on your bill. Some companies
       (like AT&T) bill in one-minute increments; if your call lasts one
       minute and one second, you're charged for two minutes. This unused
       time can add up, especially if you make many short long distance
       calls. Programs that bill at six-second increments more accurately
       reflect your actual calling time. Editors of Phonedog.com say the
       savings are 12% to 14% when using a six-second billing increment
       versus a full minute plan.

     <l> Inbound toll-free service is a nice option. This can be a great
       way to avoid accepting charges for collect calls. Many long
       distance providers now offer residential 1-800 numbers, usually
       with the same rates as outbound long distance calling. There's
       usually a monthly charge of about $3 for this service and many
       services, such as ECG and 3U, offer it for free.

   <p>The USF (Universal Service Fund) is a required fee from the FCC
   (Federal Communications Commission) used to help supplement phone
   service for low-income families, schools, roads, libraries and health
   care. Phone-service providers are under no obligation to pass the fee
   to consumers, but most do anyway. In the past, companies used this as
   a license to charge pretty much whatever fees they liked, attributing
   them to USF and pocketing the difference. That has changed. The FCC
   now mandates that all companies charge the same fixed amount, which is
   announced and changed quarterly, and pay the full amount to the FCC.
   The current USF fee can be found on the FCC Web site (www.fcc.gov).

   <p>Bear in mind that this report has no relevance to intrastate calls. If
   a considerable amount of the charges on your monthly bill comes from
   long distance calls made within your state (i.e., from Los Angeles to
   San Francisco), you'll have to do some of your own research to find
   the best rates, since intrastate rates vary so greatly from state to
   state and between carriers it's impossible to make recommendations for
   the general consumer. SaveOnPhone.com is a good resource for checking
   the intrastate rates of various long distance providers.

   <p>All The Reviews Reviewed chart. The Consensus Report appears also in
   the Full Story.


   <p>ECG, with eight recommendations, is included in our Fast Answers as
   the best domestic cent/minute provider. Total Call is also listed in
   our Fast Answers, even though it's more expensive than ECG, they serve
   most of the U.S. CogniState, CogniWorld, and Unitel aren't far behind
   ECG with their low rates and no monthly fees. But most of these
   companies cost more than ECG's 2.5¢ plan, and are not included in Fast
   Answers. Pioneer comes close, with a 2.7¢ plan, but Pioneer charges in
   60-second increments. 3U is a new company with some terrific
   international, Hawaii and Alaska rates.

   Alternative Considerations

<h>10-10 Long Distance

   <p>Before the emergence of so many low-cost direct-dial plans, 10-10 long
   distance providers were the cheapest way to make a long distance phone
   call. These require you to first call an access number before placing
   your call.10-10-834's 3-cents/minute rate is low, but every call has a
   39¢ connection fee. So, even if you get an answering machine, your
   call costs 39¢.

   <p>10-15-335 has a 3.9¢ per-minute rate for the first ten minutes, and
   then the rate increases to 4.9¢ per minute. The catch is that there is
   a ten-minute minimum per call. 10-10 long distance plans are not the
   great deal they once were.

<h>Unlimited long distance Flat-rate long distance

   <p>If you make more than fifteen hours or so of long-distance calls, a
   flat rate plan may be worth investigating. AT&Ts Unlimited Plus plan
   includes "all you can talk" local calls, plus in state and
   state-to-state long distance for $29.95. AT&T charges a monthly
   connection fee in 23 states to recoup charges from some local phone
   companies. The fee varies, but is generally between $1.25 and $1.75.
   You can find out if your state is included by consulting the AT&T Web
   site. AT&T's Unlimited Plus plan does not include local service, and
   you need to have AT&T local service to qualify for the plan. AT&T's
   all-inclusive local and long distance plans start at $58.

   <p>SaveOnPhone.com recommends an MCI plan - The Neighborhood bundle plan
   - for users who spend over $60 on local and long distance service.
   Prices for unlimited calling start at $49.99 (and as low as $39.99 in
   California). The Neighborhood supplies customers with caller ID, call
   waiting, speed dial, voicemail, three-way calling and DSL options.

   <p>In comparison, a bundled package from Cognigen, $29.99 ZeroCents, for
   first time customers, has no setup fee, disconnection fee or
   regulatory assessment fee. Therefore, you'll save a couple dollars
   over AT&T, but only if you're a first time user.

   <p>VoIP plans include both local and long distance calls, along with lots
   of extras like voicemail and call waiting. Starting at about $25 per
   month, most VoIP services are cheaper than traditional bundled
   local/long distance plans. See our report on VoIP for more.
