<h>CDT's 'Balanced Framework' for Copyright Completely Unbalanced 

   <p>The Center for Democracy and Technology has released a report today
   arguing on behalf of a balanced approach to copyright enforcement, a
   carrot and stick (CDT Proposes Balanced Framework for Online Copyright
   Protection). via Constitutional Code, which has many worthwhile
   comments

   <p>Read the 14-page report: Protecting Copyright and Internet Values: A
   Balanced Path Forward: Version 1.0 Spring 2005 [PDF].

   <p>Note: I've long favored the carrot and stick approach. See this
   interview with GrepLaw in September, 2003 (Ernest Miller on DRM,
   Privacy and Hemingway). (You know, I think my answers stand up to the
   test of time pretty well.)

   <p>However, I think the CDT report favors the stick a bit much, treats
   citizen/creators as mere consumers, doesn't consider structural reform
   of copyright law, and doesn't provide much in the way of a carrot,
   among other flaws.

   <p>Read on for a more detailed take on the report...

<h>Senate Judiciary IP Subcommitee Hearing On Int'l Copyright Infringement

   <p>Well, I listened to the nearly two hours of generally dull testimony
   for today's Senate hearing on intellectual property (Notice of
   Subcommitee Hearing: Piracy of Intellectual Property). I suffered so
   that you didn't have to.

   <p>The hearing was chaired by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), who heads the
   Intellectual Property Subcommitee of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) also attended most of the hearing.

   <p>The focus of the meeting was on international copyright infringement,
   particularly in China and Russia. Flash! There is lots of infringement
   in these two countries and something must be done about it, such as
   keeping Russia out of the WTO. And we're really going to get upset
   with China pretty darn soon. Any minute now, in fact. Just you wait,
   we'll do something major to China, you'll see.

<h>C|Net on Possible Judicial Inducement Test

   <p>C|Net News' John Borland has a brief article on the possibility that
   the Supreme Court may craft some sort of inducement test in the
   Grokster case (Supreme Court mulls file-swap 'pushers').
   Unfortunately, the article doesn't really provide any context as to
   the distinctions between the IEEE's active inducement test and the
   RIAA's presumptive inducement test.

<h>Slate Induces Copyright Violations

   <p>Slate has published another good article by tech journalist Paul
   Boutin, who advocates HTML annotation software for bloggers
   (Newsmashing: The new technique that will change blogging forever).
   Basically, you would be able to copy a webpage, then annotate directly
   on top of it, highlighting passages, writing notes, adding links, etc.
   Such is possible today, of course, but a software package that made it
   easy (just as blogging tools made publishing easy), could be a
   significant change, allowing anyone who can blog to create such
   annotations.

   <p>Being a long time fan of annotation, I think this would be great.

   <p>Of course, there is the little issue of copyright violation.
   Certainly, if I hosted the complete original work with annotations,
   that could very clearly lead to a copyright claim. Under the INDUCE
   Act theories, the company that made the software to allow this would
   also be liable. After all, if you are authorized to annotate, then you
   can manipulate the underlying file without need for annotation
   software. Clearly, the intent and purpose of annotation software would
   be to encourage the creation of derivative works and reproductions
   that people are unauthorized to make.

   <p>One possible solution would be to be able to create the annotations as
   a separate file and then layer them over the original copyrighted
   work. If one wanted to see the annotation, they would click a special
   browser link that would go to the original HTML of the work that is
   annotated (no copyright violation there) and then display the
   annotation over it (potential copyright violation). There is a
   drawback in that the underlying work could easily be changed to throw
   off the annotation, but that is a problem with linking in general.

   <p>Of course, all the people who were upset with Google for changing the
   presentation of their work would be just as upset with all the
   annotators. Would this be a copyright violation? Would a software
   company that provided this service be guilty of inducing infringement?

   <p>Currently, it is unclear how such a case would come out. I would like
   to think that annotation of this sort is clearly not a copyright
   violation inherently, but my views are not necessary shared by
   copyright owners and the courts.

   <p>UPDATE 1410 PT

   <p>Apparently Paul Boutin wanted to have an actual newsmashing contest,
   but lawyers shut him down! (Newsmashing!):

     <p>We were going to have a newsmashing contest, but the lawyers shot
     it down. Damn you, copyright law!

   <p>Heh.
   

<h>Final INDUCE Act (IICA) Draft From Copyright Interests - INDUCE Dead for Now

   <p>It would appear that the Inducing Infringement of Copyrights Act of
   2004 is dead. Newsday runs an AP wirestory on the death of INDUCE
   (Senate Talks Fail on File-Sharing Software). via Copyfight

   <p>For the record, according to an anonymous source, this draft version
   of the INDUCE Act from the copyright industries is the one that
   finally convinced consumer and technology groups that compromise
   wouldn't be reached: INDUCE Act - Copyright Owners' Tentative Proposal
   - 05 Oct 2004 [PDF]

   <p>This draft is most similar to the one pointed to by Ed Felton here:
   Recent Induce Act Draft.

   <p>Of course, we should all be wary of the mischief Congress accomplishes
   during lame duck sessions, as well as a revived INDUCE Act next term.

   <p>Might I suggest that the copyright industries spend more time and
   money developing new business plans rather than legislation-drafting
   lawyers?


<h>No INDUCE Act (IICA) Markup Tomorrow? 

   <p>Good news.

   <p>A source familiar with the ongoing Inducing Infringement of Copyrights
   Act (IICA aka INDUCE Act) drafting process informs me that the
   Judiciary Committee will not markup the INDUCE Act tomorrow,
   ostensibly in order to deal with homeland security issues.

   <p>Of course, if true, this is only a postponement. Expect the INDUCE Act
   to rear its ugly head once again, either during the lame duck session
   or next term.

<h>Sen. Hatch Pushing INDUCE Act (IICA) Forward Despite No Consensus? Plus, CDT
Speaks Out 

   <p>It is looking more and more likely that Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) is
   going to try to get something passed tomorrow despite heavy opposition
   from technology and consumer groups.

   <p>Will the Judiciary Committee cravenly accept such an attack on
   innovation and the future, or will they reject Hollywood's efforts to
   determine how the internet will develop?

   <p>The Center for Democracy and Technology has also sent a letter asking
   the Senate to not be foolish: CDT, Letter to Sen. Hatch and Leahy, RE:
   S. 2560, Inducing Infringement of Copyrights Act of 2004, 06 Oct 2004
   [PDF]

     <p>We understand that S.2560 is still scheduled for markup by the
     Judiciary Committee this week. Despite the progress being made,
     current drafts would chill the development of legitimate consumer
     technologies, and we urge you not to pass S.2560 out of Committee
     at this time.
     <p>CDT remains committed to working with you and with the Committee to
     craft a bill narrowly targeted at bad behavior by a small set of
     actors. In the meantime, however, we urge you not to move forward
     with S.2560 because of the real risks it presents to communication
     and innovation on the Internet.

 
<h>Technology and Consumer Groups Oppose INDUCE Act (IICA) Markup

   <p>As I noted earlier, the Inducing Infringement of Copyrights Act (IICA
   aka INDUCE Act) negotations have failed (Secret INDUCE Act (IICA)
   Negotiations Fail!). Now, two letters have been sent to the Senate
   asking that there be no markup as there was no consenus. Hopefully,
   the Senate will recognize that marking up a seriously flawed bill is
   quite a bit worse than utterly foolish.

   <p>From a coalition of consumer groups, including American Library
   Association, EFF, and Public Knowledge: American Association of Law
   Libraries, et. al., Letter to Sen. Hatch and Leahy, RE: S. 2560,
   Inducing Infringement of Copyrights Act of 2004, 06 Oct 2004 [PDF]

     <p>Moreover, every one of the half-dozen drafts proposed would make
     fundamental changes to copyright law, with potentially enormous
     impact on the innovation, creativity, and competition. At this
     point, we are very concerned that staff may present at tomorrows
     executive business meeting complex legislation: 1) on which there
     is no consensus; 2) that would do great harm to future
     technological innovation; and 3) that would not meet the goals that
     you and Senator Leahy have set out.

     <p>Every major change to the Copyright Act in the last century has
     taken several years to draft and fine tune before it was passed.
     Even the controversial Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)
     resulted from numerous hearings and conference reports over a
     three-year period. Given the short period over which S. 2560 has
     been discussed, the absence of hearings on the new language, and
     the overall lack of opportunity for the public to comment, we
     believe it would be in the best interests of all parties to allow a
     more orderly process to go forward, and to have a hearing with
     expert testimony on whatever draft results from this process. We
     can see no other way to achieve true consensus and ensure that the
     public interest and future technological innovations are protected.
     We hope you will agree.

   <p>Technology groups have also sent a letter, including Consumer
   Electronics Association, IEEE-USA, and NetCoalition: Consumer
   Electronics Assoc., Letter to Sen. Hatch and Leahy, RE: S. 2560,
   Inducing Infringement of Copyrights Act of 2004, 06 Oct 2004 [PDF]

     <p>At the July 22 hearing, we committed to working with you to craft a
     legislative alternative to S. 2560. At Chairman Hatch's direction,
     we have been working virtually around the clock for almost a week
     in an effort to reach consensus with the copyright community.
     Notwithstanding everyone's hard work and good intentions, we find
     ourselves farther apart now than at the outset of this process.
     Because we are attempting to write legislation dealing with complex
     and evolving technology, this has proven to be an exceptionally
     difficult process.

     <p>Unfortunately, the recording industry continues to propose language
     that would not solve the piracy problems in the manner you
     identified, but instead would effectively put at risk all consumer
     electronics, information technology products, and Internet products
     and services that aren't designed to the industry's liking. In
     fact, the most recent draft put forward by the recording industry
     at 1:00 am this morning is a large step backwards from previous
     drafts in that it would jeopardize more legitimate products and
     would create a flood of litigation, and thus would hurt vital
     sectors of the U.S. economy. In short, the draft is unacceptable.

   <p>Hopefully, the Senate will take these group's advice and forget about
   INDUCE for now.
   
Secret INDUCE Act (IICA) Negotiations Fail! 

   <p>Reports are that no final compromise was reached on the Inducing
   Infringement of Copyrights Act (IICA aka INDUCE Act). Apparently,
   negotiations broke down on codifying the Betamax decision as well as
   copyright holders arguing for broader language.

   <p>Whether this means that Sen. Orrin Hatch (R - UT) will produce a bill
   for markup tomorrow is anyone's guess. I'm guessing yes. Why should a
   little thing like an unbalanced, dangerous bill stop him?
   
   <p>October 04, 2004

<h>Rumors Continue to Fly Around New INDUCE Act (IICA) Draft 

   <p>According to anonymous reports, our betters continue to develop
   internet innovation policy behind closed doors. Apparently, the open
   transparent processes that led to the development of the internet are
   not appropriate to the development of innovation policy.

   <p>Supposedly, the revised bill will be completed by close of business
   today for markup in the Senate tomorrow. No hearings. No public
   debate. Nada, nothing, zilch.

   <p>Also, if what I've been hearing is true, there is a liklihood of some
   really terrible additional provisions being added to the basic
   framework of the INDUCE Act (IICA), such as a requirement for file
   sharing filtering being built into filesharing applications.

   <p>Of course, it would be nice not to have to report on rumors. If our
   elected representatives had any trust in democratic processes, they
   would make the various language being batted about and the various
   draft bills public. They certainly wouldn't require a vow of silence
   from the participants in the process.
   
<h>Is There a New INDUCE Act (IICA) Draft? 

   <p>Rumor is that there is a new INDUCE Act (IICA) draft available, but
   the participants have been sworn to keep it quiet while they show it
   to their clients.

   <p>Of course, the clients of the US Senate, aka the people of the United
   States, get no such courtesy from their elected representatives.

   <p>Ain't democracy great?

<h>Burning the Midnight Oil to Create a New INDUCE Act (IICA)

   <p>Well, no version of the INDUCE Act (IICA) has come out of Sen. Orrin
   Hatch's patent-pending throw some of the interested parties in a room
   and not let them out until there is a compromise innovation policy
   development process. The drafting may continue throughout the weekend.

   <p>Reports that observers should watch for black or white smoke from
   Senate offices are mistaken; Sen. Hatch did not insist on following
   medieval precedents in their entirety.

     <p>September 30, 2004

<h>"All-Star" Drafting Team to Create New INDUCE Act (IICA) by Close of
Business Tomorrow

   <p>According to Public Knowledge:

     <p>An all-star game of private sector legislative drafters will start
     at 10:30 tomorrow. There will be representatives from consumer
     electronics, Verizon, CDT, and others on our team and from the
     usual suspects on the other team. They are supposed to produce a
     draft by 4 p.m. That draft will then be, probably revised, to see
     if it can be marked up next week.

   <p>Why on God's green earth does Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) think this is a
   reasonable way to set internet innovation policy? There will
   apparently be no significant reflection or debate, just a rush job at
   the end of the session.

   <p>Unbelievable.

<h>Report from the INDUCE Act (IICA) "Negotiations" 

   <p>Apparently, Sen. Orrin Hatch's staff believes that the Senate
   Judiciary Committee would be criticized if forwarded a copyright bill
   and criticized if it didn't. Criticized by who? The citizens of Utah?
   Are the people of Utah pushing ths bill? Will Sen. Hatch be voted out
   of office if the INDUCE Act isn't passed?

   <p>Sen. Hatch himself was quoted as saying that he wanted the people in
   the room to write the "doggone" bill and that if they didn't he would.
   He also was quoted as saying, "if the bill isnt done this year, it
   will be done next year."

   <p>Great.

<h>Content Industries Meet with Sen Hatch Prior to INDUCE Act (IICA)
"Negotiation"  

   <p>Yesterday I noted that instead of a regular bill "markup" there was
   going to be a massive negotiation among some of the stakeholders
   regarding the INDUCE Act (IICA) (INDUCE Act (IICA) Massive Negotiation
   Session Tomorrow).

   <p>Today, an anonymous source familiar with the process has told me that
   before the main meeting, which is taking place as I post, there was a
   separate meeting between Sen. Orrin Hatch (R - UT) and the content
   industries alone. Have to put together a united front, I suppose.
   
   <p>September 29, 2004

<h>INDUCE Act (IICA) Massive Negotiation Session Tomorrow 

   <p>Word is that there will be no markup of the INDUCE Act (IICA) tomorrow
   as had been previously promised. "Instead, the Hatch staff has invited
   a bunch of people, most of them content people, to a massive
   negotiation session at 1 p.m. in Dirksen 226. This is not a public
   meeting, but could be staked out. MPAA, RIAA, BSA, AOL-Time Warner
   were invited. Consumer Electronics, CDT, Verizon among others."

   <p>At what point will our representatives in Washington figure out that
   this is probably not an intelligent way to determine internet
   innovation policy for the nation?
   
<h>INDUCE Act (IICA) Continues to Threaten 

   <p>Concentrate on some other things for a few days and you fall
   hopelessly behind. I'm also feeling very frustrated that a handful of
   Senators are still trying to push through the innovation-crippling,
   free speech-threatening INDUCE Act on behalf of an industry with
   disproportionate lobbying efforts and profile. It is very sad,
   especially when I consider the pernicious effect it will have on our
   political culture for many years to come (the subject of another
   post). Anyway, simply to catch up, here are some more links:

   <p>One final point. Copyfight pointed to an email sent by the group
   behind the Grammy's encouraging artists to support the INDUCE Act
   (Induce Boosters Send Email to Grammy Members). If artists think that
   it is in their interest to significantly increase the power of the
   publishers as against all others, they are sadly mistaken. When
   copyright law becomes even further unbalanced, it becomes a burden on
   artists just as much, if not more than, consumers.

<h>Staff Draft of INDUCE 2.0 

   <p>The Senate will likely be doing a markup of the Inducing Infringement
   of Copyrights Act of 2004 (IICA, née INDUCE Act), next Thursday,
   September 30th. The draft they will be working off has just been
   released. It is much closer to the original version of the bill than
   the version produced by the Copyright Office a couple of weeks ago.

   <p>Read the 4-page staff draft of INDUCE 2.0: Staff Draft S. 2560 -
   Inducing Infringement of Copyrights Act of 2004 [PDF].

   <p>The bill is much more narrowly drafted with carve outs for everything
   that EFF had in their original mock iPod complaint: iPod, the maker of
   the hard drives and C|Net for reviewing it are also presumably
   protected (Prelude to a Fake Complaint).

   <p>However, the bill retains many of the provisions, including the
   incredibly vague "reasonable person" standard, as well as other
   issues.

   <p>In any case, this is not the final draft, but only something that will
   be futher changed at the markup next Thursday and there may be other
   drafts released between now and then.

<h>Broad Coalition of Organizations Calls for More INDUCE Act (IICA) Hearings

   <p>A broad collection of technology companies, civil liberties groups and
   other organizations have just released a letter calling for further
   hearings on the Inducing Infringement of Copyrights Act of 2004 before
   the bill enters markup. The letter is a response to the new version of
   the INDUCE Act (IICA) proposed by the Copyright Office (which I
   haven't yet written about, but is most definitely on my "to do" list).
   Clearly, Congress should take this letter's advice.

   <p>Read the two page letter: Letter to Senators Hatch and Leahy, Re: S.
   2560, Inducing Infringement of Copyrights Act of 2004, Sep. 17, 2004
   [PDF].

   <p>Text of the letter below:

     <p>Dear Senators Hatch and Leahy:

     <p>The undersigned entities are writing to express their concerns with
     the Copyright Office's September 9, 2004 recommended statutory
     language for a new form of secondary liability for copyright
     infringement. We commend the Copyright Office for its efforts to
     meet with the many different stakeholders and to fashion a
     recommendation that attempts to address the competing interests.
     Notwithstanding the Copyright Office's hard work and creativity,
     the September 9 draft is not ready for mark-up by the Senate
     Judiciary Committee. The draft raises a host of new issues and
     would create an unprecedented new form of liability of uncertain,
     but potentially unlimited, reach.

     <p>The Copyright Office's most recent approach would create a new form
     of strict copyright liability for a large class of providers of
     hardware, software and services used in conjunction with the
     electronic or physical dissemination of goods, services, and
     information. These companies and institutions could be found liable
     without regard to their knowledge, intent, or relationship to the
     infringer, simply for providing a product, service, facility or
     financing. All it takes to be found liable is to meet one of the
     three vague criteria proposed by the Copyright Office, which are to
     be applied to some undefined subset of a defendant's products or
     services. As a result, anyone involved in the development or
     operation of electronic, or even physical, communication,
     distribution, or dissemination technologies could be strictly
     liable when it unknowingly derives revenue that may be small in
     relation to its own provision of goods and services. Perhaps most
     troubling, entities that participate in the Internet and other
     electronic space would have no way of structuring their activities
     to anticipate and avoid -- or even minimize -- these risks.

     <p>The Copyright Office's new draft fails to codify the Supreme
     Court's Betamax decision, which, despite having fostered twenty
     years of explosive growth in technology, is now under unrelenting
     attack. Moreover, the Betamax doctrine will provide no defense
     against the Copyright Office's proposed new form of liability. Nor
     would it be availing to present any defense based on lack of
     knowledge, intent, or affiliation with any infringer. Thus,
     legitimate enterprises may have no effective means of preventing
     the substantial litigation cost of virtually every infringement
     case going to trial. The September 9 draft also explicitly opens
     the door to secondary liability -- posing yet another challenge and
     obstacle -- to those who finance new ventures or "incubate" new
     technologies. Thus, it may sweep up far more than bad actors who
     build business models based in infringement.

     <p>While the decision to embark on a new approach shows that the
     Copyright Office has been willing to listen to criticism of
     previous approaches and to explore new directions, the very novelty
     of this approach suggests that further analysis and review are in
     order. Indeed, each major alternative that has been presented to
     your staff (including those emanating from the private sector) has
     revealed an attempt to avoid the pitfalls of S. 2560 as introduced,
     yet has differed dramatically from other serious proposals. No
     private or public sector consensus has yet formed as to theoretical
     framework and practical impact.
     <p>In the first hearing on S.2560, the Committee called on interested
     parties to propose legislative alternatives. The resulting process
     has led to a number of significant alternatives, which differ
     greatly from the original and from each other. However, each would
     work a fundamental change in copyright law, with potentially
     enormous impact on the competitiveness and economic growth of this
     nation. Before any approach becomes law, it should, at minimum, be
     subjected to careful scrutiny in a public hearing at which novel
     elements in these approaches can be compared, and discussed as to
     their full implications. The process thus far has been
     constructive, but has not resulted in either the consensus or the
     confidence in a legislative framework that ought to underlie a
     major and consequential revision to the Copyright Act.

     <p>We continue to appreciate the seriousness and cordiality with which
     your staffs have approached this issue, and look forward to
     continuing to work with you and with them.

     <p>Sincerely,

     <p>[Numerous technology companies, civil liberties groups and other
     organizations]

   don't worry, it'll be back too.

<h>Copyright Office Report on INDUCE Act (IICA) Complete But Not Yet Public

   <p>Yesterday afternoon, the Copyright Office was to provide a report to
   the Senate Judiciary Committee on the Inducing Infringement of
   Copyrights Act (IICA, née INDUCE Act). See, Senators Put Copyright
   Office in Charge of Finding INDUCE Act (IICA) "Consensus" by Sep 7 and
   Copyright Office Produces 'Discussion Draft' Alternative to INDUCE Act
   (IICA).

   <p>Two sources have confirmed that the report has been submitted to the
   Senate, but the report will not be released publicly until Senate
   staffers have had a chance to review it.

   <p>Of course, I wonder why the delay in making the report public? Is it
   going to change between now and when the Senate deigns to release it?
   Why is this an appropriate way of dealing with a public report?

   <p>Anyway, I've got some other things to do today. Hopefully, I'll be
   able to take a look at it as soon as someone decides the report is fit
   for the people who paid for it.

   
<h>Hatch's Hit List #45 - MIT's I/O Brush 

   <p>What is Hatch's Hit List? Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) has introduced the
   Inducing Infringement of Copyrights Act (IICA, née INDUCE Act) in the
   Senate. The bill would make it illegal to "intentionally induce"
   copyright infringement, but is worded so broadly that it would have
   all sorts of unintended consequences, one of which is to severely
   limit, cripple or kill innovation in many different fields. Hatch's
   Hit List is a daily exploration of some of the technologies and fields
   that the bill would likely affect. See also, Introducing Hatch's Hit
   List and the Hatch's Hit List Archives. Send list suggestions to
   ernest.miller 8T aya.yale.edu.

   <p>Today on Hatch's Hit List: MIT's I/O Brush

   <p>MIT's infamous Media Lab, from which many inducing technologies have
   found their way into the world, has produced a device whose sole and
   only purpose appears to be copyright infringement. Furthermore, it is
   designed to be used by children, training them from an early age to
   engage in copyright crimes! Who knows how many innocents will be
   corrupted by the Fagins and Child Catchers of MIT?

   <p>What is this criminal device? The I/O Brush:

     <p>I/O Brush is a new drawing tool aimed at young children, ages four
     and up, to explore colors, textures, and movements found in
     everyday materials by "picking up" and drawing with them. I/O Brush
     looks like a regular physical paintbrush but has a small video
     camera with lights and touch sensors embedded inside. Outside of
     the drawing canvas, the brush can pick up color, texture, and
     movement of a brushed surface. On the canvas, children can draw
     with the special "ink" they just picked up from their immediate
     environment.

   <p>This is explicitly training children to violate the rights of
   reproduction and derivative works. Unbelievable! Shocking!

   <p>And just what does MIT expect the children to do with their infringing
   works? Undoubtedly, because they are in digital format, share them
   with people! Perhaps they expect that they will be shared via the
   internet! Thus, violating the right of public distribution! A few more
   exclamation points for no apparent reason!!!!!!

<h>Hatch's Hit List #44 - Broadcatching

   <p>What is Hatch's Hit List? Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) has introduced the
   Inducing Infringement of Copyrights Act (IICA, née INDUCE Act) in the
   Senate. The bill would make it illegal to "intentionally induce"
   copyright infringement, but is worded so broadly that it would have
   all sorts of unintended consequences, one of which is to severely
   limit, cripple or kill innovation in many different fields. Hatch's
   Hit List is a daily exploration of some of the technologies and fields
   that the bill would likely affect. See also, Introducing Hatch's Hit

   <p>Today on Hatch's Hit List: Broadcatching

   <p>Combine RSS (w/enclosures) with BitTorrent and you get what I call
   "broadcatching." It is, in my view, a revolutionary method for
   multimedia publishing and distribution without gatekeepers.

   <p>Problem is, like email and http and ftp and p2p, anyone can post any
   sort of content in the enclosures and easily distribute it. In fact,
   undoubtedly, broadcatching will be used by many for infringement.
   People will share their favorite (and copyrighted) television programs
   and movies with others. And, if the RSS is private (aka a "darknet"),
   how will the RIAA or MPAA be able to find and punish the infringers?

   <p>The tools for using broadcatching will undoubtedly encourage people to
   use them for illicit purposes, such as with instructions that "any
   large file could be put into an enclosure" or something similar.

   <p>Clearly, the whole broadcatching thing is going to have to be strictly
   regulated. Perhaps we can require that all RSS feeds be registered, so
   that they can be monitored? Broadcatching software will definitely
   need dialog boxes that ask if the user is sure they want to add
   content to an enclosure, as it might be copyrighted. Newsreaders will
   need dialog boxes that ask subscribers whether they want to download
   the enclosures (they might be copyrighted).

   <p>Because broadcatching is a direct and immediate threat to the business
   models of Hollywood, it will certainly be a prime target for any
   lawsuits Hollywood can throw against it.

<h>Call Congress on Sep. 14 - SaveBetamax.org 

   <p>On September 14th Downhill Battle wants you to call Congress to let
   your representatives know your views on the Inducing Infringement of
   Copyrights Act (IICA, née INDUCE Act): SaveBetamax.org:

     <p>The Betamax ruling is the only thing that protects your right to
     own a VCR, tape recorder, CD-burner, DVD-burner, iPod, or TiVo.
     It's that important. But new legislation that's being pushed
     through the Senate by lobbyists for the music and movie industries
     would override the Betamax decision and create a huge liability for
     any business that makes products which can copy sound or video.
     This legislation (formerly known as the INDUCE Act) would
     essentially give Hollywood veto power over a huge range of new
     technologies. And if they get this power, they'll definitely use
     it: just as they tried to stomp out the VCR in the 70's and 80's,
     the music and movie industries want to force all content to go
     through their own restricted channels.

   <p>Go ahead, register.
