<p>And now, my sadness is overflowing

<p>Don't Lie To Me
<p>by: Amuro Namie
<p>translated by: Curi

<p>yeah yeah

<p>wanna be little girl  Tracing my finger down your back
Walking along with you
Inside your gentle eyes, lonliness was imprisoned
so rumbling the trouble
feeling your life covered with lie in tonight
Your desperate face, once again
Like a puzzle where one piece is missing, oh

<p>don't lie, don't lie to me  If this kind of kiss is
a thread that coils itself around your heart
Then teach me how to unfasten it
don't lie, don't lie to me  Don't decieve me with your words
Raise the limit of your affections, but
I don't need just the shape
gimme your hidden face

<p>you navigate me  silently guiding the back of my neck
It looks like I'm going to lose
If I'm okay now in the future perhaps I'll grow to trust you
be destined to paradise
take it to life, ticket to ride, get it up night
But, however
A fragment with no meaning
It's okay that it's broken
But I can see true love

<p>don't lie, don't lie to me  if in an instant
It looks as if a flower can bloom, that's nature's way
Love can spread, I can find it
don't lie, don't lie to me  If your honesty makes me sad, it's okay
I don't want you to honey coat it
You only have to show it to me
tell me your love belief

<p>don't lie to me
don't lie to me
just try to do the things honestly

<p>you don't have to lie

<p>don't lie, don't lie to me  If you make that kind of promise
If fear is wrapped around my heart
Then tell me how to untie it
don't lie, don't lie to me  Always wandering around
Raise the limit of your affections, but
I don't need just the shape
If this is forever
don't lie, don't lie to me  if in an instant
It looks as if a flower can bloom, that's nature's way
Love can spread, I can find it
don't lie, don't lie to me  If your honesty makes me sad, it's okay
I don't want you to honey coat it
You only have to show it to me
tell me your love belief

<p>LOVEBITE
<p>by: Amuro Namie
<p>translated by: Curi

<p>NEVER GONNA SAY
No one, whoever,  surely wouldn't understand MOONLIGHT
The things of life are heartbreaking to anyone
CRY (YES I DON'T KNOW WHY)
NEVER GONNA SAY
Chance encounter, misunderstanding, those days were worthless
MOONLIGHT
SO LET ME SEE
I only drift through  MY LIFE  (YES I DON'T KNOW WHY)

<p>In the beginning, there was no meaning, I knew the time but...
OH NO  You held me so much
LIKE A LOVEBITE

<p>(I DON'T KNOW WHY, I WANT TO KNOW)
The whispers were LIES... DON'T TELL A LIE
(I DON'T KNOW WHY, I WANT TO KNOW)
They fall from your lips

<p>I FEEL YOU, DARLIN'

<p>In the beginning you just made fun
But...when we were together I learned too much
LIKE A LOVEBITE

<p>Lovin' It- Amuro Namie & Verbal (mflo)
<p>Translated by: Curi

<p>I definetly don't know the name of every morning encounter
Sometimes my smiling face is a look of loneliness
I can't forget I have a modest spirit
Like circumstances from a distant day
Snow still doesn't come
Where did it go? I look at the stars
Are things all right? I'm concerned
Perpetually?

<p>Like the feeling from the night sky dissapearing, latter days
Completely, many times repeating deja vu
It won't stop
Pass by while I'm sitting here, the person reaches out
(It's crazy) Going against instinct
Their real nature revealed
Beginning to become a new legend, I rock it
The challenge is my only thought
Ah, in this way people will meet up
Ah, and people will come together
This is all, but I want this to happen
Who important people have next to them
What important things are next to them

<p> every day every morning
I thank the lord above for the
kindness of your love

<p>every day every morning
I thank the lord above for the
tenderness of your love
of your love...

<p>(RAP)
I be lovin' it, I be lovin' it...human nature
I be lovin' it, I be lovin' it...always progressing
I be lovin' it, I be lovin' it...everyday
I be lovin' it, I be lovin' it...love, lovin' it
I be lovin' it, I be lovin' it...your sensitivity
I be lovin' it, I be lovin' it...always fresh
I be lovin' it, I be lovin' it...everyday
I be lovin' it, I be lovin' it...love, lovin' it

<p>every day every morning
I thank the lord above for the
sweetness of your love

<p>The snow still doesn't come
Things I sadly can't forget, I remember what I've done

<p>Put 'Em Up
<p>by: Amuro Namie
<p>Translated by: Curi

<p>Just one day, suddenly the morning's over
The stupid boys cause a disturbance
Let me see who's over there with club chics
Wherever you look, these snobby Casanovas
Think it's fun to make a habit of cheating
There's nothing like that kind of appearance
I missed the evidence before
But starting now, I think I get it

<p>If I go somewhere, then I can go out
I can do things, I can mess around
Which one is 'beneath me,' ain't nothing new
Anything you do, I'll do it better than you
A flirting love game, fine I can play games
Forgetting your name, I can do the same
I'm the number one sharpest one
It's impossible to deceive a woman's emotions

<p>Secretly bend backward, put 'em up
My unintentional, sudden impulse is your fatal wound
Thanks to you, my weaponry is your dilemma
I can get down, I can get down
The rules of dying abroad
I've exposed your cheating, fool
If you got chics then you better put'em up
You lose, you were too late

<p>The instant the phone rings
In a confused manner, a secret is revealed
In a sweet voice, 'where is she?'
Could this be my challenger!?
I'm not just listening in
I'm using my own judgement
I get in the car
That boy is mine, I believe it

<p>Secretly bend backwards, put 'em up

<p>SO CRAZY
<p>by: Amuro Namie
<p>translated by: Curi

<p>yeah
yeah listen:
Is it love, is it passion,  oh no  on the front lines, on purpose
Showing off all the time, only to do it again
thought it's juss foolish
Too late, someone saw you doing it
The way you break dates with people you meet  i said "sorry boy..."

<p>A sudden indication  eye 2 eye (eye 2 eye)
Moon on a clear night  face 2 face (face 2 face)
Bodies facing each other  heart 2 heart
see my destiny  This instant
Where did you go until now? And
Although I searched the whole time
And whispering to my chest
Drawing you towards me  holdin me too tight

<p>so crazy  my passion awakens
My awoken heart resets
Ooo you step into my life (step into my life)
Everything changes
so crazy  nothing, I don't know
I could keep it closed but I don't know
I maybe crazy however (crazy however)
 No one can stop (crazy 4 ya love)

<p>Almost seduced  Falling for you
funny, it's funny  Up until now I've been by myself
Somehow I know how to laugh  my girls just don't understand
It's a miracle that we ended up meeting  i think he is the one

<p>Always connecting  hand 2 hand (hand 2 hand)
One over the other  soul 2 soul (soul 2 soul)
Trusting our instincts  body 2 body
must be destiny  Absolutely
Harmoniously gazing into each other's eyes
This is the real thing,  this is true
I'm no longer imprisoned
when a girl meets a boy
The impact of love

<p>love
Why did you understand (and say that?)
how did you get to here? (on tell me)
Find out, take it out  bring it all to me
What's the best thing to do  (If I do this..?)
what am i gonna do (do 4 U?)
Even so, I shout out  your name, over and over

<p>hurry up (uhh) I wanna show you my extremely hot body
can't stop (ahh) I can't stop my addictive booty
up in da club (club)

8PM Up against you, my heart rate (uhh me so horny)

<p>i wanna hold you right now
i wanna touch you right now
wanna kiss you, cling to you
love you down all nite, aha...

<p>Infinity
<p>by: Hayashibara Megumi
<p>Translated by: Curi

<p>A falling star shimmers, make a wish
The glossy sand, a childish memory
When I look upon the fairy tale village, it fades
I give up hope for a lifetime

<p>Get Back
One more time the inside of my heart lies idle
The blue sky I remembered long ago explains why

<p> Absurd inside reckless inside vacant
I walk next door
A transparent signpost floats overhead
Only in your heart
A mysterious direction towards infinity
The same folklore all over again
I call out for you to return
Do your best for your sake anytime

<p>The coin splits open and predicts the future
I ease my doubt, this too is for the best
By chance,  if I?m not mistaken it's inevitable
No one needs to have a knack for living

<p>Get lost
In no time the wave grows larger
The time to lose my heart is here

<p>I don't need to be in the high seas
I'm progressing to the next level
I'm taking a new path
I don?t see you walk away
I admit I've lost bravely
In order for victory tomorrow
Your insults made me stronger
You can have your way in everything

<p>TABOO
<p>by: Hirai Ken
<p>Translated by: Curi

<p>Steal your heart
You are my best friend's girlfriend
You'll be mine
It's my taboo

<p>Hey, I know your boyfriend like I know you
Now I sigh as you cross your legs
I'm not afraid. I can see this, so I believe it.'
In your distant eyes, my lies blur
Somehow, in the middle, you're on to me
The day we met in secret on tiptoes still sticks in my mind

<p>To an intense degree, this chain looked like it would become unfastened
Our hands became dirty because of our sins, you are my TABOO

<p>Hmm I should have known. The reason that I met you was?
Strong eyes were angered because of my lies
The stars brought us together
Fingertips on the back entrance, entrusting ourselves to heated anxiety


<p>Leaving you blindfolded, unawares, for a display of gratification
The dark won't abandon you, you are my TABOO

<p>Whomever you are, we make arrangements so this mystery will stay
Your lips are sealed, you are my TABOO

<p>I need to understand, I should be certain
My body is aching, you are my TABOO

<p>You can steal my heart
Gonna make you mine
You'll be mine
It's my taboo

<p>Asia no Junshin
<p>by: Puffy
<p>Translated by: Curi

<p>Peking Berlin Dublin Liberia
Can come together, can find peace
Iran Afghanistan, singing balalaika

<p>Beautiful women, ant line, gum line, lasagna
A computer mouse becomes part of our lives
Access Eleven seems to be for our benefit

<p>We opened a door
Even now
It pours out
Asia

<p>Compare any or all of the white pandas
The pure of heart split open the night sky
And ancient, classical things jump forth, like a spark

<p>Volcano, Magellan, Shanghai, maleria
Causes you to get a fever
Maybe Hong Kong lights twinkle on a hot night

<p>We opened a door
A stream of tears
Overflows
Asia

<p>The river on the map is a flowing constellation
The pure of heart in a chance encounter
We?ve come a long way
Into the future

<p>Compare any or all of the white pandas
The pure of heart display the bright future of the world
Limitless love
A flicker of light
Now access love

<p>Teen Titans Theme
<p>by Puffy
<p>translated by: Curi

<p>Right now we have a knack for protecting people
And whether we like it or not, we'll eat it
A shadow of our true power
Spreads over the landscape from our place
And nothing is outside
Teen Titans Go!
In a loud voice, yell it out
We've only resolved half of the problem
A busy schedule heart
A great scholar's heart
And our wish is to never stop
Whenever people are sad
We're there
Whenever sorrow is imprisoned
We're always...forever...
Right now we have a knack for protecting people
And whether we like it or not, we'll eat it
A shadow of our true power
Spreads over the landscape from our place
And nothing is outside
Teen Titans Go!
