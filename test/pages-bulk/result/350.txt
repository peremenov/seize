   <h>US: American Companies in Iraq Starting from Ground Up

   <p>Washington - When government contractors took on the task of
   rebuilding Iraq's hospital system last year, they were distressed to
   learn that nursing staffs no longer existed.

   <p>Under Saddam Hussein, the contractors discovered, hospitals were
   forced to fire all their nurses to save money.

   <p>"They said nurses weren't needed because family members could do
   that," said George A. Laudato, a vice president of Abt Associates
   Inc., which won a contract to repair Iraq's health care system. Abt
   found a few nurses working as janitors.

   <p>When another contractor took on the job of rebuilding Iraq's primary
   and secondary school systems, the workers found to their surprise that
   renovating the buildings and revising the curriculums would offer no
   help to a large percentage of the school-age children.

   <p>In recent years, several hundred thousand children had dropped out or
   had been pulled out of school "because they weren't learning anything,
   and schools were nasty, filthy places," said Robert Gordon, director
   of operations for Creative Associates International, the company
   involved. Neither his company nor the United States government had
   been aware of this problem.

   <p>After still more federally financed contractors finished creating
   local government councils in all 18 of Iraq's provinces last year, a
   first step toward democracy, they found that many of the new
   government officers were unaccustomed to thinking and acting
   independently.

   <p>"For most of them, there is still a sense that they are waiting for
   someone up above to give them permission to do things," said Aaron
   Williams, an executive with RTI International, the consulting firm
   charged with starting the councils.

   <p>Ten months into the reconstruction effort in Iraq, government agencies
   and private companies have defined their tasks and report they are
   making notable progress in many areas. But they have also grown to
   realize that their missions are far more difficult and complex than
   anyone had anticipated.

   <p>"This is the biggest thing we have ever done, absolutely," said Maj.
   Gen. Robert H. Griffen, deputy chief of the Army Corps of Engineers.
   "In terms of speed, in terms of needs, there's never been anything
   like it."

   <p>John W. Dower, a professor of history at the Massachusetts Institute
   of Technology and an expert on the reconstruction of Japan, noted that
   no such project since the 1940's had approached in scale and
   complexity the one under way in Iraq, and "the money spent in Japan
   was not as big as in Iraq, even in today's dollars."

   <p>Using more than $20 billion budgeted since last winter, the United
   States is undertaking to rebuild bridges, roads, oil fields, ports,
   railroads, sewer systems, airports, postal services and telephone
   networks. Government agencies are trying to revamp the judicial,
   economic and law-enforcement systems as well as rebuild the army.

   <p>Reconstruction workers spent most of last year making emergency
   repairs and assessing the problems. In almost every case, the workers
   said, they determined that the jobs were studded with difficulties no
   one had anticipated.

   <p>"We operate in an ongoing basis in 40 or 50 countries, and every
   reconstruction project presents certain challenges," Randy Harl,
   president and chief executive officer of Kellogg, Brown & Root, said
   in a telephone interview. "But Iraq is unique because you face all of
   the challenges at the same time. All of them." Mr. Harl's company, a
   subsidiary of Halliburton , won two contracts to repair Iraq's oil
   fields.

   <p>Chris Mumm, Iraq project director for the Bechtel Corporation, said
   his company "has never done a job like this, where all the
   infrastructure is interrelated." Bechtel won contracts to repair
   Iraq's electricity network, water and sewage systems, school buildings
   and other public services.

   <p>"This is the first time we have seen it in the raw like this," he
   added in a telephone interview from the Iraqi capital. To fix the
   sewer system, he said, first the electric system had to be repaired.
   To run the power generators, fuel production or importation and
   transport had to be arranged. "It is all tied together in a way I have
   never seen before."

   <p>Mr. Mumm and Mr. Harl, not surprisingly, noted that security, for both
   workers and infrastructure, was a challenge. For equipment, Mr. Harl
   said, the rule was "the moment you are not there, it is gone, plucked
   clean, truly like the turkey carcass after Thanksgiving."

   <p>Development Alternatives Inc., a consulting firm, won a contract to
   restore Iraqi agriculture but found that the first steps were more
   basic than the government had anticipated, including opening
   veterinary clinics, importing medicines and restoring the seed
   industry.

   <p>Mr. Mumm said he believed that his company's work rebuilding Iraq's
   electric and water utilities might not hold up unless the utility
   managers adopted modern operating procedures.

   <p>"We opened the cupboards at the electricity ministry, and they were
   empty," he said. "There were no operating procedures, no standards,
   nothing. They didn't operate like a utility. They just had a lot of
   people who knew about the plants and kept them running because Saddam
   Hussein would kill them if the power went out."

   <p>Mr. Mumm has been in Iraq since last May, and in his view, "it will
   take 5 or 10 years" before the utilities can be operated efficiently.

   <p>Creative Associates, the company involved with education reform,
   foresees a similar time frame for rebuilding an education system.
   Creative has begun a pilot remedial program for 600 of the dropouts.

   <p>"But the challenge is not just in the classroom," Mr. Gordon, the
   company's operations director, said. "It is speaking to the parents,
   food, clothing, lots of things - not unlike the challenges we have in
   the inner city" in the United States.

   <p>Creative also found that even Iraqi students who remained in school
   suffered under a system of autocratic teaching methods that
   discouraged students from asking questions or pursuing independent
   thought.

   <p>Mr. Laudato of Abt found that some hospitals in southern Iraq, whose
   Shiite residents had been persecuted, "were as bad as anything I have
   seen in sub-Saharan Africa."

   <p>"Pools of blood on the floor," he continued. "Lines and needles
   reused. I saw a ward of heart attack victims in Basra, eight of them
   on gurneys, some of them twitching, and they had no equipment to do
   anything for them, not even an IV."

   <p>But even with problems like that, Mr. Laudato said Iraqi patience for
   American involvement was thin.

   <p>"Almost to a person, they told us: `We're happy you're here. We need
   your help. But we hope you can do it quickly and then get out.' "
