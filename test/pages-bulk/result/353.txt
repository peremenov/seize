   <h>CSA #2/Payment of Invoice for Emergency Services

   <p>The County Administrator provided a brief overview of the request for
   authorization to pay a vendor invoice for emergency repair work on the
   CSA #2 sewer system.  He explained that the Auditor would not pay the
   invoice under a warrant as in the past, but was changing the procedure
   and requiring it be authorized for payment through the purchasing
   process.  Mr. Mendez explained that through the purchasing process
   anything over $2,000 requires Board approval.  Mr. Jeff Jewett, Public
   Works Director, explained that in the past Public Works would
   authorize the necessary repairs and once they were completed and
   approved, the invoice was sent to the Auditor's Office on a "warrant
   request" for payment.  The Board requested that the Auditor join the
   meeting in order to discuss the change in process and postponed
   further discussion on the item until the Auditor was available.


   <h>CAO-Personnel/ Liebert Cassidy Whitmore Contract

   <p>The County Administrator explained that the Contract with Liebert
   Cassidy Whitmore would provide training opportunities for Staff.  In

   Mendez indicated that he would be providing the training material
   provided at the session to the Board.  Moved by Supervisor Dorame and

   of Inyo and Liebert Cassidy Whitmore, for special employment relations
   services for the period of July 1, 2002, through June 30, 2003, in an
   amount not to exceed $2,500, contingent upon the Board's adoption of a
   FY 2002/03 budget; and authorize the Chairperson to sign.  Motion
   carried unanimously.


   <h>CSA #2/Payment of Invoice for Emergency Services

   <p>The Auditor, Mr. George Holland, joined the meeting and provided
   additional clarification on the request for authorization to pay a Dr.
   Drain invoice for repair of the CSA #2 sewer system.  He explained
   that while in the past he had paid these types of invoices on a
   warrant request from the Public Works Department, in reviewing this
   invoice he had determined that the CSA #2 was a County operation and
   as such work performed for the CSA #2 should have to follow the
   County's purchasing procedures.  Mr. Paul Bruce, County Counsel,
   explained the difference between a CSD, which is a Community Services
   District and has autonomy in its operations, and a CSA, which is a
   County Service Area, whose operations are governed by the County.
   The Board, Mr. Mendez, Mr. Jewett, and Mr. Holland discussed the
   process change for payment of CSA #2 invoices.  Several Board Members
   expressed concern with the delay in payment of invoices this extended
   process has caused, explaining that it would seem that the vendor is
   being penalized by a change in the internal payment process.
   Alternatives and options to expedite payments were discussed, with the
   Board requesting that a Contract with Dr. Drain for emergency repair
   services be formulated and presented to the Board in the future.
   Moved by Supervisor Bear and seconded by Supervisor Dorame to direct
   the Auditor-Controller to pay an invoice from Doctor Drain, Inc., in
   the amount of $5,714 plus any applicable late charges for annual
   maintenance of the sewer systems, as well as all future invoices for
   work/materials performed for the CSA #2, until such time as a Contract
   for these services is approved.  Motion carried unanimously.

     

   <h>CAO-Personnel/ Employee Organizations MOU Amendments

   <p>The County Administrator and County Counsel provided additional
   clarification on the term of the extension to the Employee
   Organization MOU's.  They explained that the existing terms of the
   MOU's would remain in place until such time as different MOU's are
   approved or negotiations reach impasse.  Moved by Supervisor Hambleton
   and seconded by Supervisor Dorame to approve  A) amendment No. 1 to
   the Comprehensive Memorandum of Understanding between the County of
   Inyo and the Inyo County Employees Association extending the terms of
   the current MOU; and B) Amendment No. 1 to the Comprehensive
   Memorandum of Understanding between the County of Inyo and the Elected
   Officials Assistants Association extending the terms of the existing
   MOU; and C) authorize the Chairperson to sign.  Motion carried
   unanimously.


   <h>BofS/Minute Approval

   <p>The County Administrator requested that the Board divide the minutes
   of the June 25, 2002, Board Meeting into a morning and afternoon
