<h>It's a family affair
     _________________________________________________________________

     <p>A new research centre at the University of Edinburgh has its focus
     firmly on the family.
     <p>DR SARAH CUNNINGHAM-BURLEY and
     DR LYNN JAMIESON are in no doubt as to the importance of better
     understanding of family life.

     <p>Divorce and separation has replaced death as the most common cause
     of the removal of a parent from a child's
     family household.

     <p>Family and personal relationships are crucial to the quality of
     life and health of individuals and to the economic and social well
     being of society. Family issues are at the heart of key areas of
     government action, for example in health care, education, welfare
     and work, as well as within efforts to reduce poverty and promote
     social inclusion: family policy itself links across these areas.
     Damaged personal life may be one of the causes of individual stress
     and ill health, violence and social disruption, and arouses
     considerable public concern.

     <p>It is important to have detailed understanding of trends in
     personal relationships, family formation and dissolution, as well
     as of the impact of cultural, social and economic change on
     personal and family life. Attention needs to be paid to the
     experiences of different sectors of the population, rich and poor,
     majority and minority. Research shows that differential access to
     resources and information can radically affect the course of
     personal life. Information must also be collected across the
     life-course. Adults and children or even older and younger adults
     and older and younger children often do not experience the same
     household event, such as divorce or bereavement or moving home, in
     the same way.

     <p>A new initiative - the Scottish Centre for Research on Families and
     Relationships (CRFR Scotland) - has been funded by the Scottish
     Higher Education Funding Council to help gather and stimulate the
     gathering of such information. The Centre will have its
     headquarters at the University of Edinburgh, but the initiative
     involves collaboration with the University of Aberdeen, the
     University of Glasgow, Glasgow Caledonian University and a wider
     network of links. CRFR's focus on families and relationships
     acknowledges the diversity of ways in which families are created
     and maintained, and the importance of wider networks of kin and
     friends which form the basis of our personal lives.

     <p>Scotland shares trends in personal life that are common to a number
     of European societies, including changes in how people enter and
     leave partnerships, have children and make homes for themselves.
     Over the 1980s the popularity of marriage seemed to decline - the
     average age of first marriage rose, numbers of marriages fell and
     couples living together without being married increased. Now, most
     couples marrying for the first time have lived together before
     marriage, some cohabiting couples never marry and cohabitation
     without marriage is a pattern that seems here to stay. However, it
     cannot be assumed that people no longer want permanent
     partnerships. The limited evidence suggests that never married
     couples setting up home together often have a plan to marry or a
     sense that they are checking out that this is the 'right one'
     before marriage. This is one of many areas needing further
     research.

     <p>At the same time as the number of marriages declined, divorces have
     risen, levelling in the 1990s. Research shows that non-married
     cohabiting couples are as likely or even more likely to separate.
     These trends, delayed marriages, more cohabiting without marriages,
     and increased separation, along with falls in family size, are
     associated with a growing proportion of births outside of marriage.

     <p>There is debate about whether children have a more or less stable
     family life than in the past. Most children born 'outside of
     marriage' in Scotland are registered by two parents, living at the
     same address. Single-parent households are often a consequence when
     partners separate. Divorce and separation has replaced death as the
     most common cause of the removal of a parent from a child's family
     household. The effects of divorce on wider relationships with kin
     and friends, and the subsequent contraction or expansion in how the
     members of a former household see their family is not yet fully
     mapped or understood. While some researchers have exceptionally
     talked to children about these issues, their perspective is often
     particularly neglected.

     <p>Households made up of couples remain the most common household
     type, but couples with dependent children are now outnumbered by
     those with no children. Couples who choose to be childless remain a
     minority but one that has grown slightly and may grow further. The
     numbers of people living alone have also grown and are now about a
     quarter of all households. The combination of longer life and fewer
     births mean that elderly people form a growing proportion of many
     populations and particularly those living alone. The numbers of
     single young people living alone have also increased in recent
     years, particularly in urban centres. Relatively little is known
     about the family, kinship and friendship relationships of those who
     live alone although they are a growing sector of our society.

     <p>One important change of the last decades concerns the interaction
     between men's and women's family relationships and their engagement
     in paid employment. By the end of the twentieth century, in the
     majority of couple households below retirement age, both men and
     women were in paid employment, although many more women worked
     part-time than men. The notion that marriage should be a
     partnership of equals gained strength in the latter half of the
     twentieth century. Surveys of attitudes clearly demonstrated
     increased support for gender equality in paid work, in housework
     and in childcare among both men and women, but with higher support
     for equality expressed by women. Although women's greater
     involvement in paid work has resulted in some men doing more
     housework, research continues to show that many women carry more
     responsibility for housework and childcare, even when both partners
     work full-time.

     <p>Some commentators are confident that this is a temporary lag and
     greater equality is inevitable, while others doubt this. For
     example, research of the 1980s showed that male unemployment was as
     likely to generate a situation of greater tension between men and
     their wives as greater domestic equality. More recent studies
     suggest that the balance of work and family life remains
     problematic for many men and women. Balancing family and work may
     be particularly stressful for low paid workers. The stresses are
     different for different groups and at different stages of the life
     course. These are again issues that need further research.

     <p>There is considerable debate about changes in the meaning of
     'family', in how people feel about family obligations and what
     people typically want from their personal life, in the context of
     these trends. Studies of people's attitudes and ideals reveal that
     most men and women value family relationships very highly. Studies
     also show that people continue to have a strong sense of obligation
     to help family members, although this is not seen as an absolute
     rule but a matter that has to be negotiated. A great deal of work
     remains to be done to understand such trends, their meaning, the
     consequences and casualties, and the exceptions and variations
     among Scotland's diverse population across the life-course.

     <p>CRFR will be an essential resource for evidence based policy and
     practice, through encouraging, providing and collating accessible
     briefings on research findings, and through networking academics,
     policy makers and practitioners. The Centre will encourage the
     practice, within the research community, of writing accessible
     research briefings, and will provide an infrastructure for
     dissemination to a wide audience, producing reviews of published
     research in key areas relevant to policy. Dissemination will take
     place both electronically through a web-site and research and user
     networks, and by a programme of face-to-face events. In this way,
     we shall contribute significantly to the development of users'
     knowledge base, and help deal with some of the tensions between
     those conducting research and the interests of specific sectors. We
     hope the CRFR will become a focal point for putting users in
     contact with academics who would provide expert briefing on
     specific topics. However, these links will also engage users in
     contributing to the research agenda, through the commissioning of
     specific projects, and through planning larger programmes dealing
     with wider and cross-cutting issues.

     <p>Scottish devolution heightens the importance of consolidating and
     developing expertise within Scotland and of extending knowledge
     about families and relationships in Scottish society. Devolved
     government brings the potential for further divergence between
     Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom in relation to
     legislation and policies affecting families and relationships - an
     example within the first year of devolution has been the repeal of
     Section 2a of the Local Government Act.

     <p>Detailed evidence based knowledge needs to be available to policy
     makers and practitioners in their work to improve social
     functioning and lessen social exclusion. The Scottish Parliament
     carries much of the legislative responsibility with respect to
     marriage, divorce, parenthood, children, education, housing and
     social work services. At the same time, the internal procedures and
     boundaries of government have been reconfigured in order to enhance
     opportunities for joined-up approaches to such issues. New ways of
     working include the extensive investigative powers of parliamentary
     committees and the restructuring of Executive portfolios to refocus
     on issues once divided between departments, for example, bringing
     together children and young people, health and community care, and
     in the approach to social exclusion and equality.

     <p>Precisely because family policy is a cross-cutting issue for
     government and the voluntary sector, a strength of the CRFR will be
     its ability to address policy needs in and across a number of
     areas, both reflecting and shaping policy agendas. This distinctive
     combination of changes in governance, and the possibility of
     further divergence in family policy north and south of the border,
     make it particulary important that there is a Scottish-based
     research Centre. This will not only serve Scottish society, but
     also promote Scottish input into British and European debates.
