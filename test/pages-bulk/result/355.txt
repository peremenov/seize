                        <h>McClean Licence Application:
                       Moving to End the Uncertainty

                           
     <p>The McClean Lake mill (top of photo) and TMF have been operating and
                monitored for four years with no harm to the environment.

   <p>Last fall, when a federal court decision quashed McClean Lake's 1999
   operating licence over a technicality, the threat of closure felt very
   real for some 200 people working at the operation. Both COGEMA
   Resources and the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC)
   immediately filed appeals, and then successfully applied for a
   "stay"in the decision until the appeal is settled.

   <p>COGEMA Resources is confident that the arguments for the appeal are
   sound and believes that the original decision should be overturned.
   But until the court case has run its course, there is a cloud of
   uncertainty over McClean Lake. In a move to protect the company,
   customers, employees and contractors from this uncertainty, COGEMA
   Resources has filed an application with the CNSC for a new operating
   licence for the McClean Lake mine and mill. The application for the
   new licence triggers a new environmental assessment of the project.

   <p>"This is an entirely redundant exercise," said COGEMA Resources
   President and CEO Tim Gitzel. "McClean Lake has already been through
   an eight-year environmental assessment and licensing process and has
   delivered outstanding environmental performance since production
   started four years ago."

   <p>In fact, the ruling that quashed the operating licence was not based
   on the performance of the McClean Lake facility, but on a technical
   question about the implementation of the federal government's
   environmental assessment process. Due to the long time frames involved
   in environmental assessment, Gitzel said it is prudent to have the
   licensing process running parallel to the appeal."Undertaking another
   environmental assessment and licensing process does nothing to change
   the protection of the environment at McClean Lake. It is simply
   insurance to protect our people and customers against risks created by
   the September 2002 court decision," Gitzel said.

   <p>The new licence application is for exactly the same activities and
   facilities currently operating at the McClean Lake site: the mill,
   tailings management facility (TMF), mining operations, water treatment
   plants, camp and other supporting facilities. COGEMA Resources is
   asking that the existing licence be revoked when the new EA is
   approved and a new licence is issued.

   <p>As part of the licence application and environmental assessment
   process, the company has initiated public consultation programs to
   give stakeholders an opportunity to ask questions, voice concerns and
   participate in discussions.

   <p>"In early meetings with the Athabasca Economic Development and
   Training Corporation and Athabasca Environmental Quality Committee, we
   found that most comments and questions pertained to the impact of the
   quashed licence on employment and business opportunities," said Bob
   Pollock, COGEMA Resources vice-president, environment, health and
   safety. "There's general recognition that environmental protection and
   economic opportunities go hand in hand. Most people are confident
   we're doing a good job with the environment, so they are more
   concerned about the economic impact."

   <p>Residents of Athabasca communities shared their opinions at a series
   of meetings in early June, when Pollock and a team travelled to
   Uranium City/Camsell Portage, Fond du Lac, Stony Rapids and Black
   Lake.

   <p>At the sessions, residents were given a basic background on why COGEMA
   Resources applied for a new licence and what is involved in the new
   environmental assessment. "We wanted to make it clear that we believe
   we have strong arguments in the appeal, but we are applying as an
   insurance policy rather than continue to live with any legal
   uncertainty," Pollock says. "We also wanted to know what local
   residents had to say about the McClean Lake operation so that we can
   be sure that the new EA covers all of the issues that are important to
   Athabasca Basin residents."

   <p>Other public meetings are planned for Wollaston Lake, La Ronge and
   Saskatoon. Watch the COGEMA Resources web site (www.cogema.ca) for
   ongoing developments on the court case and licence application.

   <p>"Even our American competition friends were wishing us well. We have
   their support and they want us to win for North America," said team
   mate Kelly Kirkpatrick. "We were treated so well in Washington, we
   would have felt like winners whatever the contest results."

   <p>The EA "screening" study will be conducted over the summer and fall.
   Following that will be CNSC licensing hearings. In 2004, subject to
   regulatory approvals, a new licence will be issued.
