            <h>New Chapter - Ambiguous Evidence: Suicide or Murder?



                                <h>Craig Perry

   <p>Robert Perry was found shot to death on March 29, 2001, in a back
   bedroom of his mobile home in Kamiah, Idaho.  He was 83 and had been
   suffering from terminal throat cancer.  Robert Perry's 57-year-old
   nephew, Craig Perry, claimed to have found him while Craig's
   girlfriend, Carol Flynn, then called 911 to report the suicide.  The
   police arrived and filmed the scene for analysis, which was used when
   suspicions grew that this incident was no suicide.

   <p>Kamiah Police Marshal David Hasz described the scene later in court:
   The body lay on the floor, facing the bed.  Blood was coming from the
   back of the frail man's head and a .22-caliber long-barreled pistol
   lay near his feet.  A deck of playing cards was scattered on the floor
   near him.  Perry clutched an oxygen tube in his right hand.

  
   <p>Craig and Carol gave their statements and seemed quite upset, but the
   police had doubts when those statements seemed inconsistent with the
   crime scene.  Their reservations deepened as the pair altered some
   details of their stories. Craig indicated that his uncle had made an
   earlier comment that he was going to "end it," and Craig had tried to
   joke with him about it to dissuade him, saying he did not want to
   clean up the mess.   They also said they'd found him on the floor, but
   then changed that to finding him slumped over on the bed, so close to
   the floor they couldn't believe he was still sitting.  Carol indicated
   that Craig then went to embrace the man, and finding him dead, placed
   him on the floor.

   <p>Prosecutors believed Craig Perry shot his uncle, and six months after
   the incident, Craig Perry was charged with second-degree murder.

   <p>At the trial in June 2004, the background came out.  A month before
   the death, Craig had moved in to the trailer to care for the ailing
   man, and a few weeks later, Carol had joined him.  At the time of the
   incident, both had been in the front room.  Carol said she had heard a
   loud pop and asked Craig if he had heard it. After he asked her what
   she was talking about, they both heard a second one and rushed to the
   room.

   <p>The defense argued that Robert killed himself because he was suffering
   and felt like a burden to his family.   Each side called experts to
   interpret that evidence, most specifically the wound pattern and blood
   spatter evidence.

   <p>The bed, complete with the same bloody sheets, was brought into the
   courtroom, with the blood-spattered headboard. Craig Perry's pants
   were also entered into evidence, as they bore blood spatter as well.

   <p>For the prosecution, Rod Englert, a blood spatter analyst,
   reconstructed the event before the jury, using a stand-in person to
   represent Robert Perry.  He said that the fine mist of blood on
   Craig's pants was not a transfer smear from having handled the body
   but blowback from the spray released upon impact from a bullet, which
   meant that Craig was nearby when Robert was shot.  The fact that he
   had blood on his pants but none on his shirt seemed to contradict his
   statement that he had hugged his uncle when he found him.

   <p>In addition, Englert evaluated the blood on the bed and said that the
   man could not have been shot while sitting there with his head
   slumped, because blood would have hit his legs, and there was none
   found in those areas.  Blood found on the side of the bed indicated
   that Robert had been seated on the floor, leaning on the bed, when
   shot.  Blood on Robert's hands, Englert said, indicated that it was
   impossible that he had shot himself.  It seemed instead to have come
   from contact with blood on the floor.

   <p>However, the pistol was not tested for fingerprints, and no tests were
   done for gunshot residue in the bedroom or on Craig Perry, so
   important evidence for reconstruction was lost.  (A crime scene
   processor claimed the lab used did not accept gunshot residue tests.)
   Also, no second bullet was recovered from the scene, though two shell
   casings were.

                             <h>Dr. Michael Cihak


   <p>Pathologist Dr. Michael Cihak, who performed the autopsy, demonstrated
   how the pistol had to have been held to make the wounds he found on
   the righthand side of the back of Robert's head.  He seemed to think
   it was unlikely that anyone would have chosen that position to shoot
   himself, and showed how awkward it was.

   <p>However, Cihak had already changed his own findings once, based on
   reports.   He had located one large bullet fragment and several
   smaller ones in the skull, and when he learned that one casing had
   been found, he said he had one bullet.  But when he later learned that
   two had been found, he changed that to say that one bullet alone could
   not have caused the wound he found.

   <p>Despite his findings, he admitted on cross-examination that suicide
   could not be ruled out.

                            <h>Dr. Vincent Di Maio

   <p>His testimony was echoed by Dr. Vincent Di Maio, chief medical
   examiner from San Antonio, Texas, and nationally renowned expert on
   gunshot wounds.  He believed that someone other than the victim had
   shot him, and said that only five percent of suicidal shots are behind
   the ear.  He did not believe the man could have fired twice in
   succession.

   <p>To counter that, the defense called surgical pathologist George
   Lindholm, who testified it was possible for a man to shoot himself
   twice with that caliber weapon, because he might not lose
   consciousness the first time.  Lindholm also said that, when shooting
   with two hands, turning the weapon upside down, it was possible to
   shoot oneself that way.

   <p>Stuart James, a blood spatter pattern expert from Florida, interpreted
   the exhibits differently.   He stated that the blood on Craig's pants
   could have come from the blood spewed when his uncle coughed, a
   frequent occurrence during the days leading up to the incident.  He
   did not think a .22-caliber would necessarily produce that kind of
   blowback.  In addition, expelled blood resembles high velocity impact
   spatter.

   <p>James had done an experiment to support his analysis.  He withdrew his
   own blood, put it into his mouth, and coughed against the same type of
   material from which the suspect's pants were made.  The droplets he
   produced were similar in size and shape to those found on the pants.
   When questioned, he said that the velocity of his cough would have
   been similar to that of Robert Perry.

   <p>In further support of suicide, Craig claimed that he had no motive to
   kill his uncle.   The man had no money, and Craig loved him like a
   father.  In fact, after his own father had died, his uncle had raised
   him.  Medical records indicated that Robert's illness had grown worse,
   and his home nurse reported that he had rejected traditional cancer
   treatment. Two days before he died, he had coughed up blood and gone
   to the hospital, where doctors were unable to do anything for him.

   <p>Hours before Robert died, Carol Flynn called the hospital to report
   that he was having trouble breathing.   That same day, she had called
   911 to say he had shot himself.

   <p>Another witness said that Robert was predominantly left-handed, but
   had used his right hand to shoot.  A neighbor and a hunting companion
   agreed that he was ambidextrous.  Both of these witnesses had heard
   Robert speak about committing suicide.

   <p>Numerous character witnesses testified that Craig was a peaceful man
   who had loved his uncle and would not have shot anyone.  He paid for
   all his uncle's expenses and took care of his needs, from feeding him
   to getting him into bed.  There was no evidence that he considered his
   charge a burden.  A nurse said that Craig had remained positive that
   Robert might survive, despite the poor prognosis.

   <p>In support of the homicide theory, there was testimony that, while
   Robert had grown worse, he was taking simple medicines and resisting
   making discussions about his will.   He got angry with his nurse and
   told her, "You already have me in the grave," an indication that he
   was fierce about living.  Police found a newspaper article about
   assisted suicide in a suitcase, along with power of attorney
   documents.

   <p>Also, when police had asked Craig Perry to leave the trailer on the
   day of the incident so they could investigate, he yelled, "You think I
   killed him, don't you!"  Then after being confronted with the blood
   analysis evidence, Craig changed his statement about hearing two pops
   to hearing one and then running to the bedroom--presumably to imply
   that he arrived in time for the second shot.

   <p>A witness also testified that when she found the second cartridge
   under the playing cards, Craig threw it away, saying the police must
   not need it.

   <p>Clearly, the crime scene was poorly processed.  Overlooking a
   cartridge near the body and declining to do any gun shot residue
   analysis, which may have resolved many questions, cloud the issue.

   <p>On June 25, 2004, after two days of deliberations, the jury announced
   its decision: Craig Perry was acquitted of killing his uncle.  Even
   the blood spatter evidence was ambiguous enough to allow for
   reasonable doubt.
