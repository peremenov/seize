                               <h>Project Coast


   <p>South Africa has been developing chemical weapons since the beginning
   of World War I. The development of such weapons was South Africa's
   response to the increasing threat of chemical and biological weapons
   (CBW) use from other countries. The establishment of the 1925 Geneva
   Convention, which banned the use of such weapons in warfare,
   temporarily decreased tensions concerning the threat. However, South
   Africa did not entirely cease production and research of CBW following
   the Geneva Convention. In fact, during World War II, South Africa
   sidestepped the convention protocol and began planning a more
   extensive CBW program, to protect the country from the threat of the
   Nazi regime.

   <p>Following the war, the South African Defense Force (SADF) continued
   with CBW research and development, but on a much smaller scale. Much
   of the CBW produced during that time was tear gas, CX powder and
   mustard gas. The non-lethal agents were utilized mostly to control
   crowds.

   <p>It was not until the 1970's that South Africa's CBW program began
   stepping up production of more destructive agents, despite the
   ratification of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development,
   Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological and Toxin Weapons and on
   their Destruction (BTWC) in 1975. The reasoning behind the increased
   production of more aggressive biological and chemical agents was to
   prevent a total Communist onslaught from the Soviet Union and
   Cuban-backed regimes, which threatened a complete takeover of
   Mozambique and Angola during the mid to late 1970's. It was believed
   that the Cuban troops deployed in those regions at the time had
   chemical weapons, which the South African government feared they would
   use.

   <h>Bacteria for biowarfare

   <p>The apartheid government's largest opponent was the Soviet-sponsored
   Marxist African National Congress (ANC), which was first established
   in the 1920's. In order to gain control of the region, the Russians
   sent masses of arms to the Angolans to use in their fight against
   white Afrikaners and the apartheid government. According to Anthony
   LoBaido, the Russians hoped to take control of South Africa's mineral
   treasures, which included diamonds, titanium and zirconium oxide.

   <p>Much like South Africa's right-wing apartheid regime, the crimes
   committed by the ANC were vast and brutal. Many civilians and
   government officials were ruthlessly murdered in the name of
   liberation. ANC soldiers who refused to fight were physically and
   psychologically tortured and murdered in death camps located in
   Angola. The ANC's primary goal was to wage a campaign against the
   white-led regime that threatened to suppress them at any means.

   
   <h>Remembrance of the Johannesburg uprising

   <p>In 1976, the black residents of a large township in Johannesburg rose
   up against the white Afrikaners' police and the apartheid regime after
   black students were gunned down while protesting the compulsory
   teaching of the Afrikaans language. The incident, known as the Soweto
   uprising, led to the alleged further production and use of the CBW by
   the SADF. Moreover, between 1976 and 1979 a war in Rhodesia (now
   Zimbabwe) caused increasing political and racial tensions within South
   Africa.

   <p>Such tensions were believed to have also led to the use of CBW by the
   SADF and the continued enhancement and extension of the ongoing CBW
   program. According to Gould and Folb's article, The South African
   Chemical and Biological Warfare Program: An Overview, South Africa's
   Prime Minister P.W. Botha called on the country's security forces to
   devise a more efficient method in which to deal with internal, as well
   as external conflicts. The SADF's response to Botha's request was the
   implementation of a new and highly secretive CBW program in April
   1981, code-named Project Coast.

   <h>Prime Minister P.W. Botha

   <p>At that time, Wouter Basson, a 30-year-old cardiologist and personal
   physician to Prime Minister Botha, was hired by South Africa's Surgeon
   General, Major N.J. Nieuwoudt, to work for the SADF's medical military
   unit known as the 7^th SAMS Battalion. His first duties were to travel
   to the west and collect information about other countries' CBW
   capabilities, as well as to make contacts in the international
   scientific and medical community for intelligence purposes. That same
   year Basson traveled to several European countries and returned with
   important information from his fact-finding trip, which he promptly
   reported to the SADF.

   <p>Basson learned that the CBW programs in Western Europe were not
   defensive, but rather offensive in nature, which caused concern for
   the South African government. In order to keep pace with other western
   countries, the SADF put plans for Project Coast in full gear. Basson
   became the project officer of Project Coast and was given the task of
   bringing South Africa's CBW program up to date.

   <p>The aim of the new program was primarily to conduct highly secretive
   research into the various aspects of CBW warfare, including offensive
   and defensive capabilities. Moreover, the program aimed to develop
   CBW, as well as provide conventional and covert support of CBW
   production, technology and industrial operations. In short, Project
   Coast included the research and production of offensive and defensive
   CBW weapons, which explicitly violated the BTWC agreement.

   <p>According to a paper by Burgess and Purkitt, The Rollback of South
   Africa's Chemical and Biological Warfare Program, Basson managed all
   aspects of Project Coast. His duties included the recruitment of
   approximately 200 medical and scientific researchers from around the
   world, management of annual funds of $10 million and the establishment
   and supervision of the program and related companies. Basson's
   activities remained largely unsupervised because those people above
   him in the chain of command lacked the scientific experience and
   knowledge essential for the operation and management of the project.

   <h>Magnus Malan, Minister of Defense


   <p>In an effort to maintain secrecy, Basson created four front companies
   that served various purposes. Gould and Folb claim the front companies
   were created for three primary reasons: 1) to maintain secrecy by
   making it difficult to link the production of CBW facilities to the
   military, 2) to procure chemical and biological related substances,
   which normally would have been difficult for the military to obtain,
   3) to discreetly channel funds from defense accounts to the research
   facilities. The four front companies were Delta G Scientific Company,
   Roodeplaat Research Laboratories (RRL), Protechnik and Infadel, which
   divided into two companies in 1989, D. John Truter Financial
   Consultants and Sefmed Information Services.    [spacer.gif]
