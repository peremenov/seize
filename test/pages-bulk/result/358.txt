                    <h>poems from prison by raegan butcher

    
  
   <p>this is the inaugural book in the
   CrimethInc. Letters series . . .
   <p>This is not the third 'CrimethInc. book,' rather, it is the first
   CrimethInc. Letters book. This is not direct propaganda, nor is it
   similar in most regards to previous CrimethInc. publications. This is
   a new voice, a new form, a new idea, but born of the same fires.

   <p>These are our letters--to the universe. To each other. This is where
   we re-write our histories and create our own cultures without the
   mediation of corporations. When we are too far away from one another
   for campfire storytelling, we use our own voices here, and we use them
   to call out across the distance.
   <p>Authors in the Letters series receive 10-20% (a sliding scale based on
   their financial situation) of the gross revenue for the book as
   payment: this is our effort to actually build sustainability into our
   pricing structure rather than nurture yet another generation of
   victimized, starving artists.
