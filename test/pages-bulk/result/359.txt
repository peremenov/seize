                 <h>Twisting Truth through Classroom Consensus

    <h>Using the Bible to promote inter-faith "dialogue" and "common ground"

                             <h>by Berit Kjos, 2001

             

 
     <p>"The Bible and Public Schools: A First Amendment Guide was prepared
     by the Freedom Forum's First Amendment Center and the National
     Bible Association. It encourages schools to offer courses in the
     Bible as literature....  The guidebook says supernatural happenings
     and divine actions described in the Bible may not be taught as
     historical fact. And it says students should be exposed to a
     variety of religious and secular Biblical interpretations."
     [Diverse Groups Endorse Bible Study Guide for Schools]

     <p>"Critical to any teaching about religion in the public schools
     should be inclusion and respect for a full range of religious and
     nonreligious voices, and a recognition of religious pluralism as a
     source of strength for American society...." The American
     Assembly

     <p>"This is an historic day when we can announce a broad consensus on
     teaching about the Bible in our public schools.... We have found
     common ground for common good." Chuck Stetson, vice chairman of the
     National Bible Association.

     creator of a new world order based on consensus. Mikhail

     <p>Its influential "friends" may threaten the Church far more than its
     obvious enemies. One such dubious ally, the nice-sounding Freedom
     Forum, has won the support of many Christian leaders by joining
     their quest for "religious freedom" in public schools. Few seem to
     realize that the cost of this questionable partnership is the
     purity of God's Word. Remember, the Bible's message ceases to be
     God's uncompromising Truth when slashed by inter-faith criticism,
     judged by group consensus, and molded to fit politically correct
     standards.

     <p>Yet, Christians across the country praise this revival. With their
     approval, a compromised view of the Bible blends with other sacred
     writings and religious messages in the classroom. By a strange
     consensus, these religions are being adapted to fit a new
     interpretation of the First Amendment -- one that twists its
     promised freedom into pretext and control. Thus, schoolchildren
     learn "about the Bible" through a pre-planned group process which
     twists God's truths into the evolving ideals of the planned global
     spirituality. (See Mind Control)
     <p>Leading this movement is Charles Haynes, former director of the
     First Liberty Institute and "senior scholar for religious freedom"
     at the Freedom Forum. He serves on the Board of Directors of the
     Character Education Partnership (see Character Training For Global
     Citizenship) and edited the acclaimed book, Finding Common Ground:
     A First Amendment Guide to Religion and Public Education.



   <p>Note: The updated version of Finding Common Ground is recommended at
   www.pastors.com, Rick Warren's website for pastors around the world.

    <p> Back in 1999, Mr. Haynes' helped write "The Bible and Public
     Schools," an interfaith Guide for teaching Bible in public schools.
     It was endorsed by unlikely partners such as:
     <l>The National Council of Churches and the National Association of
       Evangelicals
     <l> The liberal National Education Association (NEA) and the Christian
       Educators Association
     <l> The Council on Islamic Education and the National Association of
       Evangelicals
     <l> People for the American Way (PAW) and the Baptist Joint Committee
       on Public Affairs
     <l> The National School Boards Association and the Christian Legal
       Society
     <l> The Anti-Defamation League and the Christian Coalition [i,  ii,
       iii]

     <p>These strange alliances alone should raise questions about Charles
     Haynes' First Amendment Guide. So should his membership on The
     Pluralism Project's Advisory Board, which includes Wiccan author
     Margot Adler and Professor Diana Eck, an authority on Hinduism who
     chairs Harvards Committee on the Study of Religion.

   <p>"Pluralism is an achievement.... It requires relationship, it requires
   engagement around a common  table, so to speak, of our civic
   society."   Dr. Diana Eck, whose Pluralism Project CD, "On Common
   Ground:  World Religions in America," won praise from Charles Haynes.

     <p>But there is a bigger reason for concern. Mr. Haynes program plays
     a vital part in a worldwide movement that demands religious
     compromise, a pre-planned consensus, and a global ethic which turns
     God's values upside-down. Take a look at the global context for his
     view of freedom:

     <h>Promote the UN vision for global solidarity. 

     <p>For more than half a century, UNESCO has pursued the goal of its
     first Secretary-General, Julian Huxley -- an avowed Socialist
     leader like his brother Aldous.  Now as then, the UN agency in
     charge of education, science and culture has shown little tolerance
     for those who refuse to bend to its goals:

     <p>"The mission of UNESCO... is that of advancing... international
     peace and the common welfare... We have witnessed... the resurgence
     of nationalism, the growth of fundamentalism and of religious and
     ethnic intolerance. The roots of exclusion and hatred have shown
     themselves even deeper and more tenacious than we had feared...
     Peace... requires, in the words of the Constitution, 'the
     intellectual and moral solidarity of mankind'." (emphasis and
     link added)

     <p>To achieve solidarity, UNESCO must win public consent for
     mind-changing psycho-social strategies that would mold and monitor
     the way people think everywhere. To win this consent, it needs a
     public crisis -- one that's either real, exaggerated or merely an
     illusion. Reality matters far less than public perception.

     <p>The crisis summarized in the UNESCO mission fits the need. With
     help from the media, it has already persuaded people around the
     world that "the resurgence of nationalism, the growth of
     fundamentalisms and of religious... intolerance" is a "global
     threat." This perception can now be used to conform, not only
     nations and "fundamental" Christians to the UN vision, but also the
     Bible itself.
     <p>Christians who love God's Word know that His family is made up of
     people from "every tribe and nation." In Christ, people from every
     race and culture become one. Yet, Biblical Christianity is
     considered too narrow and divisive for the globalist leaders who
     have been planning the new solidarity since 1945. Notice the
     blatant intolerance toward Biblical truth and other "certainties"
     in this 1946 statement by Dr. Brock Chisholm, first head of the
     World Health Organization:

     <p>"We have swallowed all manner of poisonous certainties fed us by
     our parents.... The results are frustration, inferiority, neurosis
     and inability to... make the world fit to live in....

     <p>"It has long been generally accepted that parents have a perfect
     right to impose any points of view, any lies or fears,
     superstitions, prejudices, hates, or faith on their defenseless
     children.... [People with] guilts, fears, inferiorities, are
     certain to project their hates on to others.... Such reaction now
     becomes a dangerous threat to the whole world...."
	 
     <p>God's absolute, unchanging truth simply doesn't fit the new
     ideology. His absolute truth offends those who pursue contrary
     beliefs and lifestyles. It seems "intolerant" and "hateful" to
     those who seek public approval for their own ways. Charles Haynes
     summarizes this view well:

     <p>Bitter culture wars over abortion, homosexuality and other social
     issues are acerbating (sic) our religious differences. Exploding
     diversity is changing the face of our nation, unleashing fear,
     intolerance and hatred in the process. And many Americans are fast
     retreating into their own cultural and ethnic tribes."
     ["21st-century America must build ties, not rifts"]

     <p>Our leaders have a new word for this crisis: separatism. During a
     1991 speech at a Communitarian Conference in Washington D.C., Al
     Gore said, "Seeing ourselves as separate is the central problem in
     our political thinking." (See Clinton's War on Hate Bans Christian
     Values) The opposite of Mr. Gore's separatism is the other "s"
     word: solidarity. To understand its ominous meaning, come with me
     to Habitat II, the 1996 UN Conference on Human Settlements. It
     included a day-long mini-conference on "Solidarity" held at an
     elegant Turkish palace in Istanbul. Here, a panel of global leaders
     moderated by Robert McNeil (of McNeil and Lehrer), outlined the UN
     agenda for religious unity and social control. I taped and
     transcribed their comments. Compare some of their remarks (in
     boxes) with the comments by Charles Haynes and others who have
     joined his crusade.

     <h>Use spiritual unity to build the global community  

    <p>I have gathered leaders with tremendous wisdom and prestige. They are
   bringing the spiritual dimensionthe only ingredient that can bind
   societies together. Conference Secretary-General Wally NDow,
   Solidarity panel

   <p>Whats needed is an interfaith center in every city of the globe. The
   new interfaith centers will honor the rituals of every faith tradition
   and provide opportunity for sacred expressions needed to bind the
   people of the planet into a viable, meaningful, and sustainable
   solidarity. James Morton, Cathedral of St. John the Divine and Temple
   of Understanding, Solidarity panel

     <p>The Temple of Understanding, housed in the Cathedral of St. John
     the Divine, serves as a meeting place for various occult,
     inter-faith, and UN groups. Here international policy-makers have
     planned their steps for establishing the global spirituality needed
     as an ethical foundation for the envisioned global community. The
     Temple helped establish the Parliament of World Religions as well
     as Gorbachevs International Green Cross.  According to its Winter
     1993 Newsletter,

     <p>The purpose of the Temple of Understanding is the worldwide
     promotion of interfaith dialogue and education, to achieve
     understanding and harmony among the people of the worlds religions
     and beyond. We invite your active participation and support.
     (emphasis added)

     <p>A 1991 Temple Newsletter shows the inter-faith/occult institution's
     agreement with- and support for Charles Haynes and his Bible
     curriculum. Considering that liberal media leader Henry Luce III,
     who signed the Williamsburg Charter, was also a Temple board
     member, the broad associations should be no surprise:

     <p>The Temple of Understanding is collaborating with three other
     international interfaith organizations to form the International
     Interfaith Organizations Coordinating committee, which has been
     meeting to develop plans to celebrate 1993 as 'A Year of
     Inter-religious Understanding and Co-Operation' by sponsoring a
     centennial celebration in Bangalore of the 1893 World Parliament of
     Religions..

     <p>Hartley Films Offered Free to the Public Schools.  Elda Hartley,
     who began in 1965 to produce films on all the worlds great
     spiritual traditions [except Christianity], has made her
     award-winning films on Eastern religions available through the
     Temple of Understanding to school libraries throughout the United
     States.

     <p>[Statement by Elda Hartley:] We all wonder what we can do to
     promote global understanding. One way is to spread understanding of
     other peoples beliefs, and here at the Temple of Understanding we
     think that the best place to start is with young people in their
     formative years.

     <p>"We are encouraged by the fact that teaching about religion in the
     schools is receiving official approval in a growing number of
     states. ...  five states in the U.S. have offered pilot programs
     with a religious-liberty curriculum issued by First Liberty
     Institute, a coalition of educators and religious groups formed in
     1988....

     <p>Charles Haynes, director of the institute has written that Growing
     numbers of educators throughout the United States recognize that
     study about religion in social studies, literature, art, and music
     is an essential part of a complete public school education. States
     and schools districts are issuing news mandates and guidelines for
     the inclusion of teaching about religion in the
     curriculum....'"

     <h>Redefine terms for a new social contract 

   <p>Citizenship for the next century is learning to live together. The
   21st Century city will be a city of social solidarity.... We have to
   redefine the words... [and write a new] social contract. Federico
   Mayor, former head of UNESCO

     <p>In his article, "21st-century America must build ties, not rifts,"
     Charles Haynes wrote,

     <p>One key deterrent to the disuniting of America lies in reaffirming
     what it means to be an American. An American is one who has an
     abiding commitment to the democratic first principles.

     <p>Is it? That's not what I learned when I became an American citizen.
     These "democratic first principles" are part of Mr. Haynes'
     definition of the First Amendment. They represent a new way of
     looking at the Bill of Rights -- one that ties the right to express
     one's faith to a responsibility to participate in a manipulative
     group dialogue. (See Trading U.S. Rights for UN Rules) This form of
     dialogue teaches each person to replace individual thinking with
     collective thinking under the noble banner of "common good."  But
     his definitions include other details.

     <p>Finding Common Ground outlines the social contract for the global
     village. It also illustrates how its group of authors did "redefine
     the words" and introduce a new social contract. Quoting from the
     Williamsburg Charter, which laid the foundation for The First
     Liberty Institute headed by Dr. Haynes, it states,

     <p>"The Compact Must be Mutual.   ...that rights are universal and
     responsibilities mutual is both the premise and the promise of
     democratic pluralism.. From this axiom derives guidelines for
     conducting public debates involving religion."

     <p>"First, those who claim the right to dissent should assume the
     responsibility to debate: Commitment to democratic pluralism
     assumes the coexistence with one political community of groups
     whose ultimate faith commitments may be incompatible, yet whose
     common commitment to social unity and diversity does justice to
     both the requirements of individual conscience and the wider
     community. A general consent to the obligations of citizenship is
     therefore inherent."

     <p>"Second, those who claim the right to criticize should assume the
     responsibility to comprehend. Genuine tolerance honestly weights
     honest differences and promotes both impartiality and pluralism.
     Debased tolerance results in indifference to the differences that
     vitalize a pluralistic democracy."

     <p>"Third, those who claim the right to influence should accept the
     responsibility not to inflame."

     <p>The last statement points to a basic, though unstated, ground rule
     for the consensus process: Don't offend the diverse group members
     with politically incorrect expressions. Unpopular facts or ideas
     clash with an essential part of the transformational process:
     building trusting relationships that bridge the inter-faith and
     cross-cultural divisions. Naturally, it doesn't take long before
     the group's disapproval intimidates most dissenters into silence.
     Few Christians dare voice contrary facts, values or beliefs that
     might violate another person's comfort zone. That's against the
     rules!

     <h>Trade individual thinking for collective thinking.

   <p>Change your whole way of thinking, because the new order of the spirit
   is confronting and challenging you. Millard Fuller, Habitat for
   Humanity

     <p>In 1995, UNESCO's Commission on Culture and [human] Development
     issued a  report titled, Our Creative Diversity. On page 11, it
     states that...

     <p>The challenge to humanity is to adopt new ways of thinking, new
     ways of acting, new ways of organizing itself in society, in short,
     new ways of living."

     <p>The message behind these words is staggering. Everything must be
     changed -- especially the way we think of ourselves in relationship
     to the "greater whole."   When applied to religion, the "new ways
     of thinking" means setting aside "narrow" or inflexible beliefs for
     the sake of unity and "common good."  Christianity must either bend
     or break.

     <p>When students evaluate the Bible from this pluralistic or
     collective point of view, they are forced to criticize their own
     beliefs and compromise all truths that don't fit the new mental
     framework. Only a cross-less, malleable, ever-changing form of
     Christianity would pass the test.

     <p>To make sure high school students don't escape this mental
     training, Charles Haynes calls for a conclusive course for high
     school seniors. In his article, "The Relationship of Religion to
     Moral Education in the Public Schools," co-authored by Professor
     Warren Nord (University of NC at Chapel Hill) and posted on the
     Communitarian Network), he said,

     <p>"We also believe, however, that there should be room in the
     curriculum for a capstone course that high school seniors might
     take, in which they learn about the most important frameworks of
     moral thought, secular and religious, historical and contemporary,
     and how such frameworks might shape our thinking about the most
     urgent moral problems we face.

     <p>"...It is striking to us that most economics texts (quite properly)
     include discussions of Marxism and socialism, but none that we have
     seen says anything significant about religious ways of thinking
     about economics."

     <h>Guide change in the "right" direction 

   <p>We should stop bemoaning the growth of cities. Its going to happen and
   its a good thing, because cities are the vectors of social change and
   transformation. Lets just make sure that social change and
   transformation are going in the right direction." Dr. Ismail
   Serageldin, Vice President of the World Bank

     <p>"The right direction" means shifting from the Christian worldview
     (or paradigm) to the Global worldview. Some call it a paradigm
     shift. Look at the three main paradigms (ways of thinking and
     understanding reality) of the last fifty years. Notice that secular
     humanism was only a brief transition stage. By the turn of the
     millennium, our culture had generally embraced the global paradigm.
     Religion is once again acceptable -- as long as it reflects the new
     pluralism.

 

     <p>Professor John Goodlad worked on the 1987 Study Commission on
     Global Education with Bill Clinton and Ernest Boyer, former
     president of CFAT (Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of
     Teaching).  Boyer, in turn, supported Charles Haynes' agenda for
     using the Bible to spur interest in interfaith dialogue. In his
     Preface to Schooling for a Global Age, Goodlad wrote:

     <p>Enlightened social engineering is required to face situations that
     demand global action now. Parents and the general public must be
     reached also, otherwise children and youth enrolled in globally
     oriented programs may find themselves in conflict with values
     assumed in the home.

     <p>Does this sound like manipulation and brainwashing? It should!
     Successful "social engineering" must mold the minds of the masses
     so effectively that no rational argument can persuade the people to
     turn back. In the light of Professor Goodlad's vision -- and of the
     paradigm shift shown above -- consider the meaning behind the
     following statements from UNESCOs report, Our Creative Diversity:

     <p>Education must inform but it must also form, it must provide them
     with a sense of meaning to guide their actions.  Education should
     promote rational understanding of conflict, tensions, and the
     processes involved, provoke a critical awareness and provide a
     basis for the analysis of concepts that will prevent chauvinist and
     irrational explanations from being accepted.

     <p>"Its primary task is to provide information, explain and analyze
     problems and subject them to criticism.  It should cover adults as
     well. The principle of lifelong education should be the aim of all
     societies.[10]

     <p>The second paragraph shows three important steps in the consensus
     process: Provide the selected pieces of  information needed to
     persuade the group members, explain the problems (or crises) from
     the global or pluralistic perspective, then subject it to the
     criticism of the group. The members will think their ideas are
     their own, never realizing they were suggested to them by the
     information and context provided by the facilitator. Eventually,
     these steps to "Finding Common Ground" becomes a lifestyle.


     <p>Back in the fifties, Edward Hunter wrote the book, Brainwashing, an
     insightful expose documenting Soviet brainwashing strategies in
     China and other Communist countries. A summary of his book can be
     found in the U.S. Congressional Record. (See Communist
     Psychological Warfare) Mr. Hunter's warnings should shine a red
     light into our foolish presumptions that this process couldnt be
     used in our free nation. Compare his warning below with the
     above comment from Our Creative Diversity: 

     <p>Even when he stands by himself, the truly indoctrinated communist
     must be part of the collective. He must be incapable of hearing
     opposing ideas and facts, no matter how convincing or how forcibly
     they bombard his senses.  A trustworthy communist must reach in an
     automatic manner without any force being applied.

     <p>The following statement from "The Relationship of Religion to Moral
     Education in the Public Schools" by Charles Haynes and Warren Nord
     is less explicit but brings a similar message:

     <p>Moralities are grounded in worldviews that make sense of them, that
     render them rational, that give them cultural and intellectual
     force."

     <p>In other words, the key to change is establishing in the minds of
     people the new world view -- the collective way of thinking, of
     seeing and of understanding social issues. The main strategy for
     accomplishing this change is the consensus process.

     <h>Break down boundaries and build consensus

     <p>The UN vision for global solidarity demands continual measurement
     of social capital in every community. To raise their score on this
     international assessment of community oneness, leaders are seeking
     ways to involve everyone in the consensus process.  Two of the more
     common labels for this process are "Conflict Resolution" and
     "sensitivity training."  While it often helps to resolve genuine
     conflicts (that's the crisis needed to bring people into the
     process), it's main purpose is to change the way people think and
     relate to each other.

     <p>The vision for this social transformation was articulated back in
     1948 in a statement titled, "Mental Health and World Citizenship,
     prepared for the International Congress on Mental Health, which met
     in London. Notice their strategy for change:

     <p>Social institutions such as family and school impose their imprint
     early Thus prejudice, hostility or excessive nationalism may become
     deeply embedded in the developing personality often at great human
     cost.... Change will be strongly resisted unless an attitude of
     acceptance has first been engendered. 

    <p> Now, more than five decades later, there is little resistance to
     the planned social transformation. In Finding Common Ground,
     Charles Haynes, tells us that,

     <p>Establishing a climate where people listen to one another requires
     that we go beyond labels and rebuild trust.  Putting aside labels
     and stereotypes and taking seriously the position of the other side
     are the starting points for genuine dialogue.

     <p>Sounds good, doesn't it?  People long for a climate of trust and
     friendliness.  The question is: can you trust this process?
     Designed to manipulate groups toward a pre-planned change in
     values, Mr. Haynes' principles will indeed "create an attitude of
     acceptance" for the new way of thinking. But this attitude tends to
     immunize children against Biblical faith. Rather than promoting
     neutrality, it promotes pluralism and a universalist distortion of
     Christianity.

     <p>Mr. Haynes assures his followers that all beliefs must be
     respected. That's partly true. But continual tension and compromise
     is essential. "Conflict and debate are vital to democracy," writes
     Haynes in Teaching the Role of Religion in American History.

     <p>Haynes' assurances only make his program more deceptive. Keep in
     mind, conflict and dialogue are vital to the consensus process. And
     the trained teacher/ facilitator can't lead the dialogue
     effectively without the tension created by diversity. This tension
     energizes members and, when used correctly, produces synergy. You
     can't train people to compromise (or synthesize) without opposing
     views -- a "thesis and antithesis." That helps explain why the
     consensus process must include all these elements:
     <l> a diverse group
     <l> dialoguing to consensus
     <l> over a social issue
     <l> led by a trained facilitator
     <l> toward a pre-planned outcome 

     <p>The true dialectic group never reaches a final consensus, for
     change must an ongoing process: one step today; another tomorrow.
     Continual change is a global motto. To permanently change the way
     people think and relate, our leaders must continue to set the stage
     for conflict and compromise week after week, year after year. Group
     thinking and the dialectic process must become as normal as eating.
     Eventually, people learn to discard all their old mental anchors
     and boundaries -- all the facts and faith that maintained their
     firm convictions. They become like boats adrift, always ready to
     shift with any wind or current that comes their way.

     <p>The Association for Supervision and Curriculum (ASCD, the
     curriculum arm of the NEA) has supported Mr. Haynes programs  for
     many years. In 1970, it published To Nurture Humaneness, which
     offers a glimpse of the envisioned goal:

     <p>"...absolute behavior control is imminent.... The critical point of
     behavior control, in effect, is sneaking up on mankind without his
     self-conscious realization that a crisis is at hand. Man will...
     never self-consciously know that it has happened."

     <p>This statement by Professor Raymond Houghton points to the
     effectiveness of today's sophisticated version of the old Hegelian
     dialectic process -- the heart of the Soviet brainwashing system.
     It was infused into the U.S. education even before 1985, when
     President Reagan and Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev signed a
     formal U.S. - USSR Education Exchange Agreement. Finding Common
     Ground fits right in. Its prescribed steps to transformation match
     the corresponding steps taught by UN leaders, by management guru
     Peter Drucker, and by church growth leaders such as Rick Warren:

     <l> "Agree on the Ground Rules"

     <l> "Include All of the Stakeholders"

     <l> "Listen to All Sides"

     <l> "Work for Comprehensive Policies"

       <h>1. "Agree on the Ground Rules" (Leaders agree, others follow):

     <p>Finding Common Ground lists some basic principles for small group
     dialogues that sound reasonable. Problem is: the words they use
     hide new meanings that change the context. "Rights" include the
     politically correct "right" not to be offended by contrary truth or
     arguments. "Respect" includes the "right" to be appreciated and
     affirmed, no matter how irrational or unbiblical one's beliefs.
     Responsibility, among other things, refers to the obligation to
     follow the new social guidelines. Group members are held
     accountable, not to personal convictions, but to ambiguous and
     open-ended "rules" such as these:

     <p>"These principles are the ground rules within which we negotiate
     our differences  At the heart of these principles, are the three Rs
     of religious liberty: Rights Responsibilities Respect.

     <p>If these civic ground rules are in place, then all sides come to
     the  table prepared to take responsibility to protect the rights of
     others and to debate differences with civility and respect

     <p>Hidden in these phrases is the understanding that absolute facts
     and uncompromising faith in God's Word are not appropriate in the
     consensus process. Words that imply that your beliefs might be more
     true than other beliefs could offend the group. Therefore,
     participants may freely share their thoughts and feelings, but not
     their uncompromising convictions.

     <p>In this context, it makes perfect sense that Charles Haynes and
     Warren Nord would emphasize the law that backs this rule:

     <p>the courts have made it clear that public schools cannot teach
     students that the Bible is true.

     <p>In his online article, Educators, theologians agree on
     Bible-teaching guidelines for public schools, Mr. Haynes rephrases
     this essential understanding:

     <p>Supernatural occurrences and divine action described in the Bible
     may not be taught as historical fact.

     <p>This policy is as important to the new international education
     program (see Mind Control) as it is to Mr. Haynes and the Freedom
     Forum. Back in 1989, Dr. Shirley McCune summarized this policy in
     her keynote speech at the Governors Conference on Education:

     <p>The revolution in curriculum is that we no longer are teaching
     facts to children. We no longer see the teaching of facts and
     information as the primary outcome of education.

   <p>"What will take the place of logic, fact and analysis in the coming
   age?" This rhetorical question was raised by Dr. Donald A. Cowan,
   president emeritus of the University of Dallas. His revealing answer
   exposes an important step toward the new consensus:

     <p>"The central way of thought for this new era will be
     imagination.... Imagination will be the active, creative agent of
     culture, transforming brute materials to a higher, more knowable
     state."

     <p>Why is the imagination so important to the new way of thinking?
     Because, unlike fact and faith, the imagination can be manipulated
     through all kinds of stories, myths, and images. By putting
     "teaching about the Bible" into a context teeming with timeless
     myths and inter-faith idealism, God's Word becomes little more than
     just another myth, a collection of stories -- one that may seem far
     less noble than other, less honest, "sacred" books.

                    <h>2. "Include All of the Stakeholders"

     <p>Remember the UNESCO goal: solidarity. To reach this goal, its
     worldwide education system must involve everyone -- young and old
     -- in the consensus process. To end separatism, every mind must be
     molded to fit the new paradigm. Each person must learn to think
     collectively and follow the group -- which in turn must be
     manipulated by a trained facilitator.

     <p>Finding Common Ground echoes this aim: If agreements and policies
     are to inspire broad support in the community, all stakeholders
     must be fully represented in the discussion...."

     <p>To help schools deal with resistance from Christian parents, it
     offers this advice, When school boards or administrators reach out
     to critics particularly religious conservatives, they must look
     beyond media stereotypes and identify those representatives most
     interested in dialogue and consensus.

     <p>Engaging your "enemies" in the consensus process is vital to the
     new global management system. That's why the same advice is
     emphasized in strategy reports from the United Nations, from the
     President's Council on Sustainable Development, from the U.S.
     Department of Education (See The U.N. Plan for Your Community), and
     from Church Growth managers across the country.

     <p>Linda Grenz has won the praise of Charles Haynes. She wrote the
     Doubleday Pocket Bible Guide for the National Bible Association at
     the request of its vice chairman, Charles Stetson. Her management
     program, Dynamic Strategic Planning is a method of effectively
     pursuing a goal or goals in a rapidly changing world."

     <p>[It] is an ongoing process of planning that enables a congregation
     to make plans but also to adapt and change.  In fact, the
     underlying assumption is that the plans will change and that they
     must change if the Church is to be effective in today's world."

    <p> UNESCO leaders would smile. In the 1993 report, Education and Human
     Development, they wrote that UNESCO Education is aimed at two
     essential goals:
    <l> SOCIALIZATION:  Education for all the world's citizens is
       essential because education is the principal means for preparing
       people to participate effectively in the development of their
       communities .
    <l> TRAINING FOR GLOBAL WORKFORCE: Education must prepare the citizens
       of today to live and work in a world in which the only constant
       will be change.

   <p>"All the world's citizens" naturally includes parents. So it makes
   sense that Mr. Haynes and Mr. Nord, writing for the Communitarian
   Network, echo our Department of Education's goal of involving all
   parents in the consensus process. In their section on "Parental Rights
   and Responsibilities," they write:

     <p>"A civil public school is also one that recognizes, in the words of
     the Statement of Principles, that parents have 'the primary
     responsibility for the upbringing of their children, including
     education.' This means that parents should be informed and involved
     when the school addresses religion and religious liberty."

   <p>That statement may sound innocent enough, but it tells us that Haynes
   is working right along with our Department of Education on involving
   parents in the new "seamless" system of "Lifelong Learning." As
   Professor John Goodlad said, "Enlightened social engineering is
   required.... Parents and the general public must be reached also,
   otherwise, children and youth enrolled in globally oriented programs
   may find themselves in conflict with values assumed in the home."

                          <h>3. "Listen to All Sides"

     <p>Finding Common Ground tells participating schools that...

     <p>"Establishing a climate where people listen to one another requires
     that we go beyond labels and rebuild trust. Putting aside labels
     and stereotypes and taking seriously the position of the other side
     are the starting points for genuine dialogue.

     <p>That sounds good until you apply the ground rules that create a
     climate of intimidation for all politically incorrect beliefs and
     facts. Since unpopular beliefs might offend the group, dissenting
     voices are often silenced or minimized in the group's concluding
     opinion or "common ground."

                    <h>4. "Work for Comprehensive Policies"

     <p>Finding Common Ground, encourages teachers to begin the search for
     common ground with the areas where agreement is most likely to be
     achieved Once the first agreement is reached, a foundation is
     created for consideration of more divisive questions.

    <p> It makes sense, doesn't it. Once a group has built a measure of
     programmed "trust" and established pattern of compromise and
     consensus on small issues, its far easier to compromise on bigger
     issues. Eventually, no one dares think or conclude any significant
     issue without considering the feelings of the group. Few now dare
     dissent for fear of violating the group standard for supportive
     relationships.

     <h>Follow God's unchanging guidelines 

     <p>Using Charles Haynes approach to "teaching about the Bible," would
     Christian children learn to stand firm, as God instructs, on the
     basic -- but politically incorrect -- truths of the Gospel? For the
     likely answer, ponder these differences -- take to heart God's
     Word, our weapon against the forces of deception and darkness:


   
   <p>Relationship to the group or community determines personal identity.
   Relationship to Jesus Christ determines personal identity. "I have
   been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live but Christ
   lives in me...." Gal. 2:20
   <p>Aim to please the group. Don't violate the group's comfort zone with
   offensive facts or beliefs.  Aim to please God, not people. Do good to
   others, but don't depend on their feel-good responses.  "Or do I seek
   to please men? For if I still pleased men, I would not be a
   bondservant of Christ." Gal. 1:10
   <p>Trust group consensus to evaluate beliefs, define values and give
   meaning.  Trust God's Word, not group opinion.  Our faith must be
   grounded in the Bible, His revelation of the eternal, unchanging and
   inerrant truth for all times.  For "without faith it is impossible to
   please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that
   He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him." Hebrews 11:6
   <p>Always be ready to compromise for the sake of group relationships.
   Stand firm, don't compromise.  No matter what the pressure, don't let
   politically correct ideals change God's message through His Word.
   Instead, "stand against the wiles of the devil. Therefore take up the
   whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day,
   and having done all, to stand."  Ephesians 6:11-12
   <p>Establish solidarity through the community by manipulating minds,
   through UNESCO's "lifelong learning," and by changing the culture.
   Seek peace and unity in Christ, not in human plans.  Good intentions
   can't win spiritual battles. Apart from Christ, peace and unity are
   illusions.  "These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may
   have peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good
   cheer, I have overcome the world." John 16:33
   <p>Conform to evolving group views to the pre-planned values of the
   envisioned global community.    Be transformed by His Word, not
   conformed to the world.  The "new ways of thinking" bring deception,
   while His thoughts bring the delight of His presence.   "Do not be
   conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your
   mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect
   will of God...."  Rom. 12:2

     <p>"...you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you
       wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All
       Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for
          doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
                    righteousness...." 1 Timothy 3:15-16
