   <h>Excerpts from Crooked Cucumber
     _________________________________________________________________

   <p>Part II, America, 1971, Chapter 19 - Final Season: Autumn

  

     <p>I'm putting this last chapter of Crooked Cucumber on cuke.com
     because Ryuho Yamada plays a role in it and I'm putting stuff on
     the site about Ryuho. His parts herein are encased in yellow. What
     I don't say in the book is that after Suzuki, with his wife
     present, had announced that he had cancer to his disciples, who
     were there in the city and who'd come from outside not knowing why,
     and to Ryuho, Ryuho was said to be the only one who cried. And he
     cried hard, sitting on the floor. He was devastated and he emoted
     without reservation though he'd only known Suzuki for two weeks at
     the time. - DC
       ______________________________________________________________

   <p>To observe things in a flashthat is nonduality. 


   <p>Silas had given some lectures that summer at Suzuki's behest. In early
   September Suzuki asked Silas to come see him. As they talked, seated
   in the tatami room of Suzuki's apartment, Suzuki fingered his mala, a
   Buddhist rosary. It had large sandalwood beads, each carved into the
   shape of a skull. Silas looked at the skulls and at Suzuki, and he
   felt deeply apprehensive.

   <p>Suzuki was very ill. His skin was yellow; the doctor said he had
   hepatitis. Okusan was taking care of him with assistance from Yvonne,
   who also kept him abreast of Zen Center matters. They were very
   careful to avoid infection and didn't share any food with him, as had
   been their habit. Aside from attending an occasional zazen, the last
   time he'd done anything in public was the lay ordination for
   fifty-five students at the end of August. He hadn't even been able to
   attend his own ordination of four new priests in September. Katagiri,
   now called Katagiri-roshi at Suzuki's request, performed it for him by
   proxy, having come up from Tassajara where he was leading the practice
   period. Ed Brown was first in line, then me, then Lew Richmond, who'd
   been studying with Suzuki since 1967, and Angie Runyon.

   <p>Suzuki's absence was conspicuous. It was a somber occasion. Afterward
   we all went to his apartment to greet him and stood at his bedside. He
   acted like it was the happiest day of his life. After leaving his room
   I went up on the roof of the building, walked amidst the potted
   plants, looked out over San Francisco, and cried.


   <p>A young monk named Ryuho Yamada arrived from Japan in late September.
   Over tea, Okusan learned that he knew the healing arts of shiatsu
   (pressure-point massage) and acupuncture. She asked him to give her a
   treatment, and he passed the test. He was supposed to have gone
   straight down to Tassajara, but now he was needed in the city. Every
   afternoon he worked on Suzuki for a couple of hours.


   <p>Ryuho was a thick-spectacled, enthusiastic, naive young monk, and he
   immediately started gobbling up the strange experience of Zen in
   America. He knew quite a bit of English and spent a lot of time
   talking with students.

   <p>"Ryuho-san, if you continue to live in America, and you want to be a
   success in America, you have to be majime. If you are not majime you
   will not be appreciated." Suzuki was sitting up in bed, talking in
   Japanese to the new monk. Okusan had told him the same thing. "Just be
   majime and you'll have nothing to worry about."

   <p>Majime is usually translated as "serious," but it includes the
   qualities of sincerity and enthusiasm. In Japan, Ryuho knew he could
   easily get by as a priest with canned majime; there were centuries of
   tradition and the cloud of vagueness to hide in. But in America the
   students were straightforward, and everything was clear. He loved the
   communal aspects of Zen Center: the natural food, women and men living
   together on an equal basis. Even Suzuki's wife was willful and would
   tangle with him. The students saw in Ryuho, as in other Japanese
   monks, qualities that they admired. A perfect place for Japanese
   monks, he thought. They can learn from us, and we can learn from them.

   <p>Ryuho discovered Suzuki could be short-tempered. Once Ryuho commented
   on a Buddha statue, casually saying it was just a piece of wood.
   Suzuki barked at him not to speak so flippantly: until he knew the
   true meaning of the statue he should shut up. Then as quickly as the
   anger came, it was gone. Ah, thought Ryuho, he's innocent and honest,
   like a child.


   <p>"So, you've come to see our yellow roshi," Yvonne said, and that's how
   Albert Stunkard learned Suzuki was ill.

   <p>"Yellow?" he asked.

   <p>"Yes, he has hepatitis."

   <p>Dr. Albert Stunkard was chairman of the department of psychiatry at
   the University of Pennsylvania. In September 1971 he had come out to
   work at Stanford Hospital for a year, largely because he wanted to be
   near Suzuki, whom he had studied with in the

   <p>past. Stunkard, one of the senior Zen practitioners in the States, had
   started his study when he was a doctor to Japanese prisoners being
   tried for war crimes in Tokyo in 1946. One of them had told him about
   D. T. Suzuki. He met the great scholar and subsequently became his
   student and occasional doctor. Stunkard had studied with Nakagawa,
   Yasutani, and other teachers as well. He met Shunryu Suzuki for the
   first time at Sokoji in 1967, and Suzuki embarrassed him by asking him
   to deliver the lecture for that evening.

   <p>Entering Suzuki's bedroom, Stunkard saw that Suzuki was scratching. A
   chill went down Stunkard's spine. He knew there were two types of
   jaundiceone infectious (hepatitis), the other obstructive. An
   obstruction to the outflow of bile causes itching. The obstruction
   couldnt be gallstones because Suzuki's gall bladder had been removed.
   Stunkard felt terrible but didn't say anything at the time. He just
   asked if he could confer with Suzuki's doctor.


   <p>If you were not born in this world, there would be no need to die.

   <p>To be born in this world is to die, to disappear [laughing].


   <p>On October 10, 1971, Shunryu Suzuki called his Bay Area disciples
   together. They were asked to wear their robes. At ten o'clock they
   entered the apartment and gathered around his bed, joining his team of
   caregiversRyuho sitting on the floor, Okusan by the door, looking
   tired, and Yvonne at the bedside fussing with Suzuki over an office
   cassette recorder. Mel had driven in from Berkeley and Bill from Mill
   Valley. Also present were Silas, Reb, Lew, and Angie, all of whom
   lived in the building. Claude came from his home in San Francisco.
   Everyone was quiet. There was a feeling of tense anticipation.

   <p>Suzuki sat up in bed, propped up by pillows. He was frail and thin,
   and his skin had become a darker yellow, but his spirits were good. He
   smiled warmly, glad to be with so many of his closest students. He
   hadn't seen them much in the past six weeks. They re-turned his smiles and stood in a semicircle around his bed. On Page
   Street cars passed, and birds chirped in the rubber tree outside the
   window.

   <p>Suzuki cleared his throat and turned on the tape recorder. Then he
   softly told them what they feared to hear.

   <p>As you know, my doctor thought I had hepatitis, but my symptoms didn't
   change for such a long time, so he thought it might not be hepatitis,
   maybe cancer. So I went into Mt. Zion Hospital again three days ago
   and they checked me outand the doctors discussed my illness. The day
   before yesterday my doctor came and told me, "You have cancer." And he
   explained exactly what is happening. So now I am telling you.

   <p>Suzuki immediately set about putting people at ease and giving a
   positive spin to the news. He spoke as if it were no big deal, adding
   that it was a great relief to find out that he had cancer and not
   hepatitis, because now he could eat and drink whatever he wanted, and
   they could share food with him without worrying about contagion.

   <p>I myself selfishly feel good, but on the other hand, I am very sorry
   for you. But I think buddha will take care of everything, so I won't
   worry too much. How long I'll live I don't know. No one knows
   actually. I asked the doctor, "Two years?" "At most," he said. I am
   not so sure about it. So I want you to be prepared. If I live longer,
   it is better, of course, for me and for you. I think I can live one
   more year for sure, I feel that way. I don't feel so discouraged or
   weak. So maybe I want you to allow me to be a lazy monk, that's all. I
   shall be a very bad example, but [laughing] instead, you should be a
   good example. Okay? That's all that I want you to doto prepare. Most
   things you can decide among yourselves. If necessary, I can join your
   discussions. Physically, I get tired quite easily. Thank you very
   much.

   <p>Abruptly he turned to Claude, the oldest, whose counsel he had valued
   since they first met in 1963. "Claude, I want you to stay here, even
   though I am no more. Okay? Please." Claude, cornered, affirmed that he
   would. "Thank you," Suzuki said, going on to make

   <p>a point about their roles as priests and about the priest's
   responsibility within the larger Buddhist community. "You shouldn't
   feel you have to do exactly what I did, you know. You are free to
   develop our way as people want you to do. That is the bodhisattva
   idea."

   <p>He leaned close to the mike when he said this. He was speaking to
   Richard Baker, for whom the tape was being made. Suzuki's tone of
   voice said, you should come back now and assume this responsibility.
   Richard and Suzuki had been corresponding with Yvonne's assistance
   throughout his stay in Japan. Since the spring there had been
   discussion of Richard's returning in the fall or winter to assume some
   of Suzuki's responsibilities. Richard had been resistant to the ideahe
   didn't feel ready for that. Now Suzuki was twisting his arm.

   <p>After some joking with his disciples, Suzuki had the tape rewound and
   played. At the exchange with Claude he listened carefully, stopped the
   machine, and acted pleased that Claude was on tape saying he would
   stay, although his answer was fairly inaudible. Suzuki bowed to his
   crestfallen disciples and they bowed back, going out with tears in
   their eyes to share the tragic news with the community.


   <p>The day before, when Yvonne had gone to the hospital to pick up
   Suzuki, she'd found him sitting on the edge of his bed with legs
   dangling below his hospital gown. Okusan was in the hall saying
   goodbye to some visitors. The nurse had just brought his lunch, and he
   patted the bed and motioned to Yvonne to come over. She knew something
   was up. He slowly mouthed the words, "I have cancer," with a big grin
   on his face. She was confused because the two things didn't go
   togethercancer and grinning. As she sat next to him, he pulled over
   the food tray. "I have cancer. That means we can eat together again."
   He took a forkful from his plate and fed it to her. Yvonne threw her
   arms around him and cried.

   <p>"This cancer is my friend, and my practice will be to take care of
   this sickness," he told her.



   <p>Dr. Stunkard, who had first realized Suzuki had cancer, talked to him
   about going to the cutting-edge Stanford cancer unit, but Suzuki
   decided against it, saying, "This doctor is my doctor, and I have to
   respect him. It wouldn't be appropriate to see another doctor."
   Stunkard tried to tell him things were different in America, but
   Suzuki stood firm. After talking further with his colleagues at
   Stanford, Stunkard decided that Suzuki had made the right decision.
   The type of cancer he had was not responsive to treatment, it had
   spread, and radiation and chemotherapy would just make him sicker.

   <p>"You know we often talked about teaching in the past," Suzuki said to
   Stunkard. "So many of these young people are afraid of dying. I can
   show them that you don't need to be afraid of dying. It's a wonderful
   teaching opportunity."

   <p>"I wish you were doing some other kind of teaching," Stunkard said.

   <p>"Yes, I don't want to die. I don't know what it's going to be like
   when I die. Nobody knows what that's going to be like. But when I die,
   I'll still be a buddha. I may be a buddha in agony, or I may be a
   buddha in bliss, but I'll die knowing that this is how it is."


    <p>Wherever you go you will find your teacher, as long as

   you have the eyes to see and the ears to hear.


   <p>Ryuho continued to do shiatsu on Suzuki every day. He concentrated on
   points in Suzuki's back that corresponded to the liver. He pressed his
   feet and legs and arms. Suzuki was weak but alert. If Ryuho's mind
   wandered while working, Suzuki would immediately tell him to
   concentrate.

   <p>Ryuho was intrigued by the people who came to see Suzuki: disciples,
   students, friends, scholars, artists, teachers, priests, members of
   the Japanese congregation at Sokoji, other Buddhist teach-

   <p>ers. There was Maezumi, the teacher of the L.A. Zen Center, who'd
   known Suzuki since 1959, and Bishop Sumi from Zenshuji in L.A. Eido
   Shimano, Nakagawa's disciple and the teacher at the Zen Studies
   Society in New York, dropped by to pay his respects one day.

   <p>Bob Halpern visited. He had been studying with the Tibetan teacher,
   Trungpa, in Boulder. On Suzuki's bedside table was a large postcard
   Bob had sent. Instead of a note, he had drawn a picture of Trungpa's
   altar, which had a Buddha in the center, Trungpa's Tibetan guru on the
   left, and Suzuki-roshi on the right. Trungpa came a few days later.
   Suzuki spoke to him optimistically about the future of Buddhism in
   America. Trungpa sat by Suzuki's bed, holding his hand for over an
   hour.

   <p>Almost every day some old-timer would enter Suzuki's room and stay for
   half an hourBetty, Della, Jean, Mike Dixon, and others. Suzuki had
   asked Philip to come as much as possible, and he would drive in every
   few days from Santa Rosa. Okusan told Philip that Suzuki said to let
   him in any time he came. Philip said he'd break down the door if he
   couldn't get in.

   <p>Grahame sent a letter from Tokyo expressing concern and saying that
   he'd come as soon as he could, in late December, when he would be
   visiting Pauline and the children in Mill Valley. He was fully
   involved with the English language school he had started and could not
   get away until then.

   <p>Ryuho stood by and listened as Alan Watts and Jano paid their
   respects. He couldn't understand what they were saying, but it was a
   lively meeting, considering Suzuki's condition. Watts was in fine
   form. Jano teased her husband, and Ryuho worried that Suzuki would die
   on the spot, he was laughing so hard.


   <p>Louise brought her newborn daughter to visit wearing a tiny rakusu,
   the last that Suzuki had inscribed. The little one's name was Johanna.
   Suzuki was sitting on a low table in the tatami room. In front of him
   was his well-worn pocket-sized dictionary, brought from Japan and
   often carried back and forth between Tassajara and the city. He picked
   it up and said, "This will live longer than I will."


   <p>Suzuki expressed great regret over his cancer. "Before my disciples
   are ready to come out of the oven, I will be going into it." Louise
   was surprised at his sadness, because she still had the idea that a
   Zen teacher wouldn't have that kind of feeling.


   <p>Suzuki told Bill Kwong the opposite, saying: "I've put my cookies in
   the oven, they've come out fine, and now I'm going to crawl in." He'd
   say different things at different times, but clearly he was thinking
   about his disciples and what to do for them before he died.

   <p>Richard Baker was coming back. There was going to be a ceremony to
   make him the new abbot. Page Street and Tassajara were abuzz with talk
   about it. How could this be? He'd received transmission, but still,
   how could he take on Suzuki's role? What about Katagiri? What about
   the other priests? What about Bill Kwong, who'd been with Suzuki
   almost from the first and who had a zendo in Mill Valley? What about
   Silas, who was giving lectures, Jean in Carmel Valley, Mel in
   Berkeley, and other disciples?

   <p>Suzuki told Claude that he wanted to give transmission to a number of
   his disciples before he died. Especially, he emphasized, he must
   complete Bill Kwong's transmission ceremony. But there were others. He
   was thinking of giving transmission to six to twelve disciples. He
   wanted to ask Noiri-roshi to come over from Japan to work with these
   students for several months in preparation for the ceremony. Claude
   asked what would be the difference between Richard's transmission and
   these, and Suzuki said, "They will be the same as Richard'sno
   difference."

   <p>Claude conferred with a few people, and they all agreed that Suzuki
   was too ill to do this. Okusan was also opposed to her husband's plan.
   Noiri needed a special diet, and she'd have to take care of them both,
   which would be too much for her. Suzuki made it clear how much he
   wanted to do it, but Okusan told him to leave it to Richard, who was
   coming back and could carry out Suzuki's wishes. She and Claude
   agreed; and after they told Suzuki how they felt, he gave up and
   didn't mention it againnot even to Richard.



   <p>Suzuki asked Okusan to go back to Japan after he'd passed his
   authority to Richard in the Mountain Seat Ceremony. He said he wanted
   to do saitokudo, reordination. She knew that he wanted to spend the
   remaining time with his students and to let them take care of him, to
   be as close to them as possible. He'd read a book Katagiri had given
   him by Kodo Sawaki, with an introduction by Katagiri's second teacher,
   Eko Hashimoto. It stressed that priests should practice celibacy and
   not live with women. It didn't seem very practical to Okusan.

   <p>She said, "I'd comply with your wish if you were getting well, but I
   couldn't possibly leave you in this condition. Who would cook rice
   gruel and other Japanese food for you? You need someone who can
   understand your needs by a single wink."

   <p>She wrote to Hoitsu immediately, and he wrote right back, urging her
   to stay with her husband by all means, or they'd just have to send
   someone else from the family to take care of him. Hoitsu sent a
   similar letter to his father. So Suzuki gave up on that idea too. One
   by one he had to let go of his wishes.

   <p>When he had enough energy to walk down the stairs to the basement,
   Suzuki still went to zazen occasionally. Afterward he couldn't get
   back up. He wanted to make it on his own but couldn't. Sometimes Reb
   and Peter would make a chair out of their arms, and he'd sit and enjoy
   the ride. He made it fun. He was very sweet about such dependence. His
   life was not in his own hands anymore.


   <p>Zen is the practice of all existence with everything elsestars, moon,
   sun, mountains, rivers, animate and inanimate beings. Sometimes the
   pain in our legs practices zazen. Sometimes our sleepy mind practices
   zazen on a black cushion, on a chair, or even in bed.


   <p>Richard Baker returned with Virginia and Sally. As soon as they
   arrived, he went to see Suzuki. Soon Suzuki-roshi would pass to him the enormous responsibility of taking care of Zen
   Center and all the people who came there. He would be the chief
   priest. "I'm so sorry for what I'm about to do to you," Suzuki said to
   him, tears filling his eyes.


   <p>"How could someone with your intuition choose to marry someone as
   difficult as me?" Okusan asked.

   <p>"Because you are ridiculously honest," he said.

   <p>"What should I do when you die?" she asked him.

   <p>"Stay here," he said. "Don't go back at all." He said everyone would
   be happy if she stayed, that her ten years in America would make it
   hard for her to adjust to Rinso-in. But how could she be helpful at
   Zen Center? she wanted to know.

   <p>"You are fair in your dealings with people. It will work out
   naturally."

   <p>"Should I become a nun?"

   <p>"Oh, that would be best."

   <p>"I'm too old for that. Maybe I'll be a monk in my next life."

   <p>That got him laughing, which started him coughing. Okusan helped him
   over onto all fours so she could pound his back. He stopped coughing.
   "You're lucky you have someone to take care of you to the last
   moment," she said in a teasing voice.

   <p>Suzuki raised a hand in a faint gassho. Then he farted loudly. "That's
   for you," he said.


<p>Nirvana is seeing one thing through to the end.


   <p>Knowing that their father could pass away at any time, Suzuki's
   daughter Yasuko and son Hoitsu arrived for the first time in the
   States with godfather Amano, to say their farewells. They were shocked
   to see him so jaundiced and weak. They stood at his bed saying a few
   polite phrases, not knowing what to do. But Suzuki was more open and easygoing than in the old days, and before long
   they were talking comfortably with him and among themselves. Okusan
   was making noodles in the cramped kitchen. Then Philip, a familiar
   face, came to visit.

   <p>At Page Street, and later at Tassajara, his children witnessed with
   amazement what Suzuki had accomplished in his twelve years in the
   States. It was hard for Yasuko and Hoitsu to imagine that their father
   was a dharma teacher with many disciples, and that a book of his
   lectures was selling well. They were impressed that everyone called
   him Roshi and amazed to hear from Americans such enthusiastic praise
   for his lectures. "Mother always said his problem was that he didn't
   know how to lecture about Buddhism, that he didn't express himself
   well enough," Hoitsu said. Their father had hardly ever said anything
   to them about Buddhism, so they didn't even think of him as someone
   with a particularly good understanding of it. But the evidence of his
   effort lay before their eyes.

   <p>Yasuko, Hoitsu, and godfather Amano arrived at Tassajara in time to
   attend Bill Kwong's head monk ceremony, at which Katagiri officiated.
   One after another the American students put their hands in gassho and
   asked the head monk questions about dharma and life. Hoitsu couldn't
   believe what he was seeing and got tearythey were doing the ceremony
   sincerely, spontaneously, and in good form.


   <p>I came up from Tassajara to pay a visit to my dying teacher. Richard
   answered the door. I'd already spent time with Richard at Tassajara,
   so we just greeted each other briefly. "Right now is a good time to
   see Roshi," he told me. Knowing me well, Richard was quite firm about
   the time limit. "Don't spend any longer than five minutes unless
   Suzuki-roshi absolutely insists that you stay longer."

   <p>"Okay, I promise," I told him.

   <p>After I'd put on my robes I went to his room. Okusan led me into the
   bedroom and directed me to a chair next to his bed. Suzuki looked up
   and smiled. We bowed. He looked terrible. With some difficulty he
   pulled himself up and sat on the edge of the bed, close

   <p>to me. Then he slapped his thighs like he'd do to indicate pleasure. I
   just sat there moping. "I feel fine," he said. "I don't feel so
   serious." That was all I needed. "Okay," I said snapping out of it.

   <p>He asked me what I was doing at Tassajara, and I said I was the
   assistant director. He acted impressed. Then he gave me a little
   advice. He said that, as a priest, I should have two specialties, one
   primary and one secondary. My first one, he said, should be to take
   care of guests, something I'd done since Tassajara opened. And the
   second one could possibly be scholarship. His point wasn't to tell me
   what to do. He trusted that my seniors at Zen Center and I would work
   out the details on our own. It didn't matter to him so much what I
   did, I think, but he knew I needed some wholesome activity to be
   engaged in through the years that would both express my true nature
   and keep me out of trouble.

   <p>I was touched by his concern. Here he was wasting away, and all his
   attention was on another, giving me a boost, conspiring with me to the
   end to have faith in myself.

   <p>We talked a while longer and then I said I had to go. "No, no, stay,"
   he said. I remembered what Richard had said, and I also thought Suzuki
   should lie down and rest, so I stood up and bowed. Then he said, "If
   you leave I will be unhappy. If you stay I will be happy." "Okay," I
   said. He asked me if I'd met his family and I said yes, that I'd shown
   them around Tassajara. So he called them all in and we talked and
   visited for half an hour. It was lots of fun, and I completely forgot
   that Suzuki was dying and this was the last time we would meet. I
   don't even remember saying goodbye to him.


   <p>"With these hands I have done many things in my life," Suzuki told
   Hoitsu. "I never imagined all the things I would do with these hands
   in America. Now my work is almost finished. It would be good to go
   back to Japan and die there."

   <p>"Would you like to go back to Japan with me?" Hoitsu asked.

   <p>"I will crawl if necessary," his father answered.

   <p>Hoitsu was surprised to hear his father say that. Since his third year
   in America it had seemed that he would never return. Seeing

   <p>his two eldest children and Amano must have awakened a nostalgia for
   his homeland. The ceremony was a week off. They could bring Suzuki
   back with them right after that. Hoitsu talked to Okusan, Yasuko, and
   Amano; with help from Okusan, he talked to Suzuki's doctor, who said
   Suzuki could do it. Hoitsu went to tell his father.

   <p>"Master, the doctor said you can come back with us."

   <p>Suzuki looked up at Hoitsu and laughed. "Isn't it obvious there's no
   way I could leave here? Can't you people even take a joke?"

   <p>"You were just telling us what we wanted to hear," Hoitsu said.

   <p>"Yes, of course. I will become American soil."


   <p>Yasuko saw her father in a new light in America. Putting a positive
   spin on his misfortune, he told her he'd lived longer than he'd
   expected, that his master So-on had died at the age of fifty-five, he
   was now sixty-seven. The twelve extra years were his time in America.
   (Suzuki's chronological accuracy was sometimes offSo-on actually died
   when he was fifty-seven.) He was thin, soft, and open to her. She'd
   never felt closer to him and was sorry she'd seen so little of him
   since he left Japan. She could finally forgive him for the death of
   her mother and saw his accomplishments in America not only as
   atonement for but as partially motivated by her death.

   <p>She thought of the time in the fifth grade when he'd taken her to
   Shizuoka City and, embarrassed to be seen with him, she'd walked on
   the other side of the street. She didn't feel that gap now.

   <p>"The bond between children and parents is never lost," he told her.


   <p>Godfather Amano felt he had accomplished the purpose of his trip. He
   had seen Suzuki, his temples, his students. He could see that Suzuki
   was going to die. "I'd better go back now," he said. He too had cancer
   and trouble with his bowels; and though he wasn't dying or sick like
   his old friend, it was difficult for him to stay. But Suzuki wanted
   him to witness Richard's Mountain Seat Ceremony.

   <p>"Father," Suzuki said to him, "there is one more important job I need to do as a monk. Please see it and report it to the membership at
   Rinso-in. Tell them what I have done since I left them and came here."

   <p>"Father, please fulfill Hojo's wishes," said Okusan.

   <p>Finally Amano agreed to stay.


   <p>It was more difficult every day for Suzuki to talk, but he could do
   it, especially with Okusan, with whom he could communicate with much
   less effort. "I won't interfere with Zen Center at all once I have
   handed it over to Richard. It's entirely up to him whether it will be
   ruined or not," Suzuki said to his wife. He even told her and Richard
   that he didn't want any more Japanese priests to come to Zen Center as
   teachers. "From now on, they should come as students."


    <p>The most important point is to continue our way

   and to have a good successor.


   <p>On Sunday, November 21, at ten in the morning, the halls and courtyard
   of Zen Center were filled with people talking softly and waiting. They
   had come for the Mountain Seat Ceremony in which Richard Baker was to
   be installed as the chief priest of Zen Center. The foyer and hallway
   were lined with rows of chairs. The buddha hall, where the ceremony
   was to take place, was too small for the five hundred guests. Chinese,
   Tibetan, and Japanese priests of various sects attended with some of
   their disciples. Many of the key figures in Suzuki's life in America
   were there: Wako and Emi Kato, Reverend Ogui, George Hagiwara, and
   many from the Japanese congregation of Sokoji. Bill McNeil stood in a
   corner in a leather jacket; poets and artists from the old Beat days
   came in the front door. So many people who had become deeply connected in the past twelve years, so many stories like fibers
   running among them, so many for whom Suzuki had opened dharma gates or
   been there with a nudge when their lives turned.

   <p>The bell downstairs was being struck every minute, informing the crowd
   that it was time to settle down. People patiently sat or stood where
   they were. They could hear a procession moving from Katagiri's
   apartment up the street, into the building, and to its various altars.
   The rumble of the deep buddha drum echoed in the hallsthe high
   chin-chun! of handheld bells a half-tone apart and the kachin! of
   wooden clackers, the music of the moving rite. On the second floor the
   procession stopped outside Suzuki's room, where Richard offered
   incense and said: "Although I don't know how I came, through your
   heart-teaching I am always here."

   <p>Katagiri-roshi, Kobun-sensei, and a few of Suzuki's senior monks
   accompanied Richard down the stairs to the hushed buddha hall. Richard
   wore a blue and gold robe with bright-colored flying phoenixes, which
   Suzuki had given him for this day. He carried a ceremonial horsehair
   whisk.

   <p>The assembled crowd was utterly hushed when the spine-chilling sound
   of intermittent thuds and jangling bells jolted everyone to attention.
   Suzuki was walking with the staff Alan Watts had given him. Affixed to
   the top was a bronze headpiece with rings. At his sides were Hoitsu
   and Okusan. They helped him down the stairs and past those seated and
   standing along the way, to the double doors of the buddha hall. With
   each step he struck the floor with his staff, as if continuing to
   plant the dharma in America. There he was, his reddish-brown okesa
   draping over a yellow koromo. All eyes were on him. Many people hadn't
   seen him in his illness, and even to those who had, his appearance was
   crushing. He was so dark, weak, and shrunken. Yet as he moved into the
   buddha hall toward the specially built Mountain Seat altar, his
   enormous effort and dignity shone through.

   <p>Reaching the brocade-covered altar, still supported on both sides, he
   slowly pulled out from the sleeve of his robe a bowing cloth.
   Gathering his strength, he laid it out properly, bowed down to the floor, and rose, somehow, drawing strength from the depth of his will,
   calm and powerful, the way frail old Kitano-roshi had risen from his
   bows at Eiheiji, amazing and inspiring the young Suzuki. Hoitsu helped
   him to a cushioned ceremonial chair to the right of the altar. He sat
   and looked with eyes straight ahead yet downcast, as in zazen.

   <p>People were just catching their breath when Richard Baker stepped
   forward. After the Heart Sutra was recited, Richard stood before the
   Mountain Seat altar and said in classical style: "This Mountain Seat,
   climbed many times before, is the everywhere bodhimandala. With the
   help of my Master and everyone here, in the ten directions and the
   three times, I will climb this mind-seal altar. Do not wonder about it
   at all."

   <p>He offered incense to buddhas, bodhisattvas, and ancestors, to Trudy
   Dixon, Katagiri-roshi, and "to my own subtle and compassionate
   teacher, Suzuki Shunryu-daiosho," to whom he said, drawing from
   Suzuki's own Mountain Seat Ceremony at Sokoji in 1962:

   <p>This piece of incense

   <p>Which I have had for a long long time

   <p>I offer with no-hand

   <p>To my Master, to my friend, Suzuki Shunryu-daiosho,

   <p>The founder of these temples.

   <p>There is no measure of what you have done.

   <p>Walking with you in Buddha's gentle rain

   <p>Our robes are soaked through,

   <p>But on the lotus leaves

   <p>Not a drop remains.

   <p>Richard sat on a red lacquered chair before the altar. Katagiri spoke
   for Suzuki loud and clear: "Dragons and Elephants! Accept this holder
   of Buddha's First Seat!"

   <p>Then Richard Baker said, in what may be called the first lecture of
   his abbotship, "There is nothing to be said."

   <p>A mondo followed, ritualized yet impromptu questions, which Richard answered quickly and dramatically. Telegrams were read, formal
   congratulations were made, and the ceremony was over.

   <p>Suzuki was helped to face the altar, where he made another slow,
   painful prostration from which he rose almost by himself. Then he
   started down the aisle to leave. Halfway to the opened doorway he
   stopped in the midst of his sangha, disciples, students, former
   students, admirers, old friends, visiting teachers, and guests. There
   was utter silence. He looked to the left, then decisively rolled the
   staff several times between his hands; the rings at the top burst out
   jangling. He looked to the right and rolled his staff again, and again
   the rings rang out. It was the sound of an ultimate effort. It was the
   sound of his love and his freedom.

   <p>Tears and sobbing began on all sides. Hearts cracked open. Everything
   was suspended in his presence, in an immense shared feelinga car
   honking on the street, pigeons cooing, the crying in the room, and a
   deep stillness. Time stopped. A moment that started the day he arrived
   in America continued as he was helped out of the room, striking his
   staff to the floor as he went. He left behind him a room full of palms
   pressed together saying thank you, saying goodbye, saying what could
   not be said.


   <p>After the ceremony, Suzuki met with his disciples. Twenty or so sat on
   the tatami in his sitting room. It was done. He'd passed on Zen
   Center, Page Street, and Tassajara to Zentatsu Richard Baker, who sat
   next to him a head higher in his fancy robes, his eyes down, the
   weight of what he'd received all over him. Suzuki turned to him,
   nodded, and smiled. The room was hushed. In a faint voice Suzuki said
   thank you to everyone and to Richard and then, nodding toward
   Katagiri, another breathy thank you "for all you've done, for which I
   am so grateful." All of a sudden a howl arose. It was Katagiri who
   crawled toward Suzuki crying out, "Don't die!" Sobbing, he hugged
   frail Suzuki, who said in a soft rasp, "Daijobu. Daijobu" (It's all
   right).



   <p>Katagiri had said goodbye to Suzuki and was on his way back to
   Tassajara for the last few weeks of the practice period. He left in
   sadness and with some discomfort at his situation. Seven years he'd
   served Suzukihard work, low pay, no time off. Katagiri was dependable
   and had a seamless constant practice. He'd come to be seen as a
   coteacher by many. Suzuki and Katagiri had contained their feelings,
   speaking little through the years. Until the meeting with his
   disciples following Richard's Mountain Seat Ceremony, Suzuki had never
   verbally expressed his gratitude.

   <p>Suzuki was still troubled by Katagiri's intention to leave. He wanted
   him to remain a senior dharma teacher for the whole community. "Maybe
   Katagiri can still help," he said to Okusan as he went to sleep.

   <p>Katagiri wasn't the only person he had troubled thoughts about.
   Unfinished business pressed at Suzuki. Bill. Silas. He wanted to take
   care of his disciples. Suzuki's style was to let things happen,
   nudging them, patiently waiting, acting skillfully by not acting
   rashly. He hadn't known how quickly his illness would overcome him.
   Some disciples were disturbed. A few had postponed or given up careers
   to devote themselves to studying with this dying man. Would he leave
   no final instructions?

   <p>So far Suzuki's instructions were not about practical matters but
   about dying with dignity. It was tragic for his students to see the
   deteriorating physical condition of their dear teacher, yet at the
   same time it was marvelous to witness his composure and see how
   undiminished he was at heart.


   <p>In his last meeting with Hoitsu before his son returned to Japan,
   Suzuki implored, "Take care of Bill Kwong for me. Make sure Bill gets
   transmissionyou can do it for me."

   <p>Suzuki wanted Hoitsu to be available to help his disciples in whatever
   way he could, but Hoitsu knew his father didn't want him to interfere
   with Richard. "Leave Zen Center to Richard," he'd said several times.
   Hoitsu also knew that leaders need assistance, and his father knew it
   too. Richard would need help from his elders, like

   <p>Katagiri and Claude, and from his peers, like Bill and Silas. Even if
   he disagreed with them, he should work with and respect them. Suzuki
   knew there was rivalry but hoped it could move toward cooperation. "It
   is done," he said to his son. "All I can do now is hope."

   <p>With the trust he had in Richard and in others, and considering his
   patience and acceptance of problems, Suzuki's hope might have included
   more possibilities than were imagined by his students. If some
   disciples couldn't work together, maybe they could work separately. If
   there were sharp differences, maybe time would smooth the edges.
   Ultimately, if people were sincere, it would be okay. He might have
   looked at his students through his dying eyes and thought, as when
   Tatsugami landed, "You have no idea how much you're going to suffer."


   <p>Amano came to his bedside to say goodbye. "I've finished all my
   duties," Suzuki told him. "Please report the details to the members."

   <p>"Hai," Amano answered in the affirmative.

   <p>Suzuki gave Amano his mala bracelet with the skull-shaped beads. He
   told Okusan to roll up a scroll for Yasuko and to give Hoitsu the
   staff with the bronze rings he'd carried in the ceremony. The clanger
   on top of the staff was the last item he wanted to return to Rinso-in,
   of those he had borrowed when he'd left in 1959.

   <p>"Well, we're leaving now," said Amano.

   <p>"Okay. Goodbye, Father. Have a good trip," Suzuki said softly.

   <p>Hoitsu couldn't believe how casually the two said farewell, as if it
   were just another day.

   <p>Sitting on the plane before takeoff, Yasuko was crying. She wanted to
   get off and stay with her father. Hoitsu told her they had to go back
   now to help Amano explain to people what their father had been doing
   in America these twelve years, what he had created and was leaving
   behind. Nobody had really understood why he left. Now Amano, Yasuko,
   and Hoitsu knew and could tell the others, who should feel some pride
   in this too.





   <p>The ancient bodhisattvas were not afraid of, but found joy in failure,
   poverty, and deathand in doing small things.


   <p>A hospital bed was put in a second-floor room overlooking the
   courtyard. There Suzuki could have a sense of the rhythm of the
   building and some time in the sunlight. The buddha hall was right
   below; during morning service he'd listen to the sounds of chanting,
   drums, and bells coming through the window and the open door. Okusan
   would wash his face, and he'd have a glass of orange juicethat was his
   service. He was too weak to get out of bed.

   <p>Ryuho would get lost looking at Suzuki's face as he gave him shiatsu
   treatments. It was spacy and changing, he said, and it didn't look
   Japanese. He could obviously die at any timeOkusan and the doctor said
   so, too. His skin was dark, almost the color of the brown okesa robe.
   But to Ryuho the light of his eyes was powerful.

   <p>Yvonne was there every day, staying with him while Okusan cooked, did
   laundry, and cleaned. They took turns caring for him and massaging his
   back, legs, armswherever he'd indicate. Yvonne would be sitting by his
   bed and a skinny arm would come out from the covers and go into the
   air. She'd rub it for a while; then he'd pull it back under the
   covers. Later the other arm would appear. She and Okusan massaged and
   moved him enough so that he hadn't gotten any bedsores. He never
   complained and always appreciated the attention he received.

   <p>There was a bottle of painkillers on the table. He refused them, as
   after the gallbladder operation. He had tried them once because his
   doctor told him to, but he didn't like the state of mind that
   resulted, so he asked Yvonne to take them away. Still, he told Richard
   that sometimes he felt like he was being tortured.

   <p>One day Suzuki asked Yvonne to come close to him, and when she did he apologized for not having ordained her as a priest, saying
   again that he lacked confidence in training women. "I didn't recognize
   your seriousness to practice," he said.


   <p>Suzuki asked Yvonne about Silas and was pained to hear that he had
   already left to lead sesshins in Portland and Quadra Island near
   Vancouver. Silas had come to say goodbye, but Suzuki had been
   sleeping. He sat next to him for a while and then left. Silas did not
   see eye to eye with Richard and had argued that the membership should
   have had a chance to approve of Richard as the new abbot. But most
   people just wanted to do what Suzuki wanted. The board members were
   all students and couldn't accept Silas's democratic and legal
   approach. He hadn't seen much of Suzuki since Richard returned. Now
   Suzuki was thinking about Silas.


   <p>Within a week of the ceremony, Suzuki had almost completely stopped
   talking. Then he stopped eating. His body was soft and weak and thin,
   the size of an eight-year-old child. It had always had a childlike
   quality, but with great strength and energy, the power to move large
   stones. Now it was a dark, dying child's body. Okusan told Ryuho not
   to bother coming anymore. Either Okusan or Yvonne stayed close by.
   They still massaged him gently, but to Yvonne it seemed that mainly
   they were just breathing together. She felt there was almost nothing
   they needed to do. Just leave him alone, be with him, and respond to
   his few requests. They wiped his face. When he stopped drinking, they
   kept his lips and mouth moist with a washcloth.


   <p>Richard came every day. Sometimes he would talk to Suzuki with
   Okusan's help. She said he could hardly hear now. "Where will I meet
   you?" Richard asked, standing in gassho at the foot of the bed.
   Suzuki's hands came out from under the covers in gassho. Then, with
   index finger extended, he drew a circle in the air, bowed into it, and
   returned his hands under the covers. Richard bowed in return.





   <p>That we are here means we will vanish.


   <p>On the evening of December 3, Suzuki was moved from the hospital bed
   overlooking the courtyard to his own bed in his apartment. "Tomorrow,"
   he told Okusan in a hoarse whisper, "I must talk to Richard about
   Silas."

   <p>Okusan went into the tatami room and spread out the futon. For the
   first time she didn't put on her pajamas, but left her clothes on and
   lay down exhausted to sleep.

   <p>Suzuki's son Otohiro had been there for a couple of days and said he
   would stay till the end, which he knew was near. He slept on Okusan's
   bed, up against his father's in the small room. At about two in the
   morning Otohiro shook Okusan awake. "Mother! Mother! Father wants a
   bath."

   <p>"No no no." She went in and told her husband to go back to sleep. He
   repeated that he wanted a bath. The thought of it made Okusan anxious.
   He hadn't been in a tub for a long time.

   <p>"It's okay," he said.

   <p>Otohiro wasn't going to argue. He knew the old man would be stubborn
   to the end. Okusan went into the bathroom and started to fill the tub.
   Otohiro carried him into the bathroom slowly and placed him in the
   tub. Suzuki started gasping for air, breathing fast. "It's all over,"
   he said between short breaths.

   <p>"Calm down, calm down," Otohiro spoke soothingly in his ear holding
   him. "Breathe slowly, breathe slowly." Otohiro breathed loudly and
   slowly, and his father's breath slowed down till they were both
   breathing together at the same slow rate.

   <p>Suzuki asked for the bar of scented soap that Della had given him. He
   never used anything scented, but he took it and slowly made a good
   lather, and they helped him to clean himself thoroughly. Then he took
   a long, relaxed bath.

   <p>Afterward Suzuki lay on the bed and sighed. Slowly and faintly he
   spoke. "Ahhhh, what a good feeling," he said, with a wisp of pleasure
   on his face. "Don't wake me in the morning."

   <p>"Maybe you're thirsty," said Okusan. "Would you like some orange juice
   or ice cream?"

   <p>"Orange juice." He drank some orange juice, closed his eyes, and went
   to sleep.

   <p>Okusan went back to her futon and Otohiro lay down next to his father
   in the bed. Before long it was four and he heard the wake-up bella
   handbell run through the halls to get people up for zazen. It was not
   just any day's zazen, but December 4, the first day of a five-day
   sesshin that would culminate on Buddha's Enlightenment Day, the eighth
   of December. Over a hundred people were participating. Otohiro could
   hear people opening and closing doors carefully, running water in the
   bathroom across the hall. Then came the sharp sound of the wooden han
   being hit, indicating that the new abbot, Zentatsu Baker-roshi (as
   Suzuki said to call him), was on his way to offer incense at various
   altars. The last altar was the one in the zendo, where he would open
   the sesshin and begin the first period of zazen.

   <p>The sound of a bell could be heard faintly coming from the distant
   zendo. Otohiro felt his father move slightly. Suzuki's hand reached
   over and clutched his arm.

   <p>"Get Baker," came a thin whisper.

   <p>Otohiro jumped out of bed and ran into the tatami room. "Mother!
   Something's happening with father! He said to get Baker!"

   <p>Without a word Okusan leapt up and went quickly down to the zendo.

   <p>Richard had just sat down on his cushion and straightened his robes
   when Okusan opened the side door. Lew was sitting in the space nearest
   her. "Get Zentatsu!" she whispered urgently.

   <p>Richard took long strides to the zendo door and then dashed up the
   stairway to Suzuki's room. Okusan and Otohiro left Suzuki alone with
   Richard. He was still conscious, and with the last strength of his life he just barely reached his hand out to his
   beloved disciple. Half sitting, half kneeling by the bed, Richard held
   his hand and touched his forehead to Suzuki's. They rested that way
   for a few moments, then Richard felt the man most dear to him slip
   away, let go of his life. Slowly, Shunryu Suzuki-roshi faded awayso
   gently that Richard could not tell when he died; he just knew it had
   happened.

   <p>Richard let go of Suzuki's hand. He waited a moment and felt for a
   pulse. Then he went outside to Okusan and Otohiro. Richard had his
   hand on his heart. He spoke in Japanese, his voice cracking, as he
   told them, "Suzuki-roshi's life has ended."
