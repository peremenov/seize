<h>Task Force on Child Domestic Workers

    <p>The Child Workers in Asia Task Force on Child Domestic Workers is a
     regional Task Force with members from both the South and Southeast
    Asia sub-regions. It serves as a reference group for the network on
      strategies to address problems of child domestic workers in the
    region. Under the leadership of Visayan Forum Foundation as Convenor
   since its inception in 1996, it and its members have had an impressive
   record of advocating for greater visibility and treatment of the issue
       in the region. It is a regular collaborator with ILO-IPEC and
     Anti-Slavery International and has worked with these organizations
   extensively on experience sharing, research, and advocacy initiatives.

    <p>In its efforts to address and raise awareness of the issues relating
       to child domestic workers the Task Force has set the following
                         priorities for 2002-2005:

      <l>1. Research and policy framework, including the development and
                        promotion of good practices.

     <l>2. Documentation and sharing of information, especially through a
                          website and a circular.

   <l>3. Advocacy on the development and enforcement of standards (including
    legislation), working with employers, with a focus on education and
                            child participation.

   <l>4. Capacity building of existing and new Task Force members, including
               child domestic workers and their associations.

      <l>5. Networking and linkaging towards influencing institutions at
               national, regional, and international levels.

     <l>6. Strengthening and linking, developing programs, and generating
       attention and action towards attacking the connection between
   trafficking and children as well as adults' entry into domestic work.

    <p> Its activities focus on the collection and focus of field experience
   and strategies and capacity building and delivery of these experiences
                               for advocacy.

                <h>Regional Consultations and Field Exchanges 

    <p>The 1st Regional Consultation on Child Domestic Workers was held in
    1997 and was the first coordinated activity of the Task Force. This
    was followed by a field exchange in 1997 in Bangladesh sponsored by
                                 Shoishab.

       <p>This pattern of holding a consultation to share and enrich the
   experience of field workers followed by a field exchange to serve as a
   venue for exchange of program strategies and building cooperation was
        continued with the 2nd Regional Consultation in 2002 in the
   Philippines and the 2nd Regional Field Exchange later in the same year
                 sponsored by the Visayan Forum Foundation.

   <p>A third series of field exchanges will be held for South and Southeast
    Asia in partnership with Anti-Slavery International. The South Asia
   field exchange will be hosted by Arunodhaya and the National Domestic
    Workers Movement in Chennai, India in June 2006. The Southeast Asia
        field exchange was hosted by Visayan Forum Foundation in the
                       Philippines in November 2005.

                      <h>Manual for Sustainable Advocacy

     <p>In 2003, the Task Force co-organised a workshop for Southeast Asia
     Capacity Building Towards Sustainable Advocacy for Child Domestic
     Workers. This workshop resulted in a plan to develop a Manual for
     Sustainable Advocacy for Child Domestic Workers. After a series of
   design and planning meetings, development of this manual is currently
   underway with the University of the Philippines Center for Integrative
   & Development Studies Psychosocial Trauma and Human Rights Program (UP
       CIDS PST) and with support from ILO-IPEC. The draft manual was
      validated with member and other organisation working with child
                    domestic workers in September 2005.

   <p>The manual, Raising One Voice: A Training Manual for Advocates on the
      Rights of Child Domestic Workers, was published in February 2006

   <p>The manual is meant to be a teaching tool and practical training guide
   that combines both the theoretical aspects of advocacy that considers
      the particularities of child domestic work in Southeast Asia and
   involving children in the action. While the manual will mainly be used
    to train trainers in Asian countries, itl also draws good practices
   and lessons learned in other regions especially Africa, Latin America
                                and Pacific.

                  <h>International Workshop for Practitioners

      <p>In 2004, the Task Force Convenor and Anti-Slavery International
       organized an International Workshop for Practitioners on Child
   Domestic Labour for organizations having direct experience in working
      with child domestic workers. The objective of the meeting was to
    document and share good practices in intervention and to facilitate
         information and experience sharing among the participants.

     <p>As input to the workshop, consultations were held with former and
      current child domestic workers in nine countries and Task Force
     members took the lead in conducting these consultations in Nepal,
              India (Chennai), the Philippines, and Sri Lanka.

        <p>Based on the outcomes of the workshop and the consultation.
    Anti-Slavery International published a handbook on good practice in
   programme interventions in which the work of the Task Force members is
                                 featured.
