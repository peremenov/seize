   <p>Lid units are made of the same genuine hardwoods. We offer two mitered
   styles; a framed acylic glass model that allows a viewing access to
   the interior and a solid top model that affords added strength as well
   as privacy for your gun or knife. All framed lids are 3/4" thick
   hardwoods using either (a) 1/8" acrylic glass or (b) 1/4" Walnut or
   Oak panels with matching velvet interior. Solid brass hinges attach
   lid units to lower boxes.
   <p>Interiors are custom cut and fitted to your handgun or knife. (We only
   require an outline on paper of the object the case is for. This is
   supplied by the customer and elimates any need for the real item to be
   sent to us). Details of the outlining process are described on this
   page. [Close up with green velvet interior]

                                        <h>Close up of green velvet interior

   

   <p>Our case interiors are made of durable Red or Dark Green velvet
   covering a one inch layer of dense construction foam that has been cut
   out to contour fit your item not only in outline, but also for depth.
   A typicial interior allows approximately one half of the gun or knife
   to be in the cut out area. We use the old style of uncut velvet
   contour fitting to fill the recess with no seams. This is very long
   lasting, and leaves no places for seperation. This style of interior
   results in a very pleasing "wrinkled" effect which is very common in
   many antique dueling pistol cases.

<h>Outlining Process

   <p>Please follow the very simple guidelines to ensure a good fit of all
   objects intended for your Custom Case.
   <p>The only tools needed are a soft lead pencil, a ruler and typewriter
   paper. If your handgun or knife are longer than an 8 1/2" X 11"
   standard paper, tape two sheets together and outline on both.
   Looking straignt down at the object, guide the pencil around the
   contours or profile as close to the actual size as possible. We cannot
   stress the importance of the actual size drawing. We will make the
   compartments slightly larger than the outline to allow ease in removal
   of the handgun, knife or accessory.
   
   <p>The interior velvet area is approx. 1 inch thick. Give us the
   thickness dimensions of the depth of the objects by writing them on
   their individual outlines (as shown). Remember, objects that are
   thicker than 2 1/4 inches will not fit in the basic case. Larger items
   will require a deeper case, which will be slightly higher in price.
   The key is to Take Your Time with the outline process. Have plenty of
   good lighting. Make each ojects' outline as close to ACTUAL SIZE as
   possible. Remember to include the depth dimensions on each drawing.
   Send actual outlines to us in a LETTER. Fax machines can enlarge or
   reduce important outlines without warning. Please include your NAME,
   address and phone number on the back of EACH outline and what objects
   they represent.



   <p>Unlike others, we do not import our products. We start with roughsawn
   quality American hardwoods and convert them into beautiful, long
   lasting products that will be in use for generations. We keep our
   cases simple in design, permitting the eye to focus on the contents,
   not the case. This allows us to pass the savings on to our customer.
   We try very hard to keep our fixed option products in stock (Memorial
   Flag Display Cases, Kabar cases & stands, etc.) Our Medal/Flag cases,
   Handgun & Knife Cases and Civil War Chests are completed to comply
   with the individual customer's own interior color choices or requests.
   Due to the custom nature and popularity of our products, shipping
   times may vary from 1 to 4 weeks. An estimated time of shipping will
   be given when an order is received. We will do our best to ship as
   quickly as possible without comprimising the quality of our products.
