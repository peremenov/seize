                     <h>What is meant by "Prohibitionist"?


   <p>From a Usenet thread



   <p>Like many libertarians and their fellow-travelers, I use the word
   "prohibitionist" as a term of abuse, as in "Gun Prohibitionist," "Drug
   Prohibitionist," or "Alcohol Prohibitionist." In each case,
   prohibition creates more problems than it solves.

   <p>But where does one draw the line? Would one sneer at an "H-bomb
   prohibitionist" for outlawing backyard H-bombs?

   <p>As a draft, I offer the following--

   <p>"Prohibitionist" --

   <l>1. (public impact) someone who would respond to a minority's misuse of
   a product or right by denying that product or right to the majority
   who use it responsibly.

   <l>2. (private impact) someone who would employ the coercive power of the
   government against private, non-criminal behavior. (Behavior can be
   "criminal" only if it harms or unreasonably endangers another person
   without that person's informed consent.)

   <p>Comments--

   <p>I have to use two separate definitions, because the issues raised by
       drug prohibition and gun prohibition differ somewhat.
       <p>Alcohol-- Highly destructive to 10% of users, mildly beneficial
       (1/2 glass of wine a day reduces heart attacks) to the other 90%.
       Pleasurable. An Alcohol Prohibitionist would meet both definition
       #1 and #2.
       <p>Marijuana-- Similar to alcohol, except that destructive effects to
       minority are far milder. Medical benefits accrue only to small
       number of users. Pleasurable. A marijuana prohibitionist would
       meet both definition #1 and #2.
       <p>Heroin-- Benefits to majority of users are questionable. A heroin
       Prohibitionist would only meet definition #2.
       <p>Guns-- highly destructive to public in hands of criminal minority.
       Beneficial to public in hands of honest majority, discouraging
       home invasions, assaults on women, and massacres. Pleasurable to
       some hunters. A Gun Prohibitionist would only meet definition #1.
       <p>Backyard H-bombs-- highly destructive to public in criminal hands.
       There is no private "responsible use" that could not be met far
       more safely by guns. Neither definition #1 nor #2 would apply to
       opponents of private possession.

   <p>My post provoked some comment from the talk.politics.drugs newsgroup,
   but not from talk.politics.guns


       <p>Nice definition. One comment on the comments. In the definition #1
       you talk of responsible use vs misuse, yet in the comments you
       talk of benefits and destructiveness. In what way does the lack of
       heroin's benefits preclude the possibility of its being used
       responsibly? (note: I am not saying that I know any 'responsible'
       heroin addicts. I don't, but that doesn't mean they don't exist.)
       The medical benefits of alcohol or pot certainly don't preclude
       them from being used irresponsibly. Is it possible to use tobacco
       responsibly?
       <p>Not ragging, just poking.
       <p>--N_J
      
       <p>You raise valid objections. My terminology and discussion of the
       examples was arbitrary and oversimplified.
       When talking about "misuse" and "responsible use", I had in mind
       impact on society (eg with gun ownership). But, you are right --
       according to the dictionary, one can refer to "responsible" use of
       a recreational option that has no effect on others, only on
       oneself.
       <p>Heroin-- Even it has legitimate uses as a painkiller, especially
       in some cancer cases. And many of the same prohibitionists who
       fiercely prosecute doctors inclined to prescribe it (and other
       effective pain-killers) are among those most self-righteously
       opposed to physician-assisted suicide for those with intractable
       pain.
       <p>I confess I don't know the details about heroin's effect on most
       users, whether there is a "slippery slope" of addiction leading
       inexorably to larger doses and physiological harm, or whether, in
       a maintenance environment, its effects are stabilized and the user
       can have a perfectly happy and productive life.
       <p>Tobacco-- Yes, it is often used "responsibly" to raise work
       productivity. For example, a friend of mine was a naval officer.
       Whenever he went to sea, with the usual schedule that only allows
       about 3 hours of sleep per day, he would take up smoking as the
       best way to avoid falling asleep at the job. Whenever his tour of
       sea duty ended, however, he would quit when he came home to his
       family, all non-smokers.
       <p>I would not use the word "responsible" for actuaries who would
       balance US "Social Security" pension accounts by encouraging more
       smoking, but others might legitimately tax me with overly
       squeamish "political correctness."

       <p>When heroin was legal there were a great many responsible heroin
       addicts. One of the founders of Johns Hopkins was a heroin addict
       - he used it in pill form - and the addiction seems to have had no
       effect on his ability to be a productive member of society; even
       his wife never noticed. Heroin is an extremely potent cough
       suppressant and also an extremely potent pain reliever. The name
       "Heroin" was originally the brand name under which it was marketed
       as a cough suppressant by the Bayer corporation.
       <p>The chief negative effect of long-term heroin use is constipation.
       It's actually a very safe drug if you can get a regular supply and
       take it in pill form, which is what addicts and responsible users
       would be likely to do if it were cheap and legal. The health
       dangers of being a heroin addict today are almost entirely caused
       by the drug's legal status. These are dangers associated with
       shooting up, with not knowing the purity of the drug, with not
       having access to clean needles, and with not having consistent
       access to the drug.
       <p>My sources for all of the above are: <l>(1) _Licit and Illicit Drugs_
       by the editors of Consumer Reports, and <l>(2) the Encyclopedia
       Britannica.
