   <h>Toy Train Ride to Darjeeling

                                 

   <p>The Darjeeling Himalayan Railway is lovingly called the "Toy Train".
   The Toy Train ride is a romantic approach to the Himalayas, a
   mysterious region. The landscape can only be described as spectacular
   and the views of the Himalayan peaks breathtaking. The Darjeeling Toy
   Train is one of the most famous narrow (2 feet ) gauge trains. 
   

   <p>This joy ride begins at New Jalpaiguri, a busy railway station in the
   plains. The plains are much more warmer than the hills and as the
   train climbs up the mountains the climate gets much colder. Therefore
   it is advisable to keep warm clothes handy as one needs them. Leaving
   New Jalpaiguri station the train passes through the outskirts of
   Siliguri town and reaches Siliguri station. After a short halt the
   train leaves Siliguri station and crosses the Mahanadi bridge over the
   Mahanadi river which flows from the Himalayan foothills. 

   <p>After six miles train reaches Sukna station from where the real ascent
   begins. Here the train normally stops for the engine to take water.
   The traveller can now notice the change of local people who have sharp
   mongoloid features and are mostly Nepali. From here the blue mountain
   ranges of the foothills are visible and the train quickly rises from
   the plain passing through tea gardens and forest of teak and sal. 

   
   <p>The train now passes through Rangtang station (1404 ft/430 m) and a
   little further away the train may stop for water again. From here the
   view of wooded mountains is really beautiful. The train moves on with
   the view of tea gardens, tea factories and forests. It then passes
   Chunbhati. Before the railway line was built, there was a bungalow
   here where the travellers travelling in palki (palanquin) used to rest
   for the day. The train is now fairly among the mountains and a
   panoramic view of the deep valley and higher range of mountains is
   visible. Then the train passes the Tindharia Railway workshop to reach
   Tindharia station (2,822 feet/860m).

   
   <p>Tindharia, in the old times, was the spot where travellers used to
   stop for tea. From here one can get an extensive view of the hills.
   Leaving Tindharia one can see the jagged rock-faced mountains up ahead
   called Giddapahar (Eagle's Craig) which the train later has to pass
   through. Using "zig-zag reverses" the train leaves Gayabari station
   (3,400 feet/1040m).

   <p>After this station the train stops for water near Pagla Jhora (Mad
   Torrent). During the monsoon this small stream swells up and is big
   enough to wash away the road and railway line. Shortly after this the
   train reaches Mahanadi Bazar station (4,000 ft/1,225m). Just near this
   town is the source of the Mahanadi river which the train had earlier
   crossed shortly after leaving Siliguri. Leaving Mahanadi the train
   travels west through Gidhapahar (Eagle's Craig) with an excellent view
   of the valley, the hills and tea gardens and reaches Kurseong station
   (4,864 feet/1485m). 

   <p>Kurseong is a thriving little hill station. Here one can get the first
   glimpse of a hill town and the hill people. Leaving Kurseong the train
   passes through Kurseong bazar and goes on in its journey. The sight of
   Tibetan prayer flags as the train passes over Hussel (whistle) khola
   (stream) makes the traveller feel that he is now truly in the
   mountains. The train passes through small forests of maple, chestnut,
   pear, cherry, criptomeria (introduced from Japan), etc. and cardamom
   plants.

   <p>Now the train reaches Tung (5656 ft/1725m) which gives us an excellent
   view of the Kurseong ridge. As the train passes along the road, one
   may notice by now that through the journey from New Jalpaiguri to
   Darjeeling there are over 100 road crossings and most of the time the
   train runs along parallel with the cars and other vehicles. 

    

   <p>The journey new leads through Sonada (6552 ft. /2000m). As the train
   passes through Sonada bazar, one can get a glimpse of Tibetan chorten
   (stupa) on the way. Now the train passes through Senchel Reserve
   forest with oaks, chestnuts, walnuts, magnolias, rhododendrons, etc.
   During spring one can see the bright blooms of rhododendrons, cream
   magnolias and orchids in this moss-laden forest. On top of this hill
   is a famous tourist spot Tiger Hill with a unique view of the
   Himalayas and also of the sunrise. This forest region is well known
   worldwide for bird-watching.

   <p>The train now passes through a small town called Jorebunglow. The road
   here is very narrow and often there are traffic jams since all the
   traffic in and out of Darjeeling pass this point. This must be the
   only place where the train may have to stop for a while in case of a
   traffic jam or have to back up a bit to ease the traffic. The train
   now reaches Ghoom (7407 ft/2260 m) the highest point of the journey. 

                          
   <p>Leaving Ghoom the train descends towards Darjeeling. On the way the
   train passes through Batasia Loop with its memorial to the Gorkha
   soldiers. From the Batasia Loop you can get a spectacular view of
   Darjeeling town with the Kanchenjunga and other snowy mountains in the
   back-drop. From now onwards uptill Darjeeling, the snowy peaks are in
   full view for the travellers' eyes. Finally the train enters the
   Darjeelins Station, the destination of the journey. Darjeeling, a town
   with all its charm and beauty awaits the weary traveller.

                         <h>SPECIAL TOY TRAIN JOY RIDE
   <p>During Tourist seasons, that is, March to May and October to December,
    special Toy Train Joy Ride is arranged from Darjeeling to Ghoom and
                                   back.
