   <p>DictatorMao's Review: Sony Handycam CCD-TRV308 Hi-8 Analog Camcorder
   provided by Epinions.com
   
   <p>Pros: Night Vision (0 Lux), Steady Shot, Halogen Lamp, 460X zoom,
   Affordable
   <p>Cons: Not Digital, Capacity of Included Battery, Sony batteries
   devastatingly expensive
   <p>The Bottom Line: Other video cameras that offer little more are about
   twice the price.

   

 <h>  Full Review
 <p>  This video camera is certainly not the best out there...yet it is not
   the worst. I would say that this video camera gives you the middle
   ground features and also the middle ground price. This was the
   determining factor that resulted into the purchase of this product. If
   you plan to do professional video editing, then get a higher end model
   which has digital video out (Firewire, USB, etc.) it will make your
   life less painful.
   <p>Features:
   <p>This video camera has all the basic features one would expect from a
   camcorder such as, recording and playback capabilities. Added with
   these are a few that Sony has made a trademark of their camcorders
   such as the LCD screen, the 0 Lux technology, the InfoLITHIUM battery,
   the Halogen light source, and that the video camera records in Hi8
   which is supposed to increase the resolution of the picture thus a
   finer grain/pixel.
   <p>LCD:
   <p>The LCD screen included with the TRV-308 with a diagonal measurement
   of 2.5" is not the largest in it's class, but sufficient to prevent
   eye strain. It gives a brilliance of colors comparable or yet better
   than other camcorders in this price range. Sony boasts that "...over
   99.99% of the pixels are operational for effective use."
   <p>Pros:
   <p>The LCD is very useful for use when you are shooting on the move. It
   lets you keep your eyes on the road and also on your subject being
   captured. During playback the use of the LCD is a godsend. (Have you
   ever tried watching a video through the B&W eye-viewfinder?)
   <p>Cons:
   <p>Drains battery faster than using the eye-viewer. In bright direct
   sunlight the LCD screen is not bright enough to be used.
   <p>0 Lux:
   <p>The 0 Lux (or Zero Lux...in case you thought it was an "o".)
   technology is very useful for that time when you happen to spot Big
   Foot or something in the dark wilderness...j/k. When sliding the
   nightshot option to the "On" position a little infrared LED turns on
   inside the tinted plastic window below the camera lens to cover a
   small area (up to 6-8 feet out..though you may see much more too
   because stars and such emit infrared waves.). The infrared then
   bounces back and the lens picks up the light.
   <p>The technology used by Sony is quite impressive. Sitting in a totally
   dark room, looking through the camera viewfinder you can see as though
   a spot light was being sent out by the camera. In total darkness the
   contrast (note the screen is green when in 0 Lux mode) is remarkable.
   In areas that are well lighted the screen seems to be gritty with
   buzzing white pixels. The lens easily gets saturated by excessive
   infrared waves and has little or no circuitry to combat such
   situations.
   <p>0 Lux Pros:
   <p>Good tool to video tape at night time. Sufficient for the average
   user. Excellent option for the price.
   <p>0 Lux Cons:
   <p>Easily saturated by excessive lighting.
   <p>InfoLITHIUM:
   <p>The Lithium batteries for the sony systems are quite handy because
   battery life can be estimated by the camcorders, thus the term Info in
   InfoLITHIUM. The battery included (NP-FM30) is rated 165 minutes
   continuous use and 90 minutes typical with the viewfinder and 120
   minutes continuous use and 65 minutes typical with the LCD screen. The
   included battery is not sufficient for traveling or in video taping
   long events. The worst thing is that these Sony batteries are
   devastatingly expensive. Some of the larger batteries that feature 2-3
   times the capacity of the given battery above can run as much as $100
   plus. The worse thing is if you plan on using your camcorder often
   plan on spending a small fortune on batteries. The typical lifetime of
   a battery is less than one year.
   <p>Pros:
   <p>Minutes left are displayed so you never get surprised by a dying
   battery.
   <p>Cons:
   <p>Batteries with more capacity are expensive. Operational battery life
   not long.
   <p>Halogen Light Bulb:
   <p>The halogen light bulb is a decent source of light to use when
   lighting conditions fall on the dim side. The light can be turned on
   by pressing the "Light" button located next to the "STOP", "REW",
   "PLAY", buttons. I have used the light a few times and though it seems
   small it does provide ample lighting and is effective enough for
   indoor use. I liked the old countersunk/flush light design more
   because it looked better and is less vulnerable to impact. Though I
   feel Sony went this way because replacing blown bulbs would be easier
   with the new design.
   <p>Hi8:
   <p>The Hi8 format used by the sony camcorders provide real life like
   colors and have good enough resolution so that if shown on full size
   TV the picture quality is not deminished. The only thing better than
   the Hi8 format is going fully digital (Digital8) which is featured in
   higher end camcorders. It is a good feature and you should not settle
   for anything less than Hi8.
   <p>Video Outputs:
  <p> The TRV-308 provides: S-Video out, A/V out.
   <p>S-Video out is simply the S-Video output you see on your computer
   video card or DVD player.
   <p>The A/V out is outputted via a phono jack. The wire to do the decoding
   has a phono type jack as an output to the VCR/DVD/TV and two RCA
   composite inputs on the other end. One of the RCA inputs are for Video
   and the other for Audio thus only providing a mono audio output.
   <p>Conclusions:
   <p>There are tons of features that I do not cover simply because it would
   be too long for me to write (I don't have much time). Overall this
   video camera gives you the middle ground in features and the semi-low
   end in price which makes it a great buy!
   <p>If you research the market well you will see that other video cameras
   that offer little more are about twice the price. My only gripe is
   that Sony camcorders have a record for the video tape "bay" mechanisms
   breaking down early. It seems to be due to the complex mechanical
   design of the Ejection system, more moving parts mean more parts to
   break. Though mine has not broken yet, I have yet to find out if it
   will (I've only had mine for about 7 months). So far I am happy with
   my purchase. Will you? You'll only know if you get one!
