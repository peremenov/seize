   setting, staking or checking traps or assisting another person with
   these activities.

     <p>* You may not set a trap in such a manner that it causes a captured
       animal to be fully suspended in the air.
     <p>* You may not set a trap on a public road. You are allowed to set a
       trap in a culvert or ditch unless the property is posted or the
       landowner does not allow trapping.
     <p>* Foothold traps larger than 4 inches must be covered when set on
       land.

   <h>Water
     <p>* You may set a trap in a permanent body of water only when the
       mink, muskrat, otter, or beaver season is open.
     <p>* You may not disturb a beaver lodge, beaver dam, or muskrat house
       or den.
     <p>* Traps may not be set on or within 15 feet of a beaver lodge at any

       animal.
     <p>* You may not set or stake a trap prior to 7:00 a.m. on opening day.
     <p>* You are not allowed to set a trap within 100 feet of a house,
       school, playground or church unless you have permission from the
       owner of the land where the trap is set.

  <h>Pelt Sealing

   <p>Beaver, otter, bobcat, fisher and marten must have a plastic seal
   attached to the pelt or unskinned animal before:
     <p>* It is sold or ownership is transferred to another person, or
     <p>* It is mounted or tanned, or
     <p>* It leaves New York State, or
     <p>* 10 days have passed since the close of the season where the fur
       was taken.
       <p>The plastic pelt seals can be removed when the pelt is processed
       for taxidermy, tanning or manufacturing.

   <p>Here is how you get your pelts sealed. It is a 2 step process.

   <p>Step 1-- Filling out your furbearer possession tag Click for printable
   tag.
     <p>* A possession tag must be filled out for each animal you take.
     <p>* Possession tags must be filled out immediately after you reach
       your motor vehicle, camp or home, whichever comes first.
     <p>* Possession tags must stay with the animal or pelt at all times but
       they do not need to be attached to the pelt.

   <p>Step 2-- Getting your pelt sealed All Species
     <p>* A completed furbearer possession tag must be submitted to obtain a
       plastic pelt seal.
     <p>* You can give your pelts to another person (other than a
       taxidermist) so he or she can get the pelts sealed or get them
       skinned. You must give that person your trapping license or a copy
       of your license and your completed possession tags while he or she
       has your pelts.

   <h>Beaver
     <p>* Furbearer possession tags for beaver can be submitted by mail, FAX
       (518) 402-8925 or in person.
     <p>* You also may report a beaver using the DECALS call-in system. Call
       1-866-GAME-RPT.
     <p>* Once you have submitted your possession tag(s) for beaver you will
       be sent or given the plastic pelt seal(s) and instructions.
     <p>* Immediately upon receipt of seal(s), you must attach the seal(s)
       to the pelt(s).

   <h>Otter, Bobcat, Fisher and Marten
     * Only authorized Department representatives can attach the plastic
       pelt seals to otter, bobcat, fisher or marten.
     * Call the regional wildlife office to make arrangements to get your
       otter, bobcat, fisher, or marten sealed.
     * Prior to having a marten sealed, you must submit the entire
       carcass.

  <h>Coyote Reporting

     <p>* Report your coyote by calling the DECALS call-in system. Call
       1-866-GAMERPT (1-866-426-3778).
     <p>* You may use the furbearer Possession Tag to write down the
       information before you call.

  <h>Buying and Selling Fur

     <p>* Species requiring a pelt seal cannot be bought or sold or given to
       another person unless it has the plastic pelt seal on it. All
       other species may be bought, sold, and transported without
       restriction.
     <p>* Furbearers may be bought or sold either skinned or unskinned.
     <p>* People who buy fur do not need a fur buyer's license in New York.
