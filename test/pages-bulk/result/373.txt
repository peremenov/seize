<h>Nuclear disarmament and Non-Proliferation

           <h>Report on Government Consultations with Civil Society
                         on Selected Nuclear Issues
                         <p>Ottawa, 3-4 February 2000

   <h>Background

   <p>In its April 1999 response to the Standing Committee on Foreign
   Affairs and International Trade (SCFAIT)'s report Canada and the
   Nuclear Challenge: Reducing the Political Value of Nuclear Weapons for
   the Twenty-First Century, the Government agreed to hold annual
   consultations with non-governmental organizations and other
   representatives of civil society on Canada's nuclear
   non-proliferation, arms control and disarmament (NACD) policy. The
   Government's goal was to hold an informed exchange of views on
   pertinent global questions, to provide a briefing on the Government's
   approaches and to seek external analysis and ideas on ways forward.

   <p>Following informal consultations initiated by the Department of
   Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT)'s Non-Proliferation,
   Arms Control and Disarmament Division, a Steering Group of NGO,
   academic and government representatives was formed in November 1999 to
   set dates, draft an agenda and generate a list of participants for the
   inaugural round of these annual consultations. Members of the Steering
   Group include David Dewitt (York University), Albert Legault
   (Universit√© Laval), Brian Job (UBC), Dr. Jennifer Simons (Simons
   Foundation), Ernie Regehr (Project Ploughshares) and Debbie Grisdale
   (Physicians for Global Survival), as well as representatives from
   DFAIT and the Department of National Defence (DND).

   <p>The Steering Group (SG) agreed that it would be best to have
   small-scale and focussed consultations. It was recognized that a group
   of this limited size would facilitate a free and frank exchange of
   ideas in a single plenary format. Accordingly, on the basis of the
   SG's recommendations, invitations were issued to (and accepted by)
   twenty academic and NGO representatives, making for a total (with
   government representatives) of approximately thirty participants (see
   Appendix). The consultations were held at the Government Conference
   Centre in Ottawa on 3-4 February 2000.

   <p>The format of the consultations combined thematic and fora/topical
   approaches, with Day One focussed thematically on broad nuclear issues
   (disarmament, non-proliferation, the international security context)
   and Day Two focussed on specific fora and issues (the NPT, NATO,
   ballistic missiles, verification and control mechanisms). The
   Honourable Bill Graham, the chairman of SCFAIT, addressed participants
   at lunch on the first day; later that same day the Honourable Lloyd
   Axworthy, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, participated in a
   roundtable discussion.

   <p>As agreed by the Steering Group, this report is a record of the views
   expressed on various issues as well as the main recommendations that
   emerged from the discussions. With the exception of Minister
   Axworthy's and Mr. Graham's remarks, the report follows " Chatham
   House" rules (non-attribution of statements). As agreed by the
   Steering Group, this report is not a negotiated document. It was
   drafted by DFAIT in consultation with the members of the Steering
   Group who participated in the 3-4 February meeting.

   <h>Introduction

   <p>The opening session touched briefly on the main issues at stake and on
   participants' expectations of what these Consultations might
   accomplish.

   <p>It was noted that the substantive focus of the two-day session could
   be characterized as a " promise unfulfilled" : what had drawn the
   participants together was the fact that, ten years after the end of
   the conflict that spawned the most lethal arsenals humankind had ever
   known, progress on reducing those arsenals was effectively stalled.
   Indeed, far from looking forward to a post-Cold War world free of
   nuclear weapons, we found ourselves in a situation where some military
   planners were dreaming up new missions for nuclear weapons, would-be
   proliferators had carried out nuclear tests, and some of the
   non-nuclear-weapon states who had renounced nuclear weapons were
   having second thoughts.

   <p>Why hold consultations? Policy making could benefit from dialogue
   between interested individuals within and outside government. More
   importantly, it was recognized that in an era of ever-diminishing
   resources, all those with an active stake in nuclear
   non-proliferation, arms control and disarmament issues - whether
   government, academics, NGOs or concerned individuals - needed to
   support one another and work together. This was especially relevant
   for a country like Canada, whose international reach often tended to
   exceed its increasingly constrained grasp. Choices had to be made and
   limited resources had to be pooled and leveraged effectively; a good
   consultative process was essential.

   <p>Following these introductory remarks, there was a motion from the
   floor to suggest that the title of the consultations be modified to
   reflect the fact that not all nuclear-related issues - for example,
   nuclear energy - would be covered during the two-day session. It was
   agreed that the meeting would be re-titled " Government Consultations
   with Civil Society on Selected Nuclear Issues" .

   <h>Session I: The International Security Context

   <p>A prominent theme was the degree to which Canada - by virtue of its
   membership in NATO and association with that Alliance's nuclear
   policy, actions in Kosovo and what some view as a " provocative"
   expansion to the East - was itself contributing to an international
   environment which made others feel less secure. Several participants
   attributed recent disquieting trends in Russian behaviour - above all,
   the dramatic lowering of the nuclear threshold in Moscow's new
   military doctrine - to Russia's perceived need to compensate for the "
   humiliation" NATO had dealt it over Kosovo.

   <p>Russia, it was observed by some speakers, remained a crucial actor on
   the international scene and a major challenge because of its desire to
   command the respect and influence of bygone superpower days without
   the real clout to demand it. Engaging Russia was crucial to global
   stability, yet a number of speakers feared that the " window of
   opportunity" opened by the end of the Cold War had been missed.

   <p>Some participants asserted a growing gap between the internationalist
   norms that have traditionally underpinned Canada's conception of a
   just and stable world order and the " unilateralism" practised by our
   closest neighbour and ally. One speaker asserted that, whether one
   liked it or not, Canada's security during the Cold War era was founded
   on Western deterrence, hence our alliance with the USA, but that
   today, US policies - such as the pursuit of National Missile Defence
   and the Senate's rejection of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban
   Treaty - were contributing to a less stable international environment
   that was not in Canada's security interests.

   <p>Some suggested that Canada had nothing to lose and much to gain by
   acting together with like-minded countries independently of the US,
   with a number of participants arguing forcefully in this regard that,
   where nuclear weapons were concerned, Canada ought to adopt " a pure
   and simple abolition policy." Others noted that Canada's ability to
   distance itself from US positions appeared to be determined in an
   entirely " arbitrary" manner, suggesting the need for greater
   transparency in the process by which the government established how
   far a given security interest could be distanced from the range of
   other Canadian interests with the USA.

   <p>Asia was flagged as the region that represented the greatest danger of
   a conflict either involving nuclear weapons (eg. India-Pakistan) or
   threatening to draw in nuclear weapon states (NWS) (eg. China-Taiwan).
   Here again the perils of US " unilateralism" were argued by some
   participants, with one underlining how US pursuit of Theatre Missile
   Defence (TMD) in the region was viewed by China as a direct threat to
   its fundamental national interests. Another speaker mused about the
   potential for " de-coupling" between the Asian regional and the larger
   international security systems, wondering out loud whether we in the
   West had any idea what we would do if the India-Pakistan conflict in
   fact went nuclear: would we help to clean up? Would we have the
   capacity to do so?

   <p>On the question of broader approaches to security, it was argued by
   one speaker that the Canadian peace movement had always favoured a
   holistic approach that underlined how factors such as environmental
   degradation and inadequate development assistance contributed to
   insecurity; when dealing with the security challenges posed, for
   example, by the Democratic Peoples' Republic of Korea (DPRK), " more
   than their missiles" needed to be addressed. Canada's " human
   security" agenda was a step in the right direction but could not,
   others asserted, be considered a success so long as Canada continued
   to export military goods to states violating human rights or
   undermining human security and kept its international development
   assistance at unacceptably low levels.

   <p>The issue of " double standards" came up repeatedly. A number of
   participants wondered why Kosovo and East Timor were deemed worthy of
   " humanitarian intervention" while other long-suffering regions were
   not. The point was made in reply that just because the international
   community was incapable of intervening everywhere did not mean it
   should intervene nowhere; Canada had to do what it could under the
   circumstances.

   <p>Condemnation of India's and Pakistan's nuclear ambitions was also
   deemed by some to be hypocritical: how could these two countries be
   told to renounce nuclear weapons when the five NWS had not done so and
   when the Alliance of which Canada was a member embraced them? It was
   argued in reply that while a contradiction might exist, it diminished
   when one factored in the element of time, that is, the fact that all
   parties to the NPT were committed to the eventual elimination of
   nuclear weapons. The NPT could be seen as discriminatory in that it
   permitted the five NWS a status denied all others, yet the fact that
   187 states had agreed to accept this state of affairs in order to
   enjoy the broader benefits of the regime suggested that the flaw was
   not fatal. It was suggested that to accept India and Pakistan's
   arguments was to adopt an " NRA approach" to arms control, i.e. to
   advocate that " everyone" should have nuclear weapons.

   <h>Luncheon Address by the Honourable Bill Graham

   <p>The Honourable Bill Graham, chairman of the Standing Committee on
   Foreign Affairs and International Trade, delivered a luncheon address
   which drew its title from the December 1998 SCFAIT Report, " Reducing
   the Political Value of Nuclear Weapons."

   <p>Mr. Graham contended that the current strains on the NPT regime - from
   the South Asia nuclear tests to the lack of progress on START - served
   to reinforce the central message of the SCFAIT Report: that the major
   challenge of nuclear weapons, in addition to preventing their further
   proliferation by strengthening the NPT regime, was to work to reduce
   their perceived political value in order to contribute to the goal of
   their progressive reduction and eventual elimination. Minister
   Axworthy's initial request that SCFAIT undertake the study that led to
   the December 1998 Report, Mr. Graham suggested, was testimony to the
   energy and engagement of the NGOs represented at these first annual
   Consultations. The Consultations themselves, Mr. Graham noted, were a
   welcome outcome of the SCFAIT Report.

   <p>Some had been disappointed, Mr. Graham recalled, by the SCFAIT
   Report's failure to recommend that NATO adopt a policy of No First Use
   of nuclear weapons. Mr. Graham held that while it had been appropriate
   for SCFAIT to urge that NATO review its nuclear weapons policy to take
   into account dramatic changes in the post-Cold War security
   environment, it had not been the Committee's place to tell NATO what
   conclusions to reach. Mr. Graham welcomed the commitment to a policy
   review agreed at the NATO Ministerial in December 1999, and suggested
   that hard lobbying by Canadian M.P.s of their NATO country
   counterparts at the earlier Istanbul Summit had helped pave the way
   for this outcome.

   <p>There was a lesson here for participants in the Consultations, he
   continued. Canadian NGOs should maintain close contacts with NGOs in
   other countries and get them to press their politicians the way Mr.
   Graham and his colleagues had pressed in Istanbul. The US was key,
   given its unique ability to lead on disarmament questions from a
   position of strength; unfortunately these questions tended to play in
   a manner that put the US against everyone else, with the failure of
   the CTBT a case in point.

   <p>What was needed was to engage the Americans in a different way, to
   show them how action to strengthen the NPT regime would be in their
   own best interest. US opinion, Mr. Graham recalled, was not
   monolithic. The CTBT was voted down in the US Senate for purely
   partisan reasons, not on its merits. Many of Mr. Graham's American
   counterparts were still wrestling with these issues; we were not
   without allies south of the border. Mr. Graham looked forward to
   continuing to promote support for the NPT at the next meeting of the
   Canada-US Parliamentary Group in May 2000, and whenever else the
   occasion rose to do so.

   <p>During the question and answer session that followed Mr. Graham's
   remarks, one speaker lamented the fact that NACD issues ranked so low
   among the US public's concerns, and suggested that this in effect
   freed Congress to act however it saw fit on such important issues as
   the CTBT and NMD. Another questioner pointed out that, according to
   polls, popular American support for the U.N. is higher than support
   either for Congress or for NATO. Mr. Graham noted that Members of
   Congress still play a key role and it was our job to try to help to
   push them in the right direction.

   <h>Session II: Nuclear Disarmament

   <p>While many participants characterized the current state of nuclear
   disarmament efforts as one of " crisis" , views were not unanimous in
   this regard. One speaker suggested that the failure to achieve reform
   of the UN Security Council was more worrisome than the rate of
   progress on Article VI of the NPT. That said, the main elements of the
   " crisis" perspective received a thorough airing.

   <p>The United States Senate's failure to ratify the CTBT - which
   represented decades of work - was singled out by many speakers as a
   particularly hard blow to the disarmament cause. The doubts about
   verifiability that had helped to sink the Treaty were seen as a
   further manifestation of a growing distrust of multilateralism in the
   US.

   <p>But the problems went well beyond the US. The West as a whole, it was
   suggested, was not pulling its weight to give Russia the financial
   assistance it needed to carry out arms control commitments made since
   the end of the Cold War. The continued attraction of nuclear
   deterrence was a major factor in the view of some participants;
   whether justified or not, countries such as India and Israel felt
   safer with nuclear weapons than without. Prestige - the perception
   that possessing nuclear weapons gave you a place " at the high table"
   of international politics - played a role as well.

   <p>On the way ahead, it was proposed that Canada simultaneously pursue
   incremental approaches and outright abolition, on the grounds that
   incrementalism on its own was pointless without a clear sense of the
   final destination, but also that it was important not to force others
   to choose between the two because this would simply lose Canada
   allies. It was also argued that there was something to be said for
   measured - as opposed to " speedy" - progress, in the sense that the
   existing infrastructure for dismantling weapons was already going full
   tilt and that plutonium poorly secured in a warehouse might be more
   dangerous than plutonium remaining in a warhead.

   <p>This view was countered by a vigorous appeal from other speakers for
   Canada to adopt the more ambitious approach of the " New Agenda"
   Coalition (NAC), specifically the NAC's call on the NWS to undertake
   an " unequivocal commitment" to accomplish the " speedy and total
   elimination" of their nuclear arsenals " without delay." Canada, these
   speakers argued, was already well down this road; the fact that it had
   abstained on the " New Agenda" resolution at the past two UN General
   Assemblies should not prevent Canada from working with the NAC to
   achieve the " unequivocal commitment" it sought. According to this
   view, the positions Canada had adopted at the last NPT Preparatory
   Committee, while praiseworthy, fell short of what was required to meet
   the current " crisis" . NAC representatives were reportedly putting
   out the word that adoption of an " unequivocal commitment" to
   disarmament along the lines of their UNGA resolutions was the "
   minimum" requirement for a successful NPT Review Conference this
   spring.

   <p>On the implications of such a move for our relations with the United
   States, one participant suggested that many American officials would
   welcome Canada's full endorsement of the NAC platform as a way to help
   them press US decision-makers to take stronger action on disarmament.
   The broader issue of how best to reinforce those American
   constituencies which favour disarmament was also addressed. One
   participant underlined the need for a " two-pronged strategy" of
   engaging both the government and NGOs, it being most important, in the
   US context, that lobbying for a more forthcoming policy on NACD issues
   be seen to be domestically generated rather than a result of outside
   pressures. Another speaker lamented the general lack of US awareness
   of these issues, rooted, this speaker suggested, in the fact that most
   Americans read USA Today, not the New York Times or Washington Post.

   <p>The problem of apathy - the fact that the general public seemed to
   have forgotten the danger of nuclear weapons following the end of the
   Cold War - was discussed at some length. It was noted that while
   biological and chemical weapons are seen as abhorrent, the same
   standard did not seem to apply to nuclear weapons. The nuclear
   disarmament drive's loss of steam could be attributed in part to
   post-Cold War developments: the prospect of nuclear annihilation not
   only seemed increasingly remote, but had also understandably paled in
   a world that had witnessed mass murder with machetes and the
   re-appearance of concentration camps in Europe.

   <p>Engaging youth was underlined as a key imperative, with one
   participant proposing a " youth Prep Com" in the run-up to the NPT
   Review Conference as one way to educate the younger generation on the
   issues at stake. As far as the contribution NGOs could make to raising
   awareness among youth and the broader public, severe financial
   constraints were flagged as the major limiting factor. At the
   diplomatic level, it was noted that the current deadlock in the
   Committee on Disarmament (CD) inhibited substantive discussion of
   important NACD issues even among officials; this suggested a need to
   think creatively about ways to break the logjam, for example by
   forging new coalitions (on the NAC example) to put the outdated
   groupings of the Cold War behind us.

   <h>Session III: Nuclear Non-Proliferation 

   <p>Picking up on a number of themes raised earlier in the day's
   discussions, this session focussed on the causes of nuclear
   proliferation and on the practical steps Canada could or should be
   taking to combat it. As the world's largest exporter of uranium, one
   speaker argued, Canada had a special responsibility to be active in
   this area.

   <p>A short historical overview of proliferation was offered to counter
   the impression that the problem had emerged only in recent years.
   India's nuclear capability dated back to 1974, one speaker noted and
   linked this development to fissile material derived (illicitly) from a
   Canadian-supplied research reactor. Pakistan had reportedly been
   nuclear capable since the late 1980s, others noted; Israel's
   unacknowledged nuclear weapons program appeared to date to the early
   1970s; and the DPRK and Iraq's nuclear aspirations had been known for
   some time.

   <p>Why go nuclear? Several categories of incentives were identified:
   conflictual relationship with a NWS; desire for " great power" status;
   the quest for regional hegemony; or, in the case of " rogue" states, a
   desire to make great powers think twice about intervening. As to the
   reverse - why some states had given up the nuclear option - it was
   suggested that the overriding factor was a significant lessening or
   elimination of the enduring rivalry with another state that had
   triggered pursuit of the option in the first place.

   <p>In this regard, one participant suggested that the " high moral
   ground" Canada had adopted with respect to India and Pakistan was not
   that effective. The two countries' decision to test nuclear devices
   could be seen as a response to genuine security concerns, it was
   argued, in which case Canada would be better off to engage them in
   ways that might see these concerns addressed.

   <p>Several speakers noted that another lesson taught by the South Asia
   nuclear tests was that it was impossible to have non-proliferation
   without disarmament: the NWS's continued attachment to their arsenals
   offered India and Pakistan a rich source of justification. It did not
   follow, however, that the 1995 indefinite extension of the NPT had
   been a mistake; the argument was forcefully made that the world was
   much better off with an indefinitely extended NPT than it would have
   been without it.

   <p>Several recommendations were made with respect to Canadian policy,
   most premised on the argument that Canada should distance itself from
   the US and seek coalitions of more like-minded multilateralists. With
   respect to NATO's current review of policy options on verification,
   confidence and security building measures, non-proliferation, arms
   control and disarmament, for example, some participants urged Canada
   to do more by " divorcing" itself from the Alliance's nuclear policies
   and pushing for a policy of No First Use by all NWS. It was also
   suggested that Canada support calls to amend the NPT to specify a
   timetable for disarmament under Article VI; indefinite extension, it
   was argued, should not mean indefinite possession of nuclear weapons
   by the NWS. The government was encouraged to hold a conference to
   support a Nuclear Weapons Convention, as well as to throw its support
   unreservedly behind the New Agenda Coalition.

   <p>One speaker's remark to the effect that nuclear disarmament was a
   critical precondition for enjoying the positive benefits of nuclear
   power launched a vigorous discussion of Canadian nuclear energy
   policy. One participant called for separate consultations devoted
   exclusively to nuclear energy issues, including government policy on
   plutonium and the export of uranium. The central argument was that
   Canada's non-proliferation efforts had no credibility given our
   alleged failure to oppose the use and stock-piling of plutonium.
   Assurances were offered that Canadian policy in this sphere was
   entirely consistent with our NPT obligations, that all separated
   plutonium was under IAEA safeguards and all evidence suggested that
   this non-proliferation regime was working exceedingly well.

   <h>Session IV: Roundtable with Minister Axworthy

   <p>Minister Axworthy was briefed at the outset on the principal themes
   that had emerged during the three preceding sessions. The core issue,
   it was suggested, was a genuine concern about Canada's place in the
   nuclear world, and about whether we were pursuing the best policies
   possible. There appeared to be a contradiction between Canada's strong
   support for the NPT and our consistent rejection of nuclear weapons,
   on the one hand, and our continued membership in an Alliance that
   embraced them. The concerns that had been expressed about US
   unilateralism were summarized, in particular how Canada's close
   relations with the US were perceived to constrain our ability to be as
   forceful on nuclear NACD issues as we might otherwise be. We were
   perhaps missing opportunities to build coalitions with other countries
   and with those who shared our views in the US itself; Canada should be
   promoting the benefits of multilateralism more aggressively. It was
   also important to challenge the logic that attracted states to the
   nuclear option, in part by addressing such states' underlying security
   concerns.

   <p>The Minister observed that at times it was tough to find "
   like-minded" allies on nuclear issues. Canada, he pointed out, was the
   only major country to have conducted a comprehensive review of nuclear
   NACD policy since the end of the Cold War. Other issues had captured
   international attention; traditional allies were otherwise occupied;
   Canada had become a " nuclear nag" , urging discussions others were
   reluctant to undertake.

   <p>At the same time, it had to be recognized that our own resources were
   limited. The message the Minister took from the December 1998 SCFAIT
   Report was that Canada should focus its efforts on changing policies
   within NATO, and that is what we were doing. In that regard, our "
   first round" efforts had been successful: against considerable initial
   resistance, Canada had secured a commitment to an important,
   senior-level Review with a timetable for reporting to keep it high on
   the agenda.

   <p>This did not mean that the rest of the nuclear NACD agenda was being
   ignored, however. The Minister reported on his recent discussions with
   Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov in Moscow, where he had expressed
   concern about Russia's new military doctrine. That doctrine's apparent
   increased reliance on nuclear weapons was " not helpful" to efforts to
   reinforce an NPT regime already battered by the nuclear tests in South
   Asia, the US Senate's failure to ratify the CTBT, and continuing
   deadlock in the Committee on Disarmament.

   <p>Canada was working with all the like-minded countries it could find to
   identify ways to strengthen the NPT regime. Minister Axworthy was just
   back from Latin America, where he had useful consultations in this
   regard. Acknowledging the potential dilemma between Canada's NATO
   membership and its support for the New Agenda Coalition, the Minister
   reported broad concurrence with his view that Canada was better off
   trying to foster change from within NATO.

   <p>The Minister turned to the future of the ABM Treaty, which he
   characterized as an important element in the NPT regime. He reported
   telling both FM Ivanov and US Secretary of State Albright in Moscow
   that the ABM Treaty was crucial, that if we lost it, we lost another
   chink in the armour of the NPT. Without downplaying the significant
   political challenges involved, the Minister was encouraged by the
   seriousness of US-Russian discussions on the future of the ABM Treaty.

   <p>Following his opening remarks, the Minister was asked whether Canada
   would support a call for an " unequivocal commitment to disarm" at the
   NPT Review Conference as a way to further shore up our position in
   pushing the NATO Review forward. The Minister noted that a key
   objective must be to get others to acknowledge that the issue of
   nuclear weapons " remains real" . Talk of " weapons of mass
   destruction" (WMD) had become a code for " let's not talk nuclear" .
   It was difficult to find a place for nuclear weapons on an
   increasingly crowded international agenda. The Minister decried
   attempts to downplay the importance of the NPT and upcoming Review
   Conference; we needed to work to counter this.

   <p>It was suggested that Canada take advantage of its Security Council
   presidency in April 2000 to make a Presidential Statement in support
   of the NPT. The Minister thought this was an interesting idea.
   Cautioning that Canada already had a full plate of issues it wanted to
   see addressed during its presidency, the Minister said he would
   nevertheless consider a recommendation along the lines suggested.

   <p>Asked whether Washington would seek a Canadian commitment to
   participate in NMD as part of NORAD's next renewal, the Minister
   replied that this was not the case, that NORAD extension would be
   considered on its own merits.

   <p>Asked about the possibility of civil society engaging NATO at an
   institutional level, the Minister observed that while this was
   unlikely, SCFAIT chair Bill Graham was committed to bringing Canada's
   nuclear NACD concerns to the attention of his colleagues in the NATO
   Parliamentary Assembly. The Minister added that Canada was prepared to
   host a meeting including experts from NATO countries to discuss issues
   related to the NATO review process, though neither a timetable nor a
   format for this event had yet been established.

   <p>The Minister was asked why Canada was unwilling to engage India and
   Pakistan. Noting President Clinton's upcoming visit to India, it was
   suggested that, by taking the " high moral ground" , Canada was losing
   out economically to others. The Minister pointed out that we were in
   fact engaged; he and India FM Singh had met several times, and the
   Indian Minister of the Environment would be visiting Canada shortly.
   But we did not agree on security issues, and we strongly disagreed
   with their nuclear policy, which we thought was dangerous. If other
   countries were prepared to water their wine in this regard that was
   their business; Canada would not. When another speaker later argued
   that Canada should stand firm, that India's anger at not having its
   nuclear status recognized was a measure of our success, the Minister
   observed that it was becoming increasingly hard to hold the line as
   others backed off on the issue.

   <p>The Minister was pressed vigorously by one participant on Canada not
   having a policy prohibiting the reprocessing of spent fuel from
   nuclear reactors. It was suggested that establishing a policy banning
   this practice would be welcomed in the US, which has prohibited the
   re-processing of spent civilian reactor fuel since the Carter
   Administration. A Canadian government official assured the questioner
   that Canada does not reprocess its spent fuel, a process which results
   in the separation of plutonium. And while Canadian uranium is
   reprocessed by other countries and the plutonium burned again as mixed
   oxide fuel, verification measures and policies were in place to ensure
   that such spent fuel was used solely for peaceful purposes. That is to
   say, all of these countries are signatories to the NPT, have all of
   their nuclear facilities under fullscope International Atomic Energy
   Agency (IAEA) safeguards and there are no indications that this
   civilian plutonium is being diverted for military purposes. Given that
   safeguards are working well on civilian spent fuel, the focus of
   attention should be on bringing military plutonium under IAEA
   safeguards. That is why the Canadian government is considering the use
   of MOX fuel in CANDU reactors as a way of potentially disposing of
   Russian weapons-grade plutonium, a process which will be under IAEA
   safeguards.

   <p>The same participant asked the Minister to consider holding
   consultations with civil society at an early date on Canadian policy
   with respect to such issues as plutonium and the dispositioning of
   Mixed Oxide Fuel (MOX), where, it was alleged, government policy had
   been characterized by a lack of transparency. The Minister pointed out
   that related questions had been answered in the House of Commons and
   before the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International
   Trade. Where MOX was concerned, the Minister reminded participants
   that Canada had only agreed to undertake a feasibility test; any
   further steps would be taken only following a formal invitation by
   other countries for Canada to participate, negotiation of a
   commercially viable arrangement with a Canadian utility (no government
   subsidies) and meeting of all the federal and provincial regulations
   regarding health, safety, and environment, a process which would
   include an opportunity for full public consultations.

   <h>Session V: The NPT and Related Agreements

   <p>This session reviewed Canadian options for the upcoming (April 24-May
   19) NPT 2000 Review Conference, as well as other approaches to nuclear
   disarmament such as a Nuclear Weapons Convention.

   <p>The outcomes of the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference (NPTREC)
   were reviewed. The point was made that the three NPTREC Decisions - on
   indefinite extension, principles and objectives, and a strengthened
   review process - and the NPTREC resolution on the Middle East must be
   seen as a complete package whose relevance and integrity had to be
   supported in their entirety. Contrary to the view of some states that
   these documents had been " cast in stone" , however, it was argued
   that the decisions on principles and objectives and on the
   strengthened review process had been conceived as " works in progress"
   , to be clarified and updated to meet changing circumstances.

   <p>Against this backdrop, it was suggested that Canada's goals at the
   2000 Review Conference should be (1) to promote and protect the
   universality of the Treaty; (2) to enhance the strengthened review
   process further, and thereby ensure the " accountability" promised in
   1995 as an integral part of the extension package; (3) to reach
   agreement on a new Principles and Objectives (P&O) document to
   establish concrete benchmarks against which accountability could be
   measured during the next review period (2000-2005) and (4) to achieve
   the political-level engagement necessary for success by promoting
   public awareness of the Review Conference and the NPT in general. On
   this last point, government funding was requested to enable NGOs to
   attend the Review Conference and to participate in lobbying and
   educational activities. It was also requested that Canada call for a
   seat for an NGO observer at the Review Conference, and that a Canadian
   NGO be permitted to fully participate in the Canadian delegation.

   <p>On the need to enhance the strengthened review process, it was noted
   that although France in 1999 had circulated a booklet detailing its
   disarmament efforts and although there were indications that the US
   planned to do the same in New York this spring, the NPT community had
   yet to agree on a way to record this progress officially. One
   participant submitted that what was needed was not merely a " review"
   but a " real assessment" , article-by-article, against measurable
   criteria, with an emphasis on disarmament under Article VI.

   <p>It was stressed that any " P&O 2000" document should be seen as a
   complement to, not a replacement for, the P&O agreed in 1995. It was
   also important to remember that the NPT represented a three-part
   bargain - disarmament, non-proliferation, and cooperation on peaceful
   uses of nuclear energy - that had to be complied with in its entirety,
   not " a la carte" . Further progress on bringing about entry into
   force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) - which was
   the leading objective in the 1995 document - was essential if any new
   set of objectives for 2000-2005 was to have any credibility.

   <p>Canada's May 1999 Working Paper proposing language for a P&O 2000
   document was criticized for not going far enough: what was needed, it
   was asserted, was an " unequivocal commitment" on the part of the NWS
   to do away with their arsenals without delay. The argument that the
   unequivocal commitment was already there - in Article VI of the NPT -
   was not accepted by all participants. Several speakers argued that
   Canada should take the lead in efforts to negotiate a Nuclear Weapons
   Convention (NWC), either via an Amendment Conference under Article
   VIII or outside the NPT process altogether. It was further suggested
   by some speakers that, by supporting NATO's nuclear policies and not
   voting in favour of the New Agenda Coalition at the UN, Canada was
   disregarding the Advisory Opinion of the International Court of
   Justice on the requirement to negotiate nuclear disarmament. The
   government was further accused of never having declared itself in
   favour of an outright ban on nuclear weapons.

   <p>It was asked whether Canada might not seek to act as a bridge between
   those who sought immediate progress towards an NWC and those who were
   reluctant: commitment to a step-by-step process would fit this bill,
   it was argued, provided it were in the context of an unequivocal
   commitment to " get to zero [nuclear weapons]" . It was suggested in
   reply that Canada was already playing such a role, for example through
   its work with members of the New Agenda Coalition in the UNGA First
   Committee.

   <p>With respect to calls for a " ban" on nuclear weapons, it was
   suggested that Canada's support for the unanimous element of the ICJ
   decision - the legal obligation to pursue in good faith negotiations
   to achieve nuclear disarmament in all its aspects - amounted to
   support for a ban, but that excessive talk along these lines was
   counterproductive. Doubts were also expressed by some participants
   about the utility of an NWC which, it was argued, sought a commitment
   on final outcome before negotiations started; other participants were
   not convinced by this reasoning, however.

   <p>Attention was drawn to the regional security problems that lie at the
   root of key challenges to the NPT regime. According to one
   participant, inducing India and Pakistan to sign the NPT, for example,
   would do little to address the real sources of instability in South
   Asia, yet supporters of the regime lacked a coherent strategy in this
   regard. It was further suggested by one participant that the real
   future danger to the NPT regime came less from so-called " rogue"
   states than from advanced industrial powers who perceived growing
   regional threats. According to this logic, Taiwan, Japan and South
   Korea would be cause for concern long before the likes of Iran.

   <h>Session VI: Nuclear Weapons and NATO

   <p>The session opened with a short review of the evolution in the
   Alliance's nuclear strategy since the end of the Cold War. The close
   similarity between the 1991 and 1999 Strategic Concepts was
   acknowledged. Canada, it was explained, had pressed for a more
   thorough review of the role of nuclear weapons in the 1999 document,
   pointing out that the image of the most powerful alliance on earth
   relying on nuclear weapons sent an unwelcome message. Allies had
   resisted such a review, however, fearing a " divisive debate" that
   might have " spoiled" the Alliance's 50^th anniversary celebration at
   the Washington Summit in April 1999. Against this background, the
   commitment Canada had won at the Summit and at the subsequent December
   1999 NATO Ministerial to a review of Alliance policy options on
   verification, confidence and security building measures,
   non-proliferation, arms control and disarmament was significant. NATO
   Ministers had agreed: 1) to task a top NATO body - the Senior
   Political Committee - with coordinating the review; 2) that a concrete
   product - a report - would be prepared; and 3) that this would be done
   to a specific deadline (December 2000).

   <p>Acknowledging that it was still too early to tell how the review
   process would unfold, a few prognoses were offered. With nineteen
   Allies, progress was sure to be slow and incremental. A fundamental
   review of Alliance nuclear strategy was unlikely, some argued; this
   would be opposed not only by the US but by the UK and especially
   France as well. Others suggested that Canada's traditional
   non-nuclear-weapon state (NNWS) allies could not be expected to take
   up the charge; all were suffering " fatigue" related to their own
   domestic and European political developments. The broader political
   context was seen by one speaker as unfavourable, given difficulties
   with the Russians over Kosovo and now Chechnya, compounded by Moscow's
   differences with Washington over the possible deployment of a National
   Missile Defense (NMD) system. The US's perceived drift toward
   unilateralism and homeland defence was cause for concern but it had
   not yet altogether given up on international law and multilateralism.

   <p>One speaker argued that the increasing US willingness to recognize
   Alliance nuclear weapons as a deterrent against any Weapon of Mass
   Destruction (WMD) would be resisted by Canada and probably others, as
   would any pressures to expand the role of nuclear weapons in Alliance
   strategy. On a more positive note, it was observed that the need to
   re-engage Russia was recognized as a top priority, and suggested that
   steps toward greater transparency and confidence-building measures -
   eg. with respect to tactical nuclear weapons - could be an important
   achievement of the review in this regard. Finally, it was advanced,
   the very fact that the Alliance had undertaken to have a " real
   conversation" on why states acquire nuclear weapons and what role
   NATO's posture played in this was in itself a significant step in the
   right direction.

   <p>The argument that Canada's efforts to push the Alliance on NACD issues
   lacked weight because we had withdrawn our standing forces from Europe
   in 1993 was advanced and rejected: Canada's enormous contribution to
   peacekeeping in post-Cold War Europe was beyond reproach. A more
   significant challenge, it was argued, was the importance that new and
   prospective Alliance members in Eastern Europe attached to the US
   nuclear umbrella, which compounded reluctance to raise the kinds of
   questions Canada wanted to see addressed. NATO's role in " enforcing"
   human security, it was suggested, also made some reluctant to re-think
   the nuclear deterrent.

   <p>The Government of Canada was praised for its efforts to play " nuclear
   nag" within the Alliance, and encouraged to seek more opportunities
   for input and help from the NGO community. The Strategic Concept's
   recognition of the " reduced salience" of nuclear weapons was seen as
   a hopeful " crack in the door" , but why could the Alliance not commit
   to No First Use? What were Canada's aims going into the review? What
   would it settle for? How long was it going to keep the New Agenda
   Coalition at arms length in the interest of working to change NATO "
   from within" ? Many members of the Non-Aligned Movement, it was
   observed, saw NATO's embrace of nuclear weapons as yet another example
   of the West preaching one thing and doing another - which could only
   have a corrosive impact on the NPT.

   <p>At a minimum, it was argued, Canada should work to prevent any
   development that would make the situation worse, for example any
   expansion in the role of nuclear weapons in Alliance strategy. A
   further central goal was to raise awareness within the Alliance of how
   NATO statements - eg. on the " political value" of nuclear weapons -
   provided justification to would-be proliferators. NATO's public
   commitment to undertake a review of policy options in this sphere, it
   was advanced, sent an important signal that would lend credibility to
   Canada's role at the upcoming NPT Review Conference. Canada should
   also, several participants argued, continue to oppose the
   anachronistic argument that the Alliance's nuclear weapons provided a
   crucial " link" between its European and North American members.

   <h>Session VII: Ballistic Missiles

   <p>It was noted at the outset that efforts to come to grips with the
   challenge of missile proliferation were hampered by the absence of
   agreed international norms on issues as basic as what distinguished a
   " good" missile program from a " bad" one. The ideal solution would be
   a binding international Treaty but the myriad of national and
   commercial interests that would have to be reconciled in the process
   rendered this a dubious prospect in the short term. Canada had in fact
   proposed such a Treaty in the mid-1990s but met with stiff resistance
   and dropped the idea. This did not preclude progress in the form of
   smaller steps, however. There were a number of avenues worth pursuing
   in this regard, from confidence and " norm-building" measures such as
   launch notification agreements to efforts to engage potential missile
   proliferators who were outside the Missile Technology Control Regime
   (MTCR).

   <p>There was a long discussion of US proposals to deploy a National
   Missile Defense (NMD) system, the demand for which, it was argued,
   would be diminished by successful efforts to reduce missile
   proliferation. NMD was decried by some speakers as a " provocative"
   manifestation of US unilateralism, a quest for absolute security that,
   by making all other members of the international system feel less
   secure, was ultimately counterproductive and unsustainable. By seeking
   a technological " fix" to the alleged challenge posed by " rogue"
   states, one participant suggested, Washington was overlooking
   alternative solutions: the $10 billion ear-marked for NMD could be
   better spent to promote democratization through aid and engagement.

   <p>Worse, despite doubts on NMD's technical feasibility - which,
   according to a number of experts, were considerable - Russia and China
   were bound to take it seriously. Even a primitive NMD, it was argued,
   would be sufficient to neutralize China's strategic deterrent (20
   ICBMs); whatever Washington's protests to the contrary, Moscow and
   Beijing had every reason to see NMD as part of an effort to seek a
   pre-emptive, first-strike war-fighting capability, an interpretation
   reinforced by the Clinton Administration's insistence on keeping its
   options open for a Phase 2 and Phase 3 following a " limited" Phase 1
   NMD deployment. Their likely response - MIRVing the new Topol-M in the
   case of Russia, an acceleration of long-range missile development
   programs (possibly in cooperation with Moscow) in the case of China -
   could, it was suggested, initiate a classic arms spiral resulting in
   diminished security for all. The implications for regional security in
   Asia were especially disturbing - Japan, for example, might face
   increased pressures to " go nuclear" to counter China's growing ICBM
   force - yet while Washington was working hard to engage Russia on NMD,
   China was receiving far less attention.

   <p>At the same time, it was advanced by one participant, the job of the
   US President as " Commander-in-Chief" was to protect Americans from
   harm, and none of the arguments against NMD addressed this basic fact.
   If a fully deployed NMD system was only 80 percent effective against
   each stage of an ICBM flight, from launch to re-entry, only 1.6 out of
   an attack of 1,000 missiles would get through. Arguing against such
   defensive odds would be a tough sell to the average American. The
   peace movement, it was argued, was against NMD because it was
   de-stabilizing, but this did not imply a preference for deterrence.
   That said, another participant observed, deterrence remained " cheaper
   and less provocative" than NMD.

   <p>One speaker noted that advances in technology (including but by no
   means limited to NMD) raised the spectre of the " weaponization" of
   Outer Space. While no state was yet publicly committed to this step,
   ongoing research and development and loopholes in the 1967 Outer Space
   Treaty banning the orbiting of weapons of mass destruction made
   weaponization cause for concern. Canada had therefore for some time
   been promoting the negotiation of a Convention for the
   Non-Weaponization of Outer Space, but the deadlock in the Committee on
   Disarmament (CD) had so far prevented these efforts from bearing
   fruit.

   <p>Concerns were expressed by some participants about Canada's potential
   role in any NMD deployment. It was suggested that a US deployment
   decision might be based on political considerations unrelated to the
   merits of NMD, and that Canada's response might be shaped by its
   assessment of the needs of its bilateral relationship with the US. In
   particular, it was argued, there would be strong pressure from within
   the Canadian defence establishment to participate to keep Canada on
   the cutting edge of military technology.

   <p>On the relationship between NMD and NORAD, it was noted that while
   there were those at NORAD who saw it as the logical " home" for a
   deployed NMD, the question had not been decided and would require
   Canada's agreement. Some participants suggested that, should it be
   decided to proceed with NMD without Canada, it would be housed in US
   Space Command and NORAD's future would be very much in doubt; others
   pointed out that the relationship between NORAD and US Space Command
   is in fact more complex, and that it was too soon to draw any firm
   conclusions about any prospective NMD-NORAD relationship.

   <h>Session VIII: Verification and Controls

   <p>The importance of verification for the broader NACD agenda was
   underlined by one speaker at the outset, with reference to " the
   biggest and most under-appreciated risk in the world today" - the
   strategic arsenals of the USA and Russia. The merits of the START
   process were outlined, but it was argued that as the USA and Russia
   wound down their nuclear rivalry, other problems became relatively
   more important, including the arsenals of the other nuclear powers
   (declared, de facto, or otherwise), the continued risk of nuclear
   proliferation, and the need for other treaties linked to nuclear
   weapons development, such as test bans.

   <p>The fate of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) was
   highlighted. One of the central arguments Treaty opponents used to
   bring about its defeat in the US Senate, it was recalled, was the
   alleged ease with which other states could duck its provisions. A
   brief review of the extensive verification measures being developed to
   monitor compliance with the Treaty highlighted the shortcomings of
   this argument. The fact that the CTBT Organization's as yet incomplete
   system of monitoring stations successfully detected a 0.1 kiloton test
   explosion in September 1998 spoke for itself in this regard.

   <p>It was noted that the approach to verification embodied in the CTBT -
   in particular, its emphasis on securing multiple sources of data and
   ensuring overlapping capabilities - traced its origins to the United
   Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) experience in Iraq. That mission's
   development of extensive methods - gathering information from a wide
   variety of sources, use of collateral analysis etc - had led to a "
   verification revolution" . When speaking of UNSCOM's successor -
   UNMOVIC (UN Monitoring, Verification, and Inspection Commission) - the
   suggestion was made that it might enjoy a closer relationship with
   IAEA than UNSCOM did, owing to the recent appointment of the former
   head of IAEA as Executive Chair of UNMOVIC. It was acknowledged by
   many participants, however, that Iraq's failure to fulfil all its
   obligations as a party to the NPT had been and remained a significant
   challenge to the nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament regime.
   Even with a budget in the hundreds of millions of dollars and a staff
   of 2200, there were limits to what the International Atomic Energy
   Agency (IAEA) could do.

   <p>Canadian policy in this area was reviewed in some detail. Canada, one
   speaker reported, was working hard to strengthen the nuclear
   safeguards efforts of the IAEA. It had signed the Additional Protocol
   to its fullscope safeguards agreement with the IAEA, the purpose of
   which was to strengthen and improve the efficiency of the safeguards
   system. As a member of the Zangger Committee and the Nuclear Suppliers
   Group (NSG), Canada was working to strengthen export controls and
   encourage greater transparency in their application. Canada welcomed
   the Trilateral Initiative - an undertaking to fulfil US and Russian
   commitments concerning IAEA verification of weapons-origin fissile
   material - and was a party to, and strong supporter of, the 1987
   Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material.

   <p>These efforts, it was suggested, were part of a " global success
   story" : the DPRK and Iraq were the exceptions in an NPT-based
   safeguards system that had proved its merits. While one participant
   argued that the approach was " police-based" , others contended that
   the strength of the regime lay in its promotion of an international
   norm which attached a huge stigma to the illicit development of
   nuclear weapons. Effective controls facilitated peaceful uses of
   atomic energy, one speaker argued, and every grain of exported
   Canadian uranium was safeguarded and monitored. While Canada did not
   reprocess uranium, many countries did so for reasons of cost and
   limiting waste; the plutonium produced as a result was turned into
   mixed oxide (MOX) fuel and burned again, under full safeguards.
   Canada's agreement to consider the use of mixed oxide fuel containing
   US and Russian excess-weapons plutonium in CANDU reactors reflected
   its commitment to dispose of weapons-grade plutonium under IAEA
   safeguards and therefore contribute to the progressive reduction and
   eventual elimination of nuclear weapons.

   <p>A number of participants took strong exception to these arguments,
   which failed to allay their concerns with, for example, Canada's
   policy on depleted uranium and the absence of a ban on separating
   plutonium. One speaker dismissed the proposal to burn US and Russian
   plutonium as MOX fuel as inferior to the alternative of immobilizing
   plutonium through vitrification; others disputed this position. Some
   participants drew attention to the huge domestic costs of uranium
   mining in Canada, in terms of environmental degradation and resulting
   loss of life through higher cancer rates. Here was a good argument, it
   was suggested, to use with India and Pakistan: nuclear facilities have
   made a mess of Canada's lands and water; don't repeat our mistakes.
   Another participant argued that, to achieve the elimination of nuclear
   weapons, Canada had to eliminate the entire " nuclear system" , i.e.
   the North American infrastructure built up to produce bombs over the
   last 50 years. It was further argued that the NPT's promotion of
   peaceful uses togther with non-proliferation represented a " total
   contradiction" , given the irreversible decline now underway in the
   nuclear power industry.

   <h>Wrap Up

   <p>A brief wrap-up session at the conclusion of the second day provided
   an opportunity for a preliminary assessment of the consultations.

   <p>From the government's perspective, the exercise was seen to be a
   success. The relatively small size of the group and broad range of
   constituencies represented had facilitated a good, focussed discussion
   that related directly to upcoming events on the international agenda.
   A solid beginning had been made in the effort to build up a common
   information base among the government, academics and NGOs, an effort
   that would be continued, in part, through the further development of
   the DFAIT web site on NACD issues.

   <p>Several NGO representatives welcomed the opportunity to engage in
   genuine dialogue with the government. A number were struck by how
   prominently the need to promote public awareness of NACD issues had
   figured in the discussions. NGOs were ready to play their part, and
   would welcome government support in this regard. The call for official
   government consultations on Canadian nuclear energy policy was
   re-iterated.

   <p>An academic representative applauded the size, focus, and active
   involvement by all participants in the two-day meeting, but remarked
   on how little expertise there had been on some of the issues raised
   during the course of the discussions, for example on the economics and
   environmental implications of nuclear power. This suggested the need
   for outreach to a wider range of academic disciplines and a more
   comprehensive approach to nuclear issues within the university
   community.
