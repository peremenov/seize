   <p>Are we the heirs of our actions?
   <p>Do we need to accept the doctrine of rebirth in order to practice?
   <p>Am I a 'second class' Buddhist if I don't meditate in my practice?
   <p>Does eating meat implicate me in the killing?

   <p>Q. I have read statements attributed to some Buddhist teachers
   suggesting that various contemporary and historical examples of human
   suffering are the result of the Karma of those who endure that
   suffering. Does this mean that people who endure great suffering were
   deeply unskilful in previous lives and that those who lead otherwise
   pleasant lives were skilful people, and if so how is Karma different
   from the ideas that underpin Caste structures? 

   <p>A. It is believed as the general rule of the law of karma that we are
   bearing the fruit of our actions, whether the result of actions that
   bring fruit instantly, or actions at any time in the past, or actions
   in past lives. But always bear in mind that karmic law is not the
   simplistic two-dimensional principle that we often think it is. Karmic
   law is more often than not the expression of multi-dimensional forces
   that mysteriously interpenetrate and is way beyond the mind's ability
   to comprehend.

   <p>Caste systems are man made, whilst the law of karma is an innate law
   of nature.

   <p>Q. I attempt to sincerely practice the Dharma but have never been able
   to accept the idea of re-birth either in principle or as a matter of
   faith. I accept that the nature of reality is not limited by my
   capacity to comprehend, but I cannot make sense of the idea that we
   are reborn or experience re-becoming. Do you think this is likely to
   undermine my efforts to practice and my spiritual progress? Should I
   just `sit with it and see'? 

   <p>A. I don't think you have to make a problem out of it and feel that
   you are not practising properly. Practice is about dealing with where
   your feet are at this very moment, and therefore you could say that is
   all that is necessary. From my own experience of getting to know
   myself over the years of practice, it became obvious that, with all
   goes that to make me up, with my strong habits and powerful
   attachments, it would be quite absurd to imagine that they just
   materialised out of nothing at birth. You could argue these days that
   genetics may be an answer, but there is a lot in me that cannot be
   applied to that simple idea. And besides, what creates the genetic map
   in the first place?

   <p>In my own personal practice the idea of being born over and over again
   in the lottery of rebirth and suffering has always been a prime
   motivation to practice because of the consequences of my actions
   taught by Buddhism if I chose to ignore them. To believe that life is
   a one off seems to me to negate the whole motivation for Dharma
   cultivation. Yes, we could be motivated to do good for others and
   humanise our own conduct, but if it all comes to nothing in the end
   why should we put the extra effort into changing ourselves that Dharma
   practice demands?

   <p>Definitely 'sit with it ', and if you are still enough you may well
   get to see the principle of becoming being created and acted out
   inside your own mind and body,  and the continuous accumulation of
   karma which demands becoming sooner or later. In the time that you
   have to wait for this understanding to show, take the leap and make
   room within yourself for the indispensable act of faith. Faith in the
   Buddha, the teachings, and all the great sages that have arisen
   throughout the ages, who have continually reaffirmed this law.   Allow
   this to support you in your practice.

   <p>Q. How important is meditation in the spiritual life? The ground of my
   practice is to be found in ethics, and, given the emphasis on
   meditation, this sometimes has the effect of making me feel like a
   second-class Buddhist. 

   <p>A. People who have this idea that practice is all about sitting merely
   display their lack of understanding of the complete process that needs
   to be put in place for the changes that practice brings about. Yes,
   you can say that of all the parts that go toward make a complete
   practice, sitting meditation would be the most important part, but
   sitting will not reach its full potential without the support of the
   rest of the eightfold path. So it is wrong to think that if you can't
   sit you can't practice. There are many people dedicated to Dharma
   practice who have difficulty with sitting meditation.

   <p>So rather than get disheartened learn to focus on the rest of the
   path. Ethical practice is the obvious one to focus on, for it is the
   gateway into the Dharma. Come to realise that while you are refining
   this aspect of the path you are cultivating the mind in the same way
   as sitting practice.

   <p>Restraining and containing actions, whether they are your thoughts,
   words or deeds, is possible only by self-awareness. Putting new
   thoughts, words and deeds into action is only possible with that same
   self-awareness. To do this you need application born of concentration
   and the understanding that your unskilfulness needs to change. Is this
   not working with the eightfold path of sila, samadhi, and prajna? What
   meditation practice will bring to this is a deepening of what you are
   already doing, but fundamentally there is no difference.

   <p>If you wish to come to meditation sometime in the future, then adding
   a devotional practice to an ethical one will help bring you more
   speedily to that roundedness. Devotional practice helps to soften the
   heart and introduces us to the side of ourselves that we need to learn
   to get in contact with in order for the deeper Dharma to arise.
   Devotional practice usually starts by projecting outwards to Buddhas
   and Bodhisattvas, but you should soon realise your relationship with
   this form of external practice is very much conditioned by the inner
   relationship you have with yourself, and therefore should make you
   reflect more and more internally.

   <p>Change that takes place in practice does not come from the head but
   rather from a part of us that we are for the most part cut off from,
   that deep emotional seat buried within our body. It is this that we
   need to become familiar with, and make friends with all that is
   contained there. There is little `logic' here. It takes faith and
   trust, becoming familiar with the reality of Dharma practice - which
   is the willingness to surrender our profound attachment to the self
   that imprisons us in our head and creates the restlessness that
   prevents quiet meditation being possible. Devotional practice allows
   us to start that process of becoming whole. By combining this with
   your developing ethical stability and skilful means born of
   self-awareness, you will be transforming the emotional and mental
   restlessness that prevents you from sitting now. You will be laying
   the foundation for a fruitful sitting practice in the near future.

   <p>Q. Would you agree with the view that buying meat and fish are the
   same as eating something that has been killed for you - meat and fish
   are made available for consumers. If you buy it and eat it then all
   that you have done is avoided the messy business of killing by paying
   an anonymous person to do the work for you. So, doesn't buying meat
   and fish amount in practice to the killing?

   <p>A. The Buddha wasn't a vegetarian, nor were his vast sangha, including
   countless arhants who, like the Buddha, had finished their training
   and gone beyond the creation of karma, reaching the pureness of
   thought, word and action. The numerous traditions that sprang up in
   the East over more than two thousand years since the Buddha have never
   been vegetarian, and I don't recall any of the prominent saints and
   sages of Buddhism saying that to follow the Dharma you must be
   vegetarian. To suggest, as many do, in the West that the first precept
   is violated by eating meat is to suggest that all those who have
   practised traditional Buddhism, including the Buddha and the arhants,
   have been in violation of the first precept. I can best suggest you
   read the recent post concerning vegetarianism for my general view on
   the subject.

   <p>If you wish to create a 'moral' view for vegetarianism (or anything
   else), then it should be based first on the cultural background, and
   always be a personal view for you alone. Do remember, there will be
   many sincere spiritual people, and many fine human beings that don't
   have a spiritual path, who will disagree with whatever new ideas you
   come up with. That's why if you really seek guidance as to what is
   right and wrong it is best to stay with `rules' that are part of the
   natural laws that govern nature, which are always conditioned by the
   laws of karma.

   <p>If we decide to set up new ideas and propagate them in the name of
   Buddhist morality, we will be setting up a duality, which will always
   create problems. This will inevitably bring conflict with those who
   disagree, thus violating the basic spirit of Buddhism, which is to
   accept things the way they are. Remember, never has there been a
   conflict in the name of Buddhism in 2500 years; do you think that fine
   record is in place through mere luck?
