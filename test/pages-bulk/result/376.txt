                                <l>Wansong Xingxiu Zenji (1166-1246CE China)



   <p>Many years ago I was ordained a Zen monk. Entering the small monastery
   in rural Japan, where I still live, provided the form and direction to
   the spiritual quest which had been developing since my youth. In 1986,
   ten years after having entered the monastery, I first came in contact
   with the Alexander Technique and immediately noticed parallels between
    it and Zen. Since then I have often reflected on those similarities
   and in the context of spirituality and Alexander discoveries, I would
                  like to share a few of my observations.

    <p>Spirituality has been an important component in the lives of men and
    women since the dawn of human history. Religion did not arise simply
      because people wanted to appease powerful forces. It helped them
    relate to their environment and ground themselves in it. Primarily,
       though, religion has been the means to explain the tragedy and
       suffering of this beautiful, yet terrifying world. Through the
   thousands and thousands of years of human existence, spirituality has
    constantly changed and adapted. Religion has shown itself to be very
       pragmatic. When one idea of God or gods ceases to work, it is
     discarded in favour of another. Although the West in the twentieth
     century is often characterised by its secular belief in humanism,
     there is now growing interest in the nontheistic religions of the
   East, particularly Buddhism. Perhaps the two main reasons for this are
    the teaching that everything is one unity, together with the living
    tradition of practising under a teacher and personally experiencing
                             this for oneself.

    <p>In my own case, I was drawn to Zen because of a deep question about
   how a person ought to live. How, I wondered, could one person possibly
    bring about any change in the immense problems which face the world:
   war, poverty, various forms of discrimination, the destruction of the
   environment and so on. Like many who came of age in the 1960's, I was
       seeking an alternative to the materialistic lifestyle which we
     perceived to be the main cause of these problems. However, in the
      course of seeking, reflecting, and asking what could be done to
   resolve these problems, I realised that in order to change the world I
    had to change myself. I saw that the root cause of all suffering is
   the greed, anger, and folly arising from the ego-self. Zen seemed the
     most direct and down-to-earth practice to achieve freedom from an
    egocentric viewpoint. Once that liberation is realised it would then
    be possible to 'return to the marketplace' to aid in imparting that
    peace and freedom to others. To die and be reborn in this manner is
   certainly no easy task, and many years have passed since I began this
   journey. Yet I am still very much dedicated to this way of liberation.

   <p>The Alexander work came into my life at a time when I was having much
    difficulty with pain in my lower back. In fact it seemed that if the
     condition did not improve I would have to quit sitting through the
   long retreats of intensive zazen which we have several times a year in
     the monastery where I live. Very fortunately the person who was to
        become my main Alexander teacher came to live with us at the
       monastery. Largely through her great generosity, patience and
    dedication I was able to overcome my back problem. This is no small
    feat as I am a tall (196cm), thin (70kg) man with a scoliosis of the
    spine, living in an environment constructed for people who are much,
     much shorter. In more ways than one, my health has been seriously
   affected by the strain of misusing my body. Now, though, in large part
             thanks to the Alexander work, I am in good health.

     <p>It would be fun simply to write about the challenges I have faced
    living in the monastery: short handles on everything from brooms to
   shovels, low sinks, extremely low thresholds, long periods of sitting
      and standing still and so on. However, as I must be as brief as
              possible, I will confine myself to the topic of
   spirituality--specifically Zen--and the Alexander Technique, a subject
                      which could easily fill a book.

      <p>There is a deep religious aspect to the Alexander work which is
   perhaps often overlooked, namely trust or belief. Alexander is praised
   for the highly scientific approach he took--both in the way he found,
      and applied, his discovery. However, there is not as great a gap
             between science and religion as we tend to think.

     <p>Science demands the fundamental belief that there is a rational
     explanation for everything, it also requires an imagination and
     courage which are not dissimilar to religious creativity ... A
     truly creative philosopher or scientist, has like the mystic to
     confront the dark world of uncreated reality and the cloud of
     unknowing in the hope of piercing it.1

      <p>Albert Einstein, commenting on the relation between religion and
                               science, said:

     <p>To know what is impenetrable to us really exists, manifesting
     itself to us as the highest wisdom and the most radiant beauty,
     which our dull faculties can comprehend only in their most
     primitive forms--this knowledge, this feeling is at the centre of
     all true religiousness.2

     <p>Alexander clearly documented the critical point in his study that
         would enable him to pass from the 'known to the unknown.'

     <p>I now saw that if I was ever to succeed in making the changes in
     use I desired, I must subject the processes directing my use to a
     new experience, that is of being dominated by reasoning instead of
     feeling. This meant that I must be prepared to carry on with any
     procedure I had reasoned out as best for my purpose, even though
     that procedure might feel wrong. In other words, my trust in my
     reasoning process to bring me safely to my 'end' must be a genuine
     trust, not a half-trust needing the assurance of feeling right as
     well.3

   <p>From the point of view of Zen, there are two interesting points in all
      of this (I should say that while Zen is a religion, it is also a
   rigorous study of reality and, more specifically, the self). First of
     all, the idea that science can rationally explain everything is a
   belief. It is a belief that modern man has nearly substituted for the
    belief in God. Yet explanation, no matter how precise, can never be
    the reality itself. Say the word 'fire,' for example. Why doesn't it
     burn your mouth? Say the word 'water.' Why doesn't it quench your
      thirst? In these simple examples, we can see that descriptions,
    whether they be words, picture images or thoughts, are not the thing
   itself. Consequently, it is one of the axioms, not only of Zen but of
   other mystic traditions as well, that reality itself is fundamentally
   unknowable. In this way it is possible to use reason to see the limits
   of the intellect and to understand that it must be transcended, but to
                become reality itself requires great belief.

                         <p>"If only we could realise

                          that everything is one!"
     _________________________________________________________________

    <p>The second important point in this connection is that faith or trust
     implies doubt. No one believes that the sky is blue, that water is
       wet, or that salt is salty. These truths are self-evident. For
     Alexander the question at the centre of his doubt was: 'What am I
   doing to myself to cause my difficulties?' This doubt was an essential
    factor, in combination with his faith in reasoning, in fostering the
        determination necessary to find a resolution to his problem.

      <p>In Zen there is a similar process. Without genuine belief in the
      Buddhist teaching that all beings are essentially in a state of
      liberation as-they-are, we will always look outside the present
   moment. It is precisely the doubt that we personally have not realised
        this liberation, together with the faith that we already are
   liberated, which will motivate us to actually make it our own. What is
     amazing is that Alexander accomplished this without a teacher, but
     then so did Shakyamuni Buddha. For those of us following in their
    footsteps, it makes it that much easier. Yet it is necessary that we
   also do what they did. As Alexander put it so succinctly--if you will
    do what I did, you will be able to do what I do. If we can truly do
   what they did, it becomes our own, at which point reason and faith are
    no longer necessary. What is the practice required for making their
         realisations our own? There are some intriguing parallels.

   <p>Zen is the direct realisation of the oneness of all things. In a word,
        it is to forget the ego-self which is the source of all such
   distinctions as right and wrong, likes and dislikes, you and me, life
    and death. There is a well known Zen story of a monk named Joshu who
    asked his master, "What is the Way?" He wanted to know the means by
       which he could attain true peace and freedom. His master said,
    "Everyday mind is the Way." Each activity in our life, from morning
    till evening, is the Way itself. Joshu was not satisfied though. He
     was not interested in mere intellectual understanding. So he asked
   again, "What sort of practice can I do in order to truly realise that
    everyday mind is the Way?" The master replied, "If you look for it,
   you'll only go in the wrong direction." Practice with the intention of
    trying to understand 'everyday mind' will only separate you from it
       further. Joshu was getting more and more confused and somewhat
       desperately asked, "But if I don't do anything, how can I ever
   understand the Way?!" His master said, "The Way is neither knowing nor
    not knowing. Knowing is delusion, not knowing is indifference. When
    you have reached the true Way beyond doubt, you will find it as vast
   and boundless as outer space. How can it be talked about on the level
        of right and wrong?" With these words, Joshu attained sudden
   realisation. The important point of this story is that true liberation
      is neither in intellectual understanding nor in shrugging it off
                               indifferently.

   <p>Human beings can only think of the past and the future. Once something
   is perceived it is already past. For this reason, the moment 'now' is
    unknowable. It is beyond knowing and not knowing. It is beyond right
      and wrong, profit and loss, enlightenment and delusion, life and
    death. In a word, it is the timeless, eternal reality which mystics
   and scientists struggle to apprehend. Yet since it is unthinkable (the
    Unthinkable), it precedes consciousness and so it is also of course
                            beyond apprehension.

    <p>Many people assume that if all evil could somehow be eradicated only
     good would remain. But this is impossible. Good and evil can only
   exist in opposition to each other. This has great significance for the
       Alexander work. Alexander clearly saw the problem arising from
   knowing. "You can't do what you don't know, if you keep doing what you
     do know."5 If we can simply give up the desire to be right, then,
    wrong immediately disappears and we are left with the present moment
                       which is empty of either one.

      <p>No one can think two thoughts at the same time. It simply is not
   possible to think of being right and being wrong at the same time. One
    thought must disappear before another can arise. This one thought is
      the unknowable 'now.' By perceiving 'me', the ego consciousness
     divides one thing into two: past and future, you and me, right and
   wrong. We are constantly choosing between what we like and what we do
        not. Yet these are merely ideas, they do not actually exist.

    <p>'Endgaining' is the term Alexander gave to the unconscious tendency
    for people to become fixated on the result of a process, rather than
     paying attention to the means by which it is attained. It was his
     genius to describe how the habit of wanting to do what feels right
   comes from our deep-seated fear of being wrong and making mistakes. In
     Zen, we have a remarkably similar term, 'seeking mind.' This is a
     condition of constantly seeking outside the present moment. We are
    exceedingly insecure, for example, if we do not know. Continually we
    want more information and more experience to prove that we do know.
       The problem is that one answer is simply the seed for the next
   question--a never ending cycle of illusion. In Zen we say "take a step
    off a 100 foot pole." To truly awaken to the nature of reality it is
    necessary to let go of what we know and what we do not know. A great
   leap of faith is required to take us from the 'known to the unknown.'

   <p>A corollary to this is Alexander's discovery that he only had to think
    of reciting and it would affect the physical use of his body. He was
    one of the first Westerners, at least in the modern age, to realise
     that mind and body are one. This is a teaching, though, which has
    existed in Buddhism for 2500 years. In Zen we are taught to see with
   the whole body, likewise to hear - smell - taste - feel and think with
        the whole body. We are assured that if we practice this way
   single-mindedly we will attain satori, liberation from the illusion of
                                   self.

    <p>The six sense functions (including thinking) work automatically. No
   one has ever had to train themselves in order to see or hear or smell.
     Moreover, there is no central organising function (self) within us
   which controls us. For example, if the eyes are open, there is nothing
     inside of us which can give the order not to see. If the eyes are
     open, there is seeing. Even if we have never seen a certain object
     before, we can recognise it instantly. Likewise with the ears. No
     matter how many sounds we might hear at one time, they do not get
    jumbled up into one noise. There is nothing more mysterious than the
      powers of these sense functions. We do not even really know what
                     thought is or where it is located.

   <p>This brings us back to the fact that we can only think one thought at
     a time. One thought must disappear before another can arise. This
   includes the thought of 'me.' To think "I am seeing such and such" is,
   in fact, two thoughts. Consequently the significance of mind and body
    being one unity is that when there is seeing, it isn't me who sees,
    but rather that there is only seeing, no seer and nothing seen. When
      there is thinking, there is only thought, no thinker and nothing
    thought of. This is our reality now, moment to moment. It means that
                  we are always one with our environment.

     <p>Human beings are aware that something is wrong with their
     condition; they feel at odds with themselves and others, out of
     touch with their inner nature and disoriented. Conflict and a lack
     of sympathy seem to characterise our existence. Yet we are
     constantly seeking to unite the multiplicity of phenomena and
     reduce them to some ordered whole. 4 

     <p>If only we could realise that everything is one! That each moment
                as-it-is is the result which we are seeking!

   <p>Astronomers estimate that the Milky Way with its hundreds of billions
    of stars is revolving at the speed of 500,000 miles per hour around
    its centre. At the molecular level, biologists tells us that 98% of
     the atoms in the human body are replaced in less than one year and
   that within the span of four years every single atom of the human body
    is replaced at least once. Yet no one is conscious of these facts in
   their everyday life. In the same way no one is aware of the extremely
   high rate of speed at which thought arises. In the Buddhist teaching,
   there are said to be thousands of changes per second, a constant flux
     of change. While it is not possible to change that reality, it is
    possible to stop interfering with it by trying to use it for our own
     illusory advantage. This brings us to the correlation between the
                    'non-doing' of inhibition and zazen.
     _________________________________________________________________

                        <p>"Once something is perceived

                    it is already past. For this reason

                      the moment now is unknowable." 
     _________________________________________________________________

    <p>Central to the teaching of Buddhism is the law of cause and effect.
    Past causes have created the present result. The present result will
    be the cause of future results. My Zen master always says that if we
    want to know our condition five, ten or even twenty years from now,
    all we have to do is look at our condition now. Each time we put off
    something we know we ought to do, we create the stimulus for putting
   it off again. Conversely, each time we withhold consent to react in a
       habitual manner, we break a link in the chain which binds us.

    <p>In other words, if you want to change your life, you must do it now.
     Essentially the greatest change we can make is to give up seeking
   results elsewhere and simply accept our reality as it is now. Zazen is
   the practice of abandoning ourselves to the present moment. If we can
       let go of our opinions and ideas in the form of expectations,
     intentions, and desire for meaning, we can see that each moment is
   exactly what we are seeking, even if we are anxious or confused. This
   also includes, of course, reflecting on the past and planning for the
       future, yet with the detachment of knowing that there is never
                   anything other than the moment 'now.'

    <p>Alexander discovered in the course of seeking for a solution to his
   vocal problem that it was necessary at the critical moment to inhibit
    his habitual response of 'doing' what felt right. This was the first
   step. Others have since called this 'letting yourself be.' By stopping
       the unconscious tendency to depend on his habitual feelings of
      rightness, he could go on to the second step. This was to give a
     series of reasoned-out guiding orders. In this way he was able to
   achieve his end not by doing it, but by allowing it to happen. He had
   realised that mind and body are one. By resisting the impulse to 'do'
   and then projecting through thought the appropriate directions, he was
   able to give himself a new experience. Later he always emphasised that
   by withholding consent to do what feels right, the ends would come of
                                themselves.

   <p>In Zen, the Buddhist teaching serves the purpose of guiding orders or
   directions. In fact we refer to the teaching as 'a finger pointing at
    the moon.' The 'moon' is liberation, awakening to the true nature of
    the self. The teachings of impermanence, no-self, and the timeless,
      tranquil nature of the unknowable moment 'now', all point to the
   necessity of forgetting the ego-self. The precepts and the Bodhisattva
   vows, on one hand, and the practice of zazen on the other, provide the
    means whereby to attain it. In any case, it is the moon which is the
   goal and not the finger. As in the Alexander work, inevitably there is
      a tendency at the beginning to 'do' the practice of directions.
   However, with time and perseverance, together with a skilful teacher,
      the habit of 'doing' will give way to 'just being.' This is the
   ability to devote ourselves completely to each task simply for its own
        sake. No longer is there finger or moon, for we realise that
   essentially moon and finger are one. We are then free to work 100% for
                       the sake of all living beings.

  <p>It is not my intention to say that Zen and the Alexander Technique are
   the same. Certainly different people will view them in different ways.
   Perhaps many will think I am trying to compare two things which are on
   completely different levels. However, I do think that for some people
      they can be compatible practices and even be complementary in a
   beneficial manner. Alexander did speak of religion in a way strikingly
                        similar to Zen when he said:

     <p>The essence of the religious outlook is that religion should not be
     kept in a compartment by itself, but that it should be the ever
     present guiding principle of life underlying the "daily round", the
     "common task". So also it is possible to apply this principle of
     life in the daily round of one's activities without involving a
     loss of attention in these activities.5

                    <p>This is the way of 'everyday mind'.

     <p>Zen is the practice and realisation of transcending the dualism of
     self-and-other through attention to all activities in our everyday
     life. Many people associate Zen with a certain posture of sitting
   cross-legged, but this is merely a position of 'mechanical advantage.'
      This would be akin to thinking that the 'monkey position' is the
   Alexander Technique. In fact, zazen is not meditation. Zazen is zazen.
       It is both the end as well as the means by which to forget the
   distinction between self and meditation. In this connection, Alexander
                     was possibly right when he wrote:

     <p>You see, a person cannot capitulate to subconscious guidance to the
     extent which 'meditation' demands in practice, without seriously
     affecting the psychophysical self in reaction to living.6

   <p>Zen is to forget the self whether sitting still or in activity. Zen is
   to breathe with the whole body, to work, laugh, play, and cry with the
   whole body. Yet to truly make that our own and not simply get stuck in
             intellectual understanding requires great effort.

       <p>As we approach the end of the twentieth century, the world is
      undergoing tremendous change. There is a wide array of extremely
       serious problems facing human life on this planet--widespread
    destruction of the environment, overpopulation, AIDS, severe famine
   and poverty, unprecedented crime and violence. What will be the future
      role of spirituality? Can the Alexander work provide a spiritual
     discipline to help us face these problems? Towards the end of his
   life, Alexander said, "After working for a lifetime in this new field,
   I am conscious that the knowledge gained is but a beginning." He knew
   that the "knowledge of the self is fundamental to all other." What new
    horizons are there for the Alexander work? Can it provide the means
     whereby people can learn to stop the increasing greed for instant
   gratification, for our constant desire to know that we are right? Can
                it truly enhance the knowledge of the self?

      <p>For me it is clear that Alexander put his finger directly on the
    problem when he said, "You want to feel out whether you are right or
   not. I am giving you a conception to eradicate that. I don't want you
     to care a damn if you're right or not. Directly you don't care if
           you're right or not, the impeding obstacle is gone."7

             <p>That obstacle is nothing other than the ego-self.

    <p>Daigaku Rumme was born in Mason City, Iowa, USA in 1950. His father
     was sent as a missionary to Japan in 1961 where he lived until he
   returned to Iowa for college. He graduated in 1972, as, he writes: "a
    properly dis-illusioned young man. I was unable to think of any sort
   of occupation which seemed mean-ingful, plus I wanted to do something
     that would change the world, not just be part of the status quo."

   <p>At that time he came across a copy of Shunryu Suzuki's book Zen Mind,
   Beginner's Mind and eventually, in 1976, decided to enter Hosshinji, a
     Japanese Zen Monastery. He ordained as a monk two years later, in
                                   1978.

    <p>While living in Japan, and in return trips to the States, he he has
    taken hundreds of Alexander lessons with many different teachers. He
   continues living at the monastery--meditating, studying and acting as
    a translator for his revered spiritual master, Sekkei Harada Roshi.
