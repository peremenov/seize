<h>U. of Illinois Adopts Dissection-Alternatives Policy!

   <p>March 7, 2005: Virgina Commonwealth University just passed a
   student-choice policy that gives students with ethical or religious
   objections to dissection the opportunity to earn either a Bachelor of
   Arts or a Bachelor of Science degree without participating in academic
   exercises they find objectionable! Read the full story here. For more
   information about this important victory, you can contact Nicole Green
   (Assistant Director of Education, Animalearn) at (215)887-0816, or
   April Kung (the Virginia Commonwealth University Student who
   spearheaded the campaign) at (804)358-2829. Congratulations!

   <p>February 3, 2005: While we do not have a list of every class using
   animals, it appears that at least some classes in the timetable now
   indicate both whether or not a course includes dissection and whether
   or not alternatives are available. For example, Biology of
   Reproduction has alternatives available for all dissection
   requirements. It appears that once the emotions died down from the
   original controversy, professors and department heads were more
   willing to make some accomodations quietly!
   In other news, April Kung at Virginia Commonwealth University is
   working on a student chocie policy at her school. We've added a link
   to the presentation that she delivered to her department on our
   Resources page.

   <p>August 18, 2004: The timetable has been updated to include whether or
   not a course includes dissection, but still doesn't indicate whether
   or not alternatives will be available as mandated by Recommendation 4
   of the policy. We have also found that department heads are unwilling
   to have us demonstrate alternatives to them because they feel the
   issue is too controversial for them to even discuss them with their
   professors. We hope to find professors willing to take a closer look
   at the alternatives, and to continue support of students struggling
   with this issue. Also, the effect of this policy is supposed to be up
   for review by the senate this fall; since it hasn't been fully
   implemented until now I don't imagine any changes being made but we'll
   keep an eye on it.

   <p>December 18, 2003: The school of integrative biology (SIB) here at
   UIUC has responded to our question about why the policy wasn't being
   implemented. Apparently things like the timetable and program of study
   are made up far in advance, so the first ones in compliance will be in
   Fall 2004. They made a change to their website so that the
   undergraduate program page now has a page discussing dissection in
   SIB. Finally, when asked why a student in BIOL 104 was allowed not to
   dissect, but not permitted to leave and/or use alternatives, they said
   that since it's considered a specialty course under the policy,
   professors don't have to offer alternatives. While this is correct, it
   seems that both students and teachers would prefer having the students
   learn as much as possible, so we are going to get some alternatives on
   loan and demonstrate them to people in the SIB. It is our hope that
   once professors see the alternatives they will agree that they're
   worth bringing into the classroom.
   <p>In other news, you can see an article about our campaign in the latest
   issue of AV magazine (from the American Anti-Vivisection Society).
   It's not online yet, but you can see the magazine's web page here.

   <p>November 23, 2003: This web page was initially designed to aid
   Students Improving the Lives of Animals (SILA) in getting a policy
   passed to allow students to use alternatives to dissection at the
   University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. However, now that the
   policy has been passed we would like it to serve as a resource for
   other groups working on similar policies, and for individual students
   affected by this issue. We hope to continue to add content to the
   page; if there's something you think we're missing please send us an
   email. Please feel free to use and modify materials from this website
   in your own campaigns, and let us know what you found useful! Also,
   while the policy is now official, it has come to our attention that
   thus far it has not been implemented. We are continuing to work with
   the administration to address this problem; if you have an experience
   with dissection or dissection alternatives at UIUC please let us know.

   <p>May 5, 2003: The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Senate voted
   today to adopt a dissection alternatives policy, the first of its kind
   at a major U.S. university. The policy marks the climax of a two-year
   student campaign and represents a compromise between student and
   faculty interests.

   <p>Among the policy's provisions, general education courses that require
   students to engage in animal dissection must make alternatives
   available to all students who request them. For other courses,
   instructors are required to notify students of the availability of
   alternatives at the time of registration. The timetable is also
   supposed to have information on dissection and alternatives for
   relevant classes. Students who believe they have been unfairly denied
   an alternative may appeal under UIUC's "Grievance Procedures in
   Matters of Religious Beliefs, Observances, and Practices. Finally, the
   Programs of Study document and departmental web pages are supposed to
   be updated to include information on alternatives to dissection."

   <p>We are very grateful for the efforts of concerned students, faculty,
   senators, and administrators. We also thank James Cromwell, Kevin
   Nealon, and Linda Blair for their support.

   <p>Please write Chancellor Nancy Cantor and thank her for overseeing the
   creation of the first campus-wide dissection-alternatives policy at a
   major US university!
