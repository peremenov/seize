     <h>Does it matter who divorces whom?

     <p>There are some disadvantages in being the one who is divorced.
     Firstly, you can be ordered to pay the legal fees for the divorce;
     this may seem (and often is) extremely unfair, a case of adding
     injury to insult. This is based on the old principle in the courts
     that if you prove your case then you get your costs, despite the
     fact that it is not always appropriate in the family justice
     system. However, if the practicalities of the actual divorce are
     agreed by both parties, it is also possible to agree that the two
     of you will share the legal fees between you, or indeed that the
     person who actually files the petition will not seek an order for
     costs against the spouse.

     <p>Secondly, you may have the unpleasantness of being on the receiving
     end of some legal description of your private life, especially if
     the divorce is based on unreasonable behaviour. It is possible to
     file an Answer to the allegations and try to regain control of the
     process by forcing a compromise on the allegations made, but most
     prefer to avoid the legal complications and significant expense of
     doing so. Nevertheless, allegations made as to unreasonable
     behaviour do often stick in the gullet as the contents of the
     Petition rarely have much to do with why the marriage broke down.

     <p>But who petitions against whom rarely spills over in to other more
     important areas, such as the children or finance. It is worth just
     checking that none of the allegations in the Petition relate to
     dealing with the children or to financial issues, since once the
     divorce is granted, those allegations become a finding of fact.
     Unless it is specifically agreed beforehand, these findings can be
     referred to in linked proceedings.

     <p>The usual way of preventing such difficulties - and much acrimony
     too - is to offer the Petition in draft before it is sent to the
     court. Any items that cause particular upset can be discussed and
     either watered down or left out. This is not something that
     everyone has to do, but is very much in the spirit of the SFLA Code
     of Practice.

     <p>An early discussion with an SFLA solicitor can help resolve some of
     these issues.

       
       ______________________________________________________________

     <h>Is there going to be a new law of divorce?

     <p>The Family Law Act 1996 was passed in a fanfare, hailed as going
     some way towards removing acrimony in the divorce process by
     getting rid of the concept of 'fault'. However, the Government has
     since announced that those parts of the Act dealing with divorce
     will not now come into force.

     <p>We are, unfortunately, left with the present system for the
     foreseeable future.


       ______________________________________________________________

     <h>Which court does it have to be in?

     <p>If the divorce is going to take place in England and Wales, it is
     possible to get any County Court that is empowered to deal with
     divorce to issue proceedings.

     <p>It is usual to use your local court for convenience's sake. Some
     use a court that is out of their area for fear of coming into
     contact with people they know in the local context (Mrs Simpson
     used Ipswich!). The Principal Registry in London is used by many
     who do not live there, for a mixture of all of these reasons or
     perhaps they believe that that court will handle their case better.

     <p>Practices and judicial attitudes vary from court to court.
     Experienced solicitors with knowledge of the system sometimes
     choose a particular court for a particular case, to try and gain
     some advantage for their client.

     <p>But for the vast majority of cases it is convenience that is the
     deciding factor - convenience for the solicitors particularly,
     since they will charge for their travel time to court. In any event
     courts have the power to order cases to be transferred to the court
     that is most appropriate - in the view of the judge rather than
     anyone else.

        
       ______________________________________________________________

     <h>Do children automatically live with their mother?

     <p>Married parents share joint parental responsibility and come before
     the Court as equals. The children's welfare is the court's
     paramount consideration.

     <p>If there is a dispute as to with which parent the children should
     live, one or other of them must issue an application for a
     Residence Order. In considering which parent is best able to meet
     the child's best interests, the Court will apply the "welfare
     checklist" (s1(3) Children Act 1989).

     <p>The application of the Welfare Checklist points towards pragmatism:
     <p>* Who is best able to meet the child's day to day needs?
     <p>* What has the domestic routine been in the child's life to date?
     <p>* Even if there is little to choose between the two parents in terms
       of their actual parenting skills, are the work commitments of one
       more conducive to having primary care of the children? This last
       consideration is often fundamental and traditionally, has tended
       to work in favour of mothers, but increasingly, this need not
       necessarily be the case.
     <p>* Even where one parent does have a Residence Order in his or her
       favour, that does not alter the fact that the other parent retains
       parental responsibility and has an important role to play in the
       child's life. In theory at least, a Residence Order is not a
       passport to making important decisions about the child's
       upbringing on a unilateral basis.
     <p>* In the case of unmarried parents, the mother has sole parental
       responsibility until the father acquires it by way of an
       agreement, or Court Order. He will however be granted parental
       responsibility automatically if he has a Residence Order in his
       favour.
     <p>* In the case of very young children, it is a fact that courts tend
       to assume they are better off living with their mother unless
       clearly shown to the contrary. Nevertheless, there is no
       presumption of law and the courts have to consider each case on
       its individual merits. Although the odds may seem stacked against
       a father, the facts may mean that this is not necessarily the
       case.

      
       ______________________________________________________________

     <h>Is a 50/50 split the usual financial settlement?

     <p>Recent cases concerning 'big money' - where the assets available
     for division clearly exceed the parties' needs - have focused on
     the concept of equality of outcome. This may or may not mean that
     the assets are divided 50/50 in these cases. What it does mean is
     that contributions to the running of the home and the bringing up
     of children are valued equally by the court on divorce to
     contributions made by economically rewarding work. There may be
     other considerations - for example, the liquidity of the assets
     making up the family pot, or any inheritances received, or
     particularly bad financial conduct on one side, which dictate that
     the outcome should not be equal. Fairness is the key - and a 50/50
     split will not be fair in all cases.
     Each case has to be looked at individually. It depends on the
     circumstances of those involved.

     <p>In most cases, the financial settlement will reflect what each
     person needs fundamentally, money to pay all the bills and to sort
     out somewhere to live.

     <p>Having an equal split is sometimes the starting point, but a lot of
     other factors have to be taken into account.

     <p>See the section on FINANCE for more details. This explains how the
     law works.

     <p>The great strength of the law is that it is flexible enough to
     treat each family differently. But that does make it difficult to
     work out what is right for you.

     <p>We recommend that you consult a solicitor about your own case - to
     see what the likely outcomes might be.

      
       ______________________________________________________________

     <h>Should I close my joint account?

     <p>Many couples do not make any changes to their banking arrangements
     until financial negotiations are well advanced.

     <p>But if there is a risk that large sums may be drawn out - or if
     there is a risk that credit or charge cards may be used
     inappropriately - then it may be safer to take action to prevent
     this.

     <p>The danger is that if an account or credit card is suddenly frozen,
     solicitors may be involved immediately to ask for maintenance
     arrangements to be set up - perhaps through the courts.

     <p>Much depends on whether you can trust each other enough to leave
     things as they are.

     <p>If you need to rearrange the accounts on separation we recommend
     that you try to agree those changes first. Think about mediation.

     <p>If you have concerns about this area then consult a solicitor.

             
       ______________________________________________________________

     <h>What happens to my house if I die?

     <p>You need to check the way in which your home is owned. Is it in
     your sole name? If it is, it will pass under the terms of your will
     or intestacy.
     There are two ways of owning a home jointly - as equitable joint
     tenants, or as tenants-in-common.
     Many couples own their home as joint tenants, which means in such a
     way that if one of them dies, the other owns the property outright
     automatically.

     <p>This arrangement may still be the right one after separation - at
     least for the time being.

     <p>It is possible though to change the way in which you own any
     property jointly - so that if one of you dies then his or her share
     passes to their estate and is then dealt with under their will i.e.
     to set up a tenancy-in-common. This is called severing the joint
     tenancy by giving a formal Notice of Severance to the other joint
     owner.

     <p>Your solicitor can prepare this for you. You should always take
     advice on this point because it may lead to claims against your
     estate if you die.

     <p>It may be helpful to prepare a new will early on - even if this is
     only a temporary measure.

     <p>The decree absolute of divorce automatically alters your will in so
     far as it relates to the other spouse. It is important to consider
     changing your will at that stage in any event.

       
       ______________________________________________________________

     <h>What happens to the children if I die?

     <p>Where both parents have parental responsibility, in the event of
     the death of one, the surviving parent will retain sole parental
     responsibility.

     <p>The exception to this is where the parent who died had a Residence
     Order in his or her favour, in which case, any guardian appointed
     in the deceased parents Will will automatically assume Parental
     Responsibility in tandem with the surviving parent.

     <p>If there is a dispute between those with parental responsibility as
     to with whom a child should live in the event of the death of his
     or her primary carer, then an application for a Residence Order
     needs to be made to the Court who will then determine with whom the
     child should live.

          
       ______________________________________________________________

     <h>Can I change my child's surname?

     <p>Neither parent, nor indeed any other person, can change a child's
     surname without the written consent of every person with parental
     responsibility or the leave of the Court. Even in cases where the
     parents are unmarried, the Court has suggested that such a step
     should generally not be taken without either the other parent's
     agreement or a court decision. Changing a child's surname is
     obviously a very emotive step, since the surname may provide an
     important link to the parent with whom the child does not normally
     live; it may also express a preference to be known as the child of
     the step-parent.

     <p>The Court will not consider it appropriate to change a child's
     surname just because it is different to that of their
     half-or-step-siblings, nor even simply because the child wants it
     changed. The Court will not sanction a change in surname lightly;
     there is a presumption in favour of the status quo.

     <p>Increasingly, children may be part of a step-family in which
     children do not all share the same surname. It is therefore
     important that any such proposal is very carefully thought through
     and justifiable on quite strict grounds, such as where there is no
     ongoing relationship whatsoever with the other biological parent
     and so to retain that name causes distress and confusion.

     <p>The uppermost consideration for the Court in considering whether a
     change of surname is appropriate is the child's welfare and best
     interests. It is everything to do with the rights of the child and
     nothing to do with any asserted parental rights. How those best
     interests are met will depend upon balancing a range of factors
     including:
     <l>* the original surname with which the child was registered and
       whether all the circumstances justify such a change (ie. is there
       a good enough reason?);
     <l>* whether the change of name has already happened and how long ago;
     <l>* the age of the child involved and whether he or she is deemed
       competent to understand the complexity of issues arising;
     <l>* the need to preserve a link between the child and the
       non-residential parent, regardless of contact arrangements;
     <l>* whether the reaction of either parent to the decision and any
       consequences would cause practical detriment to the child;
     <l>* the strength of the child's connection with the current surname.

     <p>In certain instances the Court has made a distinction between a
     child's "official" name and the name by which the child chooses to
     be known; this to be particularly relevant with an older child,
     although the parents themselves would be obliged not to cause them
     to be known by anything other than the official name. However, in
     another case involving teenage children the Court decided that the
     father's surname should be kept in the face of opposition from the
     children and in circumstances where no contact was taking place in
     order to underline the importance of the paternal link.

     <p>Inevitably, the issue continues to be a difficult and highly
     emotionally-charged one to resolve, but one in which the Court
     considers it important enough to be involved where the parents
     cannot agree.

        
       ______________________________________________________________

      <h>How can I keep my legal fees down?

     <p>Solicitors usually charge for their time - the more of their time
     you use up, the more they cost.

     <p>Here are some tips for keeping fees down:
     <p>* Use this site and tell your family about it!
     <p>* Don't talk to your solicitor about emotional problems - there are
       better qualified people to help with those who cost less.
       Solicitors will be sympathetic and may need to know some
       background but their skills are different.
     <p>* Use mediation to sort out as much as possible - your solicitor has
       a vital role to play even if you mediate, but you may be able to
       sort out a lot of issues yourselves - and certainly a lot of the
       financial disclosure.
     <p>* Use a check-list of things you want to ask - you will be charged
       for each call you make, so be sure beforehand that you know all
       the things you want to ask about - you will save on the additional
       calls.
     <p>* Keep a file (somewhere safe) of all your solicitor's letters and
       documents in an organized format. It is important that you can
       keep track of the advice you have had, and you are likely to have
       to refer to what has been sent to you. Some of your queries may
       already have been answered.
     <p>* Keep a file of all your bank , credit card and charge card
       statements - and the rest of your financial information. One of
       the expensive tasks your solicitor may well have to do is examine
       your financial position; if this is in chaos you will be paying
       for your solicitor to prepare details of your outgoings, your
       mortgage and life assurance, your pensions and so on.
     <p>* Fill in as much as you can of our Financial Checklist - you will
       find this under Finance, in particular the section Practical
       Steps.
     <p>* Don't bother your solicitor with less important things which could
       be done by a secretary - if it is anything other than advice, then
       ask a secretary who is involved, for confirmation of dates or
       appointments, copy documents etc.
