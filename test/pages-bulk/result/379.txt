   <p>Believe it or not, the concept of "Common Law Marriage" is still alive
   and kicking in the State of Colorado! The fact is, many people are
   tripped up when the legal ramifications of this relic in the law rears
   its ugly head. Here are the "Top 10 Myths About Common Law Marriage":

   <p>Myth 1: If I am married by common law, it won√Çt affect my legal rights
   after a break-up, right?

     <p>Wrong. You could be subjected to the same claims for property
     division or maintenance (alimony), as you would face in a
     traditional divorce.

   <p>Myth 2: I can't be common law married unless I have been cohabitating
   for 10 years, right?

     <p>Wrong. There is no set time period under Colorado law to be
     declared common law married.

   <p>Myth 3: It doesn't matter if my friends and family think I am married,
   so long as I know the truth, right?

     <p>Wrong. In a legal dispute, count on your "ex" to claim otherwise
     and get all of his/her buddies to support that claim, especially if
     there is money involved. The key is whether you "hold yourself out"
     as married, and that vague term can get pretty expensive to legally
     prove, one way or the other.

   <p>Myth 4: If I have children with my significant other, I am
   automatically common law married, right?

     <p>Wrong. Not necessarily. The key is whether you hold yourself out as
     "husband" and "wife".

   <p>Myth 5: I told my insurance carrier that I am married so my
   boyfriend/girlfriend can get benefits. This isolated action can't hurt
   me, right?

     <p>Wrong. Any public declarations you make about your marital status
     can come back and hurt you later.

   <p>Myth 6: So what if I am considered common law married, I can simply
   "annul" the marriage, right?

     <p>Wrong. If you are held to be common law married, you will have to
     go through a full-blown dissolution of marriage proceeding.

  <p> Myth 7: I can't be common law married unless I have plans to go
   through with the ceremony, right?

    <p> Wrong. You may be considered common law married even if you and
     your significant other have never even considered "taking the
     plunge" publicly.

   <p>Myth 8: So what if I filed a joint tax return, that is a federal
   issue, and it can't be used against me in a state court, right?

     <p>Wrong. It can and almost definitely will be used against you by
     your ex's lawyer.

   <p>Myth 9: As long as my relationship with my ex-boyfriend/girlfriend
   stays strong, common law marriage doesn't matter to me, right?

     <p>Wrong. If you die unexpectedly, your significant other may be
     entitled to inherit your assets, potentially depriving your
     biological heirs of a lot of money.

   <p>Myth 10: Okay, so maybe I have a common law situation. I shouldn't
   have to worry about this unless my relationship is about to end,
   right?

     <p>Wrong. You should be as informed as possible about your rights, as
     there are almost always steps you can take to protect yourself. Be
     informed, be cautious, and be proactive!
