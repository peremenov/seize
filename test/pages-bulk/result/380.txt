     not necessarily reflect the views of D-Lib Magazine, its publisher,

   <p>Open access through author payment has clearly caught the attention of
   a wide audience. While I am not specifically advocating this
   initiative, it appears to have real merit and warrants careful
   examination and testing--a view I have not always held. However, I
   also believe it is counter-productive for author payment advocates to
   denigrate commercial publishers (and profit) and exclude them from the
   open access model. To do so diminishes the chance of success for the
   model in the long run. Rather than creating a divisive atmosphere
   among journal system participants, a more successful approach would be
   for all of them to join together to test the model. In the past
   commercial organizations such as online bibliographic vendors have
   made a tremendous contribution to science in partnership with
   non-profit and government database producers [1]. The commercial
   sector has made too many contributions to science to dismiss the
   sector as being irrelevant and basically self-serving. This article is
   to argue for cooperation and to consider experiments to determine the
   strengths and weaknesses of various approaches to open access by
   author payment.

   <p>Some have likened the need for open access to the journal literature
   to extensive open access to the mapping of the human genome. Dr. Mark
   Walport, Director of the Wellcome Trust (a major Human Genome Project
   contributor) is quoted as follows regarding journal open access: "The
   model of the Human Genome Project need not be unique, and it is the
   principle of free access that we want to champion" [2]. There is
   another side to the Human Genome phenomenon that is also akin to the
   current journal environment.

   <p>After the discovery of unique DNA patterns in 1984 and DNA sequencing
   in 1986, scientists gathered together to examine the possibility of
   sequencing the human genome and speculated that it would take 30 years
   and $3 billion to achieve this goal [2]. Even though some scientists
   objected because it might divert funds from useful research, the U.S.
   Congress began supporting the Human Genome Project (HGP) in 1990, and
   pieces of the mapping began in 16 international laboratories with a
   15-year timeline to finish. J. Craig Venter, a scientist at the
   National Institutes of Health suggested that advanced technologies be
   used to speed the process, but his idea was spurned. He then raised
   private sector capital to develop super computer programs and 300
   special processing machines that would considerably reduce the time
   and costs. He intended to sell the raw DNA product to pharmaceutical
   companies and universities. This approach outraged the public HGP
   scientists who believed that this information was a public good and
   should be freely available to anyone (using the Internet). It was
   generally recognized that the Public HGP needed the machines as well
   and, after much disagreement and vilification of Venter despite his
   considerable contribution, the machines were provided to the Public
   HGP at a cost of $300,000 per machine.

   <p>This led to an "arms race" between the Public HGP and Venter's
   company. While both sides wanted to achieve a common and worthwhile
   goal, both sides had potential motives that were not necessarily
   praiseworthy. President Clinton, seeing the counter-productive nature
   of the competition, got involved and brought in an arbitrator. Since
   neither side wanted to be seen in public together, the two leaders met
   in secret in the arbitrator's basement and worked out a compromise. A
   draft of a plan was co-announced at the White House in 2000, and later
   that year final results were cooperatively revealed. Some 4,000
   persons contributed to the project with positive results that
   demonstrated that public and private sectors can cooperate to achieve
   a common good. While the compromise was by no means perfect for either
   side of the controversy, science and humanity will surely benefit [3].
   An analogy to this story is that the hostility toward Venter and his
   company is similar to that directed by some toward commercial
   publishers. Even though arguments still linger concerning the genome
   technology, perhaps something can be learned by all journal system
   participants from this experience, which is that both the public and
   private sectors can contribute to the public good.

   <p>Author payment is not new. In the 1970s, a statistical sample of
   articles and a survey of their principal author showed that over half
   of all science articles written by U.S. authors required some form of
   author payment and in some fields nearly all articles involved author
   payment [4]. Only four percent of articles involved submission fees
   (as under the OA model). The most common requirement was page charges,
   which took into account the range of size of manuscripts submitted
   (38% of all articles published) and further revision fees (3% of
   articles). Some publishers asked authors to pay for copies of reprints
   or preprints that could be distributed by them (20% of articles).
   Altogether, the average cost when an author payment was made was about
   $750 in current dollars. Most of the payment in the U.S. was covered
   by the Federal government by grant to the authors' organizations or as
   the authors' employer (56% of payment), 26 percent of payment was by
   other funders, and 18 percent by authors themselves (i.e.,
   out-of-pocket).

   <p>The policy of author payment from Federal grant or contract was not
   without some dispute, although an attempt was made to set an author
   payment policy. A Federal Council for Science & Technology (FCST)
   policy stated that Federal payment of page charges is recommended
   under the following conditions: (1) research papers report work
   supported by the government, (2) charges are levied impartially on all
   research papers published by the journal, (3) payment of such charges
   is in no sense a condition for acceptance of manuscripts by the
   journal, and (4) the journals involved are not operated for profit. In
   hindsight, the latter condition may have contributed to the decline of
   author payment. In order to avoid payment, an increasing number of
   authors began submitting their manuscripts to commercial and other
   non-payment journals. While page charges were not the most important
   reason given in studies at that time for choosing a journal, page
   charges were a factor nevertheless. The competition for manuscripts
   resulted in many society and other non-profit journals losing revenue
   from declining page charges and thereby having to increase their
   subscription prices to libraries. I don't see how these conditions are
   changed by the re-emergence of author payment.

   <p>If author payment is to be examined realistically, valid metrics must
   be used to assess its merits. While observation and comparison of
   price trends and impact measures among types of publishers are useful,
   there are several other important indicators that one should keep in
   mind. The rekindling of author payment has highlighted the importance
   of three other indicators: the publishers' cost of processing
   articles, circulation, and the processing cost per subscription. The
   article processing cost has always been an important indicator, but
   largely ignored in the literature because publishers have generally
   been unwilling to reveal their costs. In this commentary, by author
   processing costs I include not only direct costs but also allocation
   of support costs such as overhead, system infrastructure, financing,
   and so on that must also be recovered through author payment revenue
   in order to break even. These costs, of course, together with overhead
   and profit are partially used to determine subscription prices and
   license fees, but article processing costs are not the same as prices.
   There are two publishing services that authors and readers (or their
   libraries) buy: (1) the value added to article information content and
   (2) means of distribution or access to the information. Comparison of
   publishers or journals should be made on the basis of article
   processing costs and the article attributes provided and not solely on
   subscription price or size derivations of it.

   <p>Circulation is the dominant variable that determines price up to a
   critical mass of about 5,000 library subscribers and the circulation
   of most science journals is below that amount. The price necessary for
   journals to break even can range from $100 to well over $1,000 per
   subscription depending on their journal circulation and size [5]. For
   example, ignoring non-article processing costs (e.g., tables of
   contents, letters, etc.) and assuming a typical size journal of 150
   articles per year, an article processing cost of $3,000 per article
   (not atypical for traditional science publishers), a $40 per
   subscription cost of reproduction and mailing, and circulation of 500,
   1,000 and 5,000 the subscription price must be at least $940, $490 and
   $130 respectively merely to break even (subtract $40 from each if
   distributed electronically). The article processing cost and number of
   articles processed also affects price because the total amount of
   article processing and marginal cost of reproduction and mailing would
   increase if the number of articles went up. For example, if the number
   of articles published is 200, the respective prices to break even
   would be about $1,250, $650 and $170 (actually slightly less due to
   fixed costs associated with various sub-processes). While some
   citation impact indicators take size into account, circulation is
   rarely considered because reliable circulation data are not widely
   reported, particularly by commercial publishers.

   <p>Clearly, increased contribution from authors would reduce the high
   prices of many journals due to their low circulation and/or large
   size. The question, then, for author payment advocates is what
   realistic article processing costs are for journals providing
   different levels of attributes (i.e., quality, speed of publishing,
   special features) and what authors (or their funders) are willing to
   pay for this service and it's attributes. Open access publishers are
   currently charging between $500 to about $1,750 per article.
   Traditional publishers indicate the cost is from $2,000 to $4,000 with
   all costs included (i.e., no hidden subsidies). I believe that it may
   typically be in the $3,000 to $4,000 range depending on rejection
   rates, refereeing, editing, special graphics, formatting, special
   features and so on. Nevertheless, if author payment does become widely
   accepted, publishers will have to compete on a basis of what authors
   are willing to pay for such journal attributes as reputation,
   circulation (number and composition of readers), value-added features
   and speed of publishing.

   <p>Can commercial publishers compete in an author payment environment? I
   don't think they want to, but evidence suggests that they could. To
   begin with, their article processing costs appear to be competitive,
   although on the high side of my range quoted above ($3,000 to $4,000).
   Even though their costs appear to be competitive, two reasons for
   their high prices in the past were (a) that their average circulation
   was lower and (b) their size (number of articles) tended to be larger
   than other publishers' journals. Thus, the high prices are not just
   due to profit. The attributes of their journals also are competitive.
   Therefore, there is no reason for commercial publishers not to be
   included in an author payment journal system. On the contrary, there
   are reasons they should not be excluded, but rather encouraged to
   participate. The investment necessary to replace an existing
   commercial journal tends to be about $100,000 for start-up, capital
   requirements, future research and development, and operations. Thus,
   total investment to replace all commercial journals would be on the
   order of hundreds of millions of dollars, with many replacement
   start-up journals not surviving due to their experimental nature and
   the inexperience of those publishing them. I think it a mistake to
   dismiss commercial publishers. If they cannot compete in this
   environment, so be it. I suspect they will find a way to thrive, which
   should be much to the benefit of the open access concept.

   <p>The question then is: "Who should pay for article processing?" It
   doesn't make sense for authors themselves to pay, even though some
   authors have paid out of their own pockets in the past and, as
   readers, some currently help support journals through personal
   subscriptions. Authors from developing countries have objected to
   author payment because their research is not funded. Yet library
   subscriptions and licenses have been subsidized by some publishers and
   some journals in publishers' portfolios and articles within journals
   have always been subsidized by others. Thus, there is no reason some
   author payment will not be subsidized by other authors.

   <p>Some have suggested that universities should pay since they already
   expend so much in purchases of library collections and examples are
   given which compare potential author payment with library collection
   purchases, but with conflicting results. Even though some universities
   may pay more in collection purchases than they would in author
   payment, the approach ignores the fact that, while most articles are
   authored by university scientists, most reading is done by scientists
   located elsewhere and, as such, their libraries currently contribute
   to publisher revenue. Thus, universities would, in effect, partially
   subsidize other organization journal purchase and use by their staff.

   <p>It seems to me that research funders have a responsibility to
   subsidize article processing. A distinction is made here between the
   source of R&D funds and performers who conduct R&D from these funds.
   Of $265 billion in R&D funds in the U.S. (2000), only $30 billion is
   performed in universities and colleges even though about three-fourths
   of articles are authored (or co-authored) by their scientists. Over
   half of the university $30 billion is funded by the Federal
   government, about one-fourth of these funds are internally funded, and
   the rest from industry, foundations, etc. About another $10 billion is
   performed by other organizations which lead to articles.

   <p>There is a long history of the U.S. Federal government recognizing the
   importance of open access to research and technology results through
   the technical report literature. Most agencies made copies of these
   reports openly available without cost to organizations funded by them,
   and provided access to all others through the National Technical
   Information Service at a cost to the recipient of reproduction and
   mailing. This policy recognizes that the value of research results is
   highly dependent on the extent to which the information is used.
   Surveys of scientists in non-university environments over the past 25
   years have clearly demonstrated the enormous and growing use,
   usefulness and value of science articles. In effect, results of about
   $40 billion in R&D funding for research performed in universities (and
   elsewhere) have produced an essential resource used in $225 billion of
   R&D effort performed elsewhere.

   <p>Some have argued in the past that university authors write largely to
   achieve tenure and advancement, as though this is inherently bad.
   While this is a motivation for some, I think advancement of science is
   a more powerful motivation. Furthermore, the discipline of writing
   about research in many instances is an integral part of the creative
   research process. Regardless, the body of journal literature, even
   with some poor articles, has more than proven itself by its use among
   authors and the many more scientists who do not write articles.

   <p>If open access by author payment is in fact an optimum model, there
   must be some way to demonstrate it other than by the trickle approach
   now taking place. To be realistic, all system participants must be
   involved in a comprehensive manner. One way that I think this can be
   done is initially through experimentation, or other approaches
   requiring primary funding agencies, publishers, libraries, and other
   participants to cooperate in a meaningful way. This may seem
   unrealistic, but just as with the genome experience, I think that all
   current participants have the goals of science as their ultimate
   mission. It will take an influential force to make it happen.
