<h>Florida Equine ID Cards for Intrastate and Interstate Movement

   <p>The Division of Animal Industry of the Department of Agriculture and
   Consumer Services is now offering laminated cards, containing digital
   pictures of the horse, as a voluntary alternative to the current paper
   EIA test document (VS Form 10-11) and the Equine Event Extension.
   There are two types of cards available:
    <p>1. The Negative EIA Test Verification Card will be accepted as proof
       of a negative EIA test within the state of Florida. The card has
       the same expiration date as the VS form 10-11 (coggins form). This
       card is not valid for change of ownership, only the original VS
       form 10-11 or certified lab copy of the VS form 10-11 (coggins
       form) can be used for this purpose.
    <p>2. The Equine Interstate Passport Card will be accepted by
       participating states as proof of a negative EIA test and an
       Official Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (OCVI) within the
       previous six months, for interstate movement to equine events.
       This card is intended for the owner who frequents equine events in
       participating states. When traveling the OCVI and EIA do not need
       to accompany the Passport Card as it contains the OCVI, EIA, owner
       and veterinarian information. This card is not valid for change of
       ownership, only the original VS form 10-11 or certified lab copy
       of the VS form 10-11 can be used for this purpose.

   <p>The Equine Event Extension is a paper document which has been used in
   the past, and will still be offered by the State of Florida. The Event
   Extension, like the Passport Card, acts as an extension of the OCVI
   from 30 days to 6 months. For interstate travel, using the Equine
   Event Extension, the OCVI, current EIA and Event Extension document
   must be carried.

   <p>The states currently honoring the Florida Equine Passport Card and the
   Equine Event Extensions are: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana,
   Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee,
   Virginia and West Virginia.

   <p>The Division of Animal Industry is now charging a fee of $10 for the
   first horse on the Equine Event Extension application and $5 for each
   additional animal included on the same application. The Negative EIA
   Test Verification Card will be $5 per card and the Equine Interstate
   Passport Card will carry a fee of $15 for the first horse on the
   application and $5 for each additional animal listed on the same
   application.

   <p>Requests for applications or questions about the Equine Cards can be
   made through our Bartow office by contacting Dr. John Irby, Bob
   Crawford Building, 605 E. Main St., Bartow, Florida 33830-4831,

   Calhoun Street, Room 331 Mayo Building, Tallahassee, Florida
   32399-0800, (850)410-0900 or by e-mailing to ecards@doacs.state.fl.us.
   Applications can be requested and digital images taken by individuals
   or veterinarians. The digital pictures required for the equine cards
   are the entire left side, entire right side and front view of the
   entire head. Each view should have approximately 10% background
   bordering all 4 sides of the image. The pictures for the equine cards
   can be submitted on a CD to our Bartow office with a completed
   application.

  <p> The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services is now
   participating in the USDA sponsored National Animal Identification
   System (NAIS). Anyone requesting a Florida Equine Card will be
   required to register the location where their horse resides. For more
   information on the National Animal Identification System you may log
   on to www.usda.gov/nais. If you have questions regarding the NAIS
   please email the Department at animalid@doacs.state.fl.us.
