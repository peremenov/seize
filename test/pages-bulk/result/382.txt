 <h>Secretary Rumsfeld Media Availability with Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sabah
                             Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah



   <p>RUMSFELD: Good afternoon. I have had the privilege and pleasure of
   hosting the foreign minister of Kuwait for a meeting and a luncheon,
   and had the opportunity to express the appreciation of our country and
   the American people for the steadfast support that Kuwait has offered
   in this coalition effort, both with respect to the global war on
   terrorism and certainly with respect to Operation Iraqi Freedom.

   <p>I should also add that we expressed our appreciation to the minister,
   His Excellency, for the significant humanitarian assistance which
   Kuwait is offering. They have, with the United Kingdom, built a
   pipeline into Iraq that's now delivering some 2 million liters of
   fresh water per day. Their Kuwaiti relief organizations have sent
   dozens of trucks with food and medicine and water to a number of Iraqi
   cities. Kuwait has set up a humanitarian operations center to serve as
   a focal point for funneling aid into Iraq, and it's providing some
   45,000 meals a day; in addition, has pledged a significant
   humanitarian relief fund for assistance in Iraq.

   <p>We also talked about the -- our shared interest in finding the
   remaining people that are missing or who are prisoners of war, both
   from this conflict and also from the conflict in 1991. It is something
   that the government of Kuwait and the government of the United States
   share as a deep concern and an abiding interest. And I can -- I
   assured the minister that the United States is doing everything
   possible to pursue every conceivable lead. And we are hopeful that
   people in Iraq who oppose that regime will come forward and provide
   any information that they may have so that we can, in fact, achieve
   our goal of returning all of those individuals.

   <p>Excellency?

   <p>AL-SABAH: Thank you.

   <p>I had a very fruitful discussion with the secretary on matters of
   profound importance to Kuwait. The issue of the POWs is utmost
   importance to us. As we enter this phase of the Iraqi Freedom
   operations, and that is the stabilization phase, the issue of the POWs
   becomes paramount. The secretary assured me that they are doing their
   best to search for our POWs and the Americans who have been missing in
   this conflict and also in Desert Storm.

   <p>Also, we had discussed the ways of expediting and increasing the
   humanitarian assistance to Iraq and ways to speed up the stabilization
   process for Iraq.

   <p>I thank this administration for what they have done and their
   steadfast support to Kuwait's causes and also in their effort and
   their deed, actually, to liberate and to deliver the Iraqis from their
   bondage.

   <p>Thank you.

   <p>RUMSFELD: We'd be happy to take a few questions.

   <p>Q: Mr. Secretary, a spokesman at the Syrian Foreign Ministry today
   denied, flatly denied, U.S. charges that Syria either has chemical
   weapons or is giving support to or harboring former Iraqi leaders. How
   do you respond to that, sir?

   <p>RUMSFELD: Well, first I would say that we have seen the chemical
   weapons tests in Syria over the past 12, 15 months. And second, that
   we have intelligence that shows that Syria has allowed Syrians and
   others to come across the border into Iraq, people armed and people
   carrying leaflets indicating that they'll be rewarded if they kill
   Americans and members of the coalition. And we have intelligence that
   indicates that some Iraqi people have been allowed into Syria, in some
   cases to stay, in some cases to transit.

   <p>Q: Mr. Secretary, do you think Kuwait has more to offer for the
   coalition in this stage?

   <p>RUMSFELD: Well, there's no question but that Kuwait has been a strong
   supporter and wonderfully cooperative and helpful, and we appreciate
   that a great deal. There's no question but that the neighboring
   countries have been helpful in the humanitarian aspects of this, and
   we appreciate that, we value it. I know the Iraqi people appreciate
   that.

   <p>And the stabilization period, it's not possible to know how long it
   will be, but certainly an enormous effort is going in to getting
   electricity back on, and getting water working, and seeing that there
   is the proper distribution of medical supplies. And we appreciate all
   the help that the GCC countries have provided.

   <p>Q: Mr. Secretary, can you help us understand, is it correct that Ahmed
   Chalabi and his fighters are now going to Baghdad with the backing and
   support of the Pentagon or the Central Command? Can you help us
   understand what they will do there and how we should appropriately
   understand this issue, other than U.S. backing, Pentagon backing, for
   his group in particular?

   <p>RUMSFELD: I can't answer your specific question, I'm sorry. All I can
   say is that the United States government, and that includes the
   Pentagon, is not backing anybody for any role in Iraq. The Iraqi
   people are, over time, going to have to make those judgments, and I'm
   sure they will.

   <p>Q: May I have a question for the Excellency? What are your thoughts,
   Excellency, about the potential for a civil war in Iraq or for the
   potential for more disorder? What is your concern?

   <p>AL-SABAH: Well, this is a country that has been kidnapped for the past
   35 years. The Iraqi regime, Saddam's regime has basically destroyed,
   ruptured the very fabric of the Iraqi society. Decent people have been
   tortured, killed and exiled. It would take a long time, I think, some
   time for the healing process to take a hold in Iraq.

   <p>Now, saying that, I have full confidence that the Iraqis are --
   actually at this moment are rejoicing; it's a state of jubilation that
   they have been rid from this tyrannical regime. It's up to them now to
   settle down and to form their own government. And I'm confident that
   the -- from what we hear from them, all of them, that the welfare of
   the Iraqis and the establishment of a representative government [are]
   at the top of their interests now.

   <p>Q: Mr. Secretary, should Syria understand that one of the potential
   consequences of their actions that you're talking about today is
   military action by the United States?

   <p>RUMSFELD: I didn't say anything like that.

   <p>Q: Yeah, but could you respond to that, though? Is that something that
   they should consider as a potential --

   <p>RUMSFELD: I think what -- what I've -- I've said what I've said. And
   I've stated facts, and that's what I tend to do. In terms of policy,
   that's for others.

   <p>Q: Mr. Secretary, are you seeing anymore combat operations,
   significant combat operations, inside Iraq? Can you characterize the
   situation on the ground in Iraq now?

   <p>RUMSFELD: It -- the situation in Iraq today is improved over yesterday
   and it's improved each day. And I suspect it will continue to improve.
   The reality is that the coalition forces are now in a good portion of
   the country, but not all of the country; they're in a good portion of
   Baghdad, but not all of Baghdad. They are continuing to find that
   there are two things: Periodic pockets of resistance; firefights still
   exist in Baghdad and elsewhere. The other thing that is of concern is
   the type of thing where you end up with a suicide car or bomb of some
   type that is not so much a(n) act of war as it is an act of terrorism.

   <p>But I'm very encouraged that food and water and medicines are being
   moved throughout the country. We are encouraged to find a great many
   people in Iraq are assisting the -- our forces, coalition forces, in
   finding ways to provide a secure environment so people can go about
   their lives.

   <p>Thank you very much.
