<h>Lady in Red




<h>Excerpt:

   <p>Jackson Trent leaned back in his chair, folded his arms behind his
   head and propped his feet on the credenza behind his desk. For the
   first time in a long time he was looking forward to doing nothing.

   <p>He'd joined the NYPD as soon as he'd finished putting himself through
   college, going from patrol to narcotics in just two years. Most cops
   didn't last long as narcs and he hadn't been the exception. After
   three years he'd called it quits, leaving not only to the division but
   to the force, as well.

   <p>He'd worked his ass off for the last four years, building his P.I.
   business into something worthwhile. He'd started this agency by buying
   the skip tracing business of another. He'd given up most of that, too,
   as many folks who skipped town rather than deal with the law usually
   did so for a reason, and weren't usually too amenable to being brought
   back. He'd eventually sold that aspect of the company for more than
   he'd paid for it. Now he concentrated on what he did best, finding
   missing people, lost children, deadbeat dads who wouldn't pay their
   child support. For the first time his agency netted him a six figure
   income and he had six other investigators working under him.

   <p>Life was sweet, except for one thing. The one man he'd spent half his
   life trying to find still eluded him. Or he had until two days ago.
   Surprise of surprises, Duke Anderson called him, wanting to arrange a
   meeting. For almost twenty years the man had seemed to fall of the
   earth. While Jackson wondered what had caused the man to resurface, he
   refused to question his good fortune.

   <p>Maybe finally he could make sense of a long ago murder that cost his
   father his job, his reputation and almost cost him his freedom. Maybe
   finally he could find out who was responsible for Sharon Glenn's
   death, though if he found out, he'd be the only one looking.

   <p>But for today, he planned on getting out of the office, smelling some
   rosebuds while they were still in bloom. Maybe he'd go to Central Park
   and watch some people go by who he didn't have under surveillance.
   Something, anything that didn't involve clients or zoom lenses or
   computer databases of missing children.

   <p>He dropped his feet to the floor, just as his intercom sounded. His
   secretary's voice blared at him. "Jack, there's someone here to see
   you."

   <p>"Damn!" He'd been minutes away from a clean getaway, ruined by his own
   procrastination. "Who is it?"

   <p>"She says her name is Charlotte Hicks."

   <p>The name didn't ring a bell, but there was no reason why it should.
   "Have Danny take it. I'm on my way out."

   <p>"She says she'll only talk to y-" Peggy's voice died out on the phone,
   but he could hear her say plainly. "You can't go in there."

   <p>A second later, a woman-tall, voluptuous and dressed completely in
   red-burst through his office door. She clutched some little rat dog so
   tightly to her ample bosom that he wondered if the poor thing could
   breathe. "I'm so sorry to intrude," the woman began. "But I really
   must speak to you."

   <p>He looked past the woman to where Peggy stood, hands on hips glaring
   furiously at the woman. Peggy was no match for this freight train of a
   woman. He waved Peggy off, and gestured toward one of the visitors
   chairs. "What can I do for you Ms Hicks?"

   <p>With a sigh, she complied, adjusting the little dog on her lap, giving
   him a chance to return to his own seat.

   <p>She leaned toward him, nearly smushing the little dog again. "I'm in
   trouble, Mr. Trent. I don't know where else to turn. A friend of mine
   recommended your services." She rattled off a name unfamiliar to him,
   which wasn't necessarily odd. He didn't know every client that had
   walked through the door in the past six years. "Go on."

   <p>She sighed so dramatically that he wondered if Peggy or one of the
   guys hadn't arranged this meeting as some form of practical joke. "I'm
   being blackmailed, Mr. Trent. And I'm not even sure by whom."

   <p>She sat back as if she were relieved to have told him that. She
   crossed her legs, long, shapely legs that at her age must come from
   either great genes or a first-class personal trainer. Although her
   face was unlined, he suspected a surgeon's scalpel had more to do with
   that than a lack of gravity. Still, she was one of the most beautiful
   women he'd ever met.

   <p>And she was trouble. He'd been in enough trouble to know it when he
   saw it. Exactly what kind of trouble, he wasn't sure, but today he
   wasn't in the mood for any of them.

   <p>"Why do you think someone is blackmailing you?"

   <p>"The notes." Se reached into the minuscule purse she carried and
   pulled out a wad of folded paper. She extended them toward him by
   holding one corner between her thumb and index finger.

   <p>He took the papers and unfolded them-three notes printed in black ink
   on standard copy paper. The first note read simply, "I know what you
   did." The second read, "You're a liar and a cheat. I'm going to make
   you pay. The third said, "If you don't come clean, I'll take away
   every Scarlet thing you own." Given her attire, the last sounded like
   a warning from the fashion police.

   <p>She looked at him expectantly with liquid brown eyes. "Can you tell
   anything from the notes?"

   <p>Sure, her mystery blackmailer preferred a Helvetica font. "What
   happened to the envelopes?"

   <p>"What envelopes."

   <p>"I'm assuming they came in envelopes, perhaps mailed to you?"

   <p>"Yes, oh, yes." She brushed at a lock of black hair that barely
   reached her shoulder. "I threw the envelopes away. Are they
   important?"

   <p>Only if she planned to figure out who sent them. Jackson ground his
   teeth together. Where did this woman live, under a rock? Probably a
   red one. Even if the last cop show she'd watched on TV was Starsky and
   Hutch she should have known better. "The post mark might have given us
   some clue as to where they were sent from. Then there's always the
   possibility of finding a usable print."

   <p>"Oh, then I probably shouldn't have thrown them out, should I?"

   <p>He inhaled and the scent of her perfume reached him, the cloying smell
   of roses. "Can you tell me anything else Mrs. Hicks? Who do you think
   is behind this?"

   <p>"I assure you, I really wouldn't know."

   <p>"The letter claims you're a liar and a thief. You can't think of
   anyone who would want to accuse you of those things?"

   <p>"Mr. Trent, I own a cosmetics company. I suspect one of my competitors
   is trying to ruin me by claiming I stole the formula for one of their
   products." She lunged forward in her seat so suddenly that even the
   dog looked around searching for danger. "My life is in jeopardy, Mr.
   Trent. I know it is."

   <p>"Why do you say that? Has anyone been following you?"

   <p>"No."

   <p>"Have you been receiving threatening phone calls?"

   <p>"Only from my daughter."

   <p>He could imagine why. "Has anyone tried to harm you physically?"

   <p>She shook her head. "No, no, no. I can't explain it to you the way I
   mean. I'm not crazy, Mr. Trent. I know what I know."

  <p>"Have you told any of this to the police?"

  <p>"Of course not. I was counting on you to help me."

   <p>And he knew that he had no intention of getting involved in this
   woman's melodrama. He was about to do something he hadn't done in a
   long while. He was going to turn down a client.

   <p>"I'm sorry, Ms. Hicks, but I'm not sure what I can do for you. I'm
   about to go on vacation." It wasn't a total lie. One day off counted
   as a vacation, didn't it. He stood and walked around his desk.
   Thankfully, she made his job easier by rising too. He took her by the
   elbow and started toward the door. "If you feel your life is in
   danger, maybe you ought to go to the police. They have more manpower
   and better resources to handle a case like this." And better access to
   the mental ward at Bellevue Hospital.

   <p>"I couldn't possibly."

   <p>He didn't bother to ask why not. He was afraid she might tell him.
   "I'm sorry, Ms. Hicks." He'd managed to get her over the threshold of
   his office. He stepped back inside and quickly shut the door.

   <p>Only one thing marred his glee at having gotten rid of her so
   easily-the stark look of fear that had suffused her face when he
   closed the door on her. She might genuinely be in some kind of
   trouble, but it wasn't his job to deal with every nut case in New
   York.

   <p>He retook his seat, no longer feeling much like doing nothing. While
   he was here, he might as well get some work done.

   <p>Peggy poked her head in his office before his computer booted
   properly. "Hey, Jack."

   <p>Her prompt entry after the woman's departure refueled an earlier
   suspicion. "Okay, which one of you people put that poor woman up to
   coming here?"

   <p>"Don't you know who that was?"

   <p>Jackson shrugged. "The lady in red?"

   <p>"Duh. More like the Scarlet Woman. You know, Scarlet Woman Cosmetics."

   <p>"I've heard of them." His friend Adam's wife Samantha modeled for
   them. In fact, she had sent him some samples a while back that were
   still burning a hole in the bottom drawer of his desk. He rooted
   around until he found them and tossed them on top of his desk. "Does
   mascara go bad?"

   <p>"Only after you open it." Peggy picked up a jar of bath salts and
   examined it. "Why have you been hoarding these things in here?"

   <p>He shrugged. Lacking a girlfriend or wife to give them to, he'd left
   them where he'd put them. "Do you want them?"

   <p>"Do mink wear fur?" She gathered up the items piling them on one arm
   with the other hand. "Who should I write the thank you note to? Ms.
   Thompson?"

   <p>"Who?"

   <p>Peggy shook her head in a way that she knew he was thinking, "Men!"
   "Ms. Thompson, the woman you just showed the door to."

   <p>"You told me her name was Charlotte Hicks."

   <p>"That's her stage name. Her maiden name, I guess. Her married name is
   Charlotte Thompson."

   <p>Luckily, Peggy had already turned to leave, so she didn't notice how
   the mention of that name and its implications momentarily poleaxed
   him. It didn't just rain, it poured, and he was s.o.l. for an
   umbrella. Was it coincidence that she had come to him, or had she
   sought him out on purpose? And if she had, why hadn't she made it
   plain who she was?

   <p>Oh damn. He was going to have to help her after all.

                                    <h>Two

   <p>Carly Thompson looked around the crowded conference room with
   dissatisfaction. The meeting to finalize plans for the upcoming press
   junket to Martha's Vineyard to celebrate the tenth anniversary of
   Scarlet Woman cosmetics had gone well. In those few short years,
   Scarlet Woman had gone from a tiny mom and pop operation to a
   multimillion dollar corporation. Yet as everyone packed up preparing
   to get back to their own desks and their own work, it reminded Carly
   that one chair had remained unfilled during the entire meeting-the one
   belonging to her mother.

   <p>Usually Charlotte opted for the late and dramatic entrance with the
   emphasis on dramatic, but rarely did she skip meetings altogether.
   She'd wanted her mother here so that she couldn't later claim that no
   one had given her the details of the trip or that she didn't know what
   was expected of her. As the "front woman" for the company it was
   imperative that she knew exactly what to say when the press came
   calling. Carly preferred to run things from behind the scenes, out of
   the limelight.

   <p>Realizing she'd been drumming her fingers on the surface of the glass
   conference table, Carly folded her hands in her lap. Where the hell
   could her mother be? Unlike some people, Carly actually did more for
   the company than shmooze celebrities and take interviews. Carly didn't
   have time to sit around contemplating her fingernails.

   <p>Just as she stood to return to her own office, the double doors to the
   conference room burst open. Johnny, her mother's chauffeur stood to
   one side, allowing Charlotte to breeze into the room. The scent of
   roses reached Carly clear at the other end of the long table. As
   usual, Charlotte dressed head to toe in red, this time a Valentino
   with high-heeled stiletto pumps. She clutched Mr. Jingles, her bison
   frize tightly against her boson as she paused at the foot of the
   conference table.

   <p>"Darling, I'm so sorry to be late." She fanned herself with her free
   hand. "Bruce and I are off our schedule."

   <p>Before Carly could ask who the devil Bruce was, a man strode into the
   room. He was tall, maybe a foot over her own height of five foot four,
   dark, and definitely handsome with high cheekbones, a square jaw and
   deep brown eyes.

   <p>Charlotte continued, "Meet my new personal assistant."

   <p>Personal assistant, her eye. Every one of her mother's personal
   assistants, and there had been many, were in reality the men who
   shared her bed. For once she couldn't fault her mother's taste, even
   if the selection surprised her. Usually, her mother stuck with the
   sort of fey and sycophantic man that danced at her beck and call. This
   man was so far from being a "Bruce" that whoever named him ought to be
   hauled in for child abuse.

   <p>Focusing her gaze on her mother, Carly gritted her teeth. Charlotte
   beamed at her as if she'd just executed the coup of the century. Why
   her mother felt she had to buy the affection of men with some made-up
   position she didn't know. Nor could she understand why Charlotte
   thought Carly would put this man on her payroll. After the last one,
   six months ago, Carly had balked and told her mother that she could
   pay her men out of her own pocket. There hadn't been any "personal
   assistants" since then. Her mother must really want this man to open
   that can of worms again.

   <p>Carly's gaze slid to "Bruce." She wondered how quickly he'd make it
   out the door when he discovered she had no intention of paying him one
   red cent. His gaze met hers, strong and steady. She'd admit there was
   something commanding about him, something magnetic. She could
   understand her mother's attraction to him, but she couldn't let her
   mother's desire rule what was in Carly's mind best for the company.
   She raised her own eyebrows and crossed her arms in silent challenge
   "Bruce, is it? Well, Bruce, would you mind waiting outside while I
   speak with my mother?" She'd formed it as a question, but she meant
   for him to leave.

   <p>Charlotte patted his arm in a possessive way. "Yes, dear. Why don't
   you wait for me in my office. You know which one that is."

   <p>Thankfully he nodded and left without any fuss. As he did so,
   Charlotte slid into a seat with a dramatic sigh. "What did you want to
   talk about, dear?"

   <p>Carly folded her arms. "How about you missing the meeting, for
   starters."

   <p>Charlotte adjusted the red bow around Mr. Jingles neck. "Oh that. I'm
   sure you can fill me in."

  <p>"That's just the point. I don't want to have to fill you in. I wanted
   you to hear it all first hand, perhaps offer a little input."

   <p>"Oh, please, you treat every suggestion from me as if it were the
   bastard child in the attic-to be hidden and avoided at all costs. You
   didn't need me here."

   <p>Carly pursed her lips, realized what she was doing and stopped. "That
   is not true. I have followed through on many of your ideas."

   <p>"Only after someone else made you see the wisdom of them." Charlotte
   crossed her legs and sat back as if she hadn't a care in the world.
   "Go on."

   <p>Annoyed by her mother's nonchalance, Carly gritted her teeth.
   Charlotte knew she hated it when she took a cavalier attitude toward
   the business and was deliberately baiting her. But why? Did it really
   matter? Carly could give as good as she got.

   <p>Canting her hip to one side, she said, "I don't care how good that man
   is in bed, I am not putting him on the payroll of this company."

   <p>"You don't have to, dear. I already did. I spoke to Carrie in human
   resources this morning."

   <p>Blast! Leave it to her mother to put the staff in the middle of this.
   Carrie wouldn't have questioned her mother's request or brought it to
   Carly's attention before completing the paperwork. Charlotte had hired
   employees for legitimate purposes before, and the true purpose of her
   former personal assistants had been kept between mother and daughter.

   <p>"So you went behind my back."

   <p>"I did nothing of the kind. I do need a personal assistant for this
   trip. Johnny refuses to come. He hates the ocean. Besides, he's on
   vacation next week. I'll need a driver at least. Who knows, with all
   the press, I might need a body guard as well."

   <p>Carly gave her mother a droll look. "Are you trying to tell me you are
   not sleeping with that man?"

   <p>Charlotte petted Mr. Jingles head. "I didn't say that. But he does
   perform legitimate services. I didn't think you'd mind."

   <p>Right. More likely Charlotte had expected to talk her into letting him
   stay, which in fact she'd done, more because Carly lacked the will to
   fight with her mother with the trip coming up than anything else.
   Carly sank back into her seat. "What exactly do you plan to do with
   this man while he's here."

   <p>"You don't really want me to answer that question do you?"

   <p>Carly cast her mother a narrow-eyed glare. "I didn't mean sexually,
   mother, which you know. I meant what are his duties? Do you need
   somewhere for him to work?" Like she'd actually make him work in the
   first place.

   <p>"Oh, that. I gave him my old office."

   <p>For months she'd been trying to persuade her mother to move her things
   from that office considering she rarely set foot in the building. That
   office provided great views of Manhattan in both southern and easterly
   directions, views Carly coveted. "That office is bigger than mine."

   <p>Charlotte shrugged. "The man has to sit somewhere."

   <p>Carly resisted the urge to tell her mother exactly where and on what
   the man could rest his behind. But "Bruce" wasn't really the problem;
   Charlotte was. "Absolutely not. That man is not using that office."

   <p>To Carly's surprise, her mother stood, letting Mr. Jingles scamper
   onto the floor and a look of steel came into her eyes. "Yes, he is."

   <p>"No he's not," she said, equally determined. "I am president and Chief
   Executive Officer of this company. I make the decisions here. How
   would it look to have some glorified errand boy occupying the largest
   office in the company?"

   <p>"And maybe you are forgetting who owns this company. Fifty-one percent
   of it is mine. I have allowed you to run it however you saw fit for
   the last eight years, but it is still my company. And he will be
   staying in my office."

   <p>Carly bit her lip, a habit left over from childhood. Maybe she had
   been running this company so long that she forgot who held the purse
   strings, but her mother had never pulled rank on her before. That she
   did so now over some man smarted. It more than smarted. Carly had
   always wondered where her mother's greater allegiance layette her men
   or to her daughter. She supposed she had her answer.

   <p>Momentarily nonplused by her mother's betrayal, she stood. "Fine,
   mother. Do whatever you want. You always have. Just keep him out of my
   way." She stalked out of the conference room as Mr. Jingles scampered
   to get out of the way. She went to her own office and slammed the
   door. She flung herself into the leather swivel chair behind her desk,
   but stopped, seeing her father's picture on her desk.

   <p>She touched her fingers to the glass covering the image of his face.
   Although she had only been seven years old when he'd suffered a heart
   attack while driving, she remembered him as a kind, gentle man. He had
   been twenty years older than her mother and, in some people's minds,
   the wrong race, but the three of them had been happy.

   <p>Carly swallowed in a throat suddenly clogged with emotion. The last
   words he'd spoken to her had been "take care of your mother." Then
   he'd slipped off into nothing or whatever awaited after the grave.
   After he was gone, her mother closed in on herself in a way that Carly
   hadn't thought she would ever come out of it. In a way, she'd lost
   both parents that day, because even when her mother did snap out of
   it, she'd never come back to being herself. She'd always been a little
   flaky, but never the woman she was now-spoiled, demanding, vain. At
   eight years old, Carly had morphed into the adult in the family and
   Charlotte had regressed to be the child. Even this company had been
   Carly's idea, a means of supporting themselves while capitalizing on
   her mother's former fame as an actress. It had even resulted in a few
   cameo parts for her mother, which had served to promote the company as
   well.

   <p>She had always tried to keep her promise to her father, but sometimes
   it was hard, it was damn hard. "I miss you, daddy," she whispered,
   wiped the dampness from her cheeks and got to work.



   <p>Jackson Trent stared out the window at the view of Midtown Manhattan,
   but he paid little attention to the scenery. Instead he wished his
   father Donovan had never laid eyes on Alexander Thompson. The two men
   met when the elder Trent had been accused of murder in a case that
   made headlines and Thompson had agreed to defend him for free.
   Thompson had gotten the case dismissed when it was revealed that the
   only witness, and therefore the only evidence against his father, was
   a drunk who recanted his testimony under Thomas's examination.

   <p>Donovan had considered Thompson a miracle worker. Jackson remembered
   that long-ago day when his father had looked him in the eye and said,
   "If you ever find a way to repay that man, you do it." Jackson
   promised he would, but the next day Alex Thompson was dead. Everyone
   had speculated that the stress of the trial had contributed to the
   heart attack that took his life.

   <p>Jackson assumed the debt had been voided at that moment. But when his
   widow Charlotte came to him, asking for his help, he figured the debt
   had simply been transferred.

   <p>But Charlotte Thompson was nothing like his fourteen-year-old
   recollection of her. Nor was she the screen persona he'd come to know
   from the few films she'd made. The Charlotte that had come to see him
   was more of a caricature of her screen self, a cross between Diahnne
   Carroll and Eva Gabor.

   <p>And the story she'd told him. Too bizarre to be believed. In the ten
   years he'd been a P.I., he'd heard some whoppers, but hers took the
   cake. He figured there had to be some truth in it, but which part and
   how much was anybody's guess.

   <p>Oddly, there was something maternal about her, as well. Or maybe that
   was merely that boy still in him, the one who had lost his mother
   before he was old enough to retain her memory, seeking what wasn't
   there.

   <p>And the girl. He'd met her once while her father was defending his: a
   tiny thing with dark, inquisitive eyes and a cloud of orange hair.
   He'd called her carrot-top and she'd kicked him in the leg for his
   troubles. Then she'd dragged him up to her tree house and showed him
   all the treasures she secreted up there.

   <p>He held that memory fondly, though he saw nothing of that little girl
   in the woman he'd seen today. He hadn't intended to start that mini
   staring contest in the conference room, but her appearance had
   surprised him. He hadn't expected to find the same little girl, nor
   had he expected the severe woman who'd stood before him with a pinched
   expression on her face, her hair, dark not the flaming red he
   remembered, pulled back into some awful bun, dressed in a shapeless
   suit that was as revealing as a burlap sack. He smiled to himself. At
   least she was still short.

   <p>Yet, he didn't understand her mother's need for subterfuge. If
   Charlotte were receiving threatening notes as she claimed, wouldn't
   she want her daughter to know about it, to be on her guard if nothing
   else? Why she insisted on insinuating him into the company in such a
   manner, he had no idea, and it didn't sit well with him.

   <p>No, he'd probably be better off if Donovan Trent had never heard of
   Alex Thompson.

   <p>Hearing a dramatic female sigh, he turned to see Charlotte striding
   into the room. She took a seat in one of the visitor's chairs and
   arranged the dog on her lap. "Everything's settled," she said, as if
   she'd just secured a dinner reservation.

   <p>"Your daughter didn't seem pleased to have me here."

   <p>"She isn't, but she'll get over it." She hadn't really been looking at
   him before, but she focused on him now with a wide-eyed, innocent
   expression that didn't fool him. "What?"

   <p>"When exactly did my name become Bruce?"

   <p>She gave a short tittering laugh. "On my way in to the conference room
   it occurred to me that if I told my daughter your real name, she'd
   ferret out who you were in two seconds. My daughter is no slouch in
   the brains department."

   <p>"But Bruce?"

   <p>She shrugged. "It was all I could come up with on short notice."

   <p>She shouldn't have had to come up with anything. She should have
   leveled with her daughter. But since his pleas to do so had so far
   gone unheeded, he didn't bother. "I heard back from the lab. The only
   fingerprints on the letters belonged to us. They

   were printed on paper you can buy at any office supply store using ink
   you can purchase anywhere."

   <p>"So they weren't helpful."

   <p>"Not in narrowing down any suspects, no."

   <p>She lifted her shoulders and let them fall in a defeated way, dramatic
   even for her. "You see why I need your help. Who knows who could be
   sending those letters?"

   <p>Indeed. She could be mailing herself poisoned pen letters for all he
   knew, but he suspected the fear he sensed in her was real. "Why do you
   want me to hang around the office then, if you are in danger?"

   <p>"You read the notes. `I'll take away every Scarlet thing you own.'
   It's not my business I'm worried about, it's my daughter. She calls
   herself Carly, she always has, but her real name is Scarlet. She needs
   your protection, not me."

   <p>"I'm a P.I. Mrs. Thompson, not a body guard."

   <p>She looked at him with a hint of challenge in her eyes. "Would you let
   anything happen to my daughter?"

   <p>"No."

   <p>"Then that's close enough." She sat forward, clearing her throat.
   "There's one more thing. I don't think you're going to like it."

   <p>Why was he not surprised? "What's that?"

   <p>"I have, in the tiniest way, led my daughter to believe that we are
   sleeping together."

   <p>Not for the first time since he'd met Charlotte Thompson, his temper
   threatened to overflow. "How does one, in the tiniest way, lead
   someone to believe that you are sleeping with someone else?"

   <p>"She assumed and I didn't exactly deny it. It wouldn't have done me
   any good to deny it. She never would have believed me."

   <p>"Why is that?"

   <p>She shot him a droll look. "Have you looked at yourself in the mirror
   lately? And, unfortunately, my daughter thinks of me as some
   nymphomaniac dowager gobbling up young men like a Hoover snaps up dust
   bunnies."

   <p>She pressed her lips together and looked away from him. For the first
   time, he sensed real pain in her. "It's a harmless ruse," she said in
   a quiet voice.

   <p>He wanted to protest. He wanted to get the hell out of there, for as
   sure as he stood there he knew she lied to him. He didn't need to
   stick his neck out for a woman that couldn't even be straight with her
   own daughter. But he'd made two promises to his father. One would have
   to wait while he took care of the other.

   <p>"What do you want me to do?"

   <p>"Stay with her. Tell her you want to go over my itinerary. Whatever."
   She stood, grasping Mr. Jingles in one arm and smoothing her skirt
   with the other.

   <p>"Where are you going?"

   <p>"Friday is facial day. I'll see you at home later." With a swish of
   her hips she was gone.

  

   <p>Once outside in the car, Charlotte relaxed against the Mercedes'
   leather upholstery and let some of the tension she'd felt all day seep
   out of her. It was all arranged. She'd seen to it. Alex should be
   proud of her. She looked heavenward as she always did when she thought
   of her husband. "Finally, Alex, I've done something right."

   <p>She hadn't been a good parent to Carly. She knew that. While Carly's
   friends had thought she had the coolest mother imaginable because she
   didn't nag Carly about her grades or impose curfews like their
   mothers, Carly herself had needed something different. She'd needed
   stability and structure and order. Since she, Charlotte, had been
   incapable of providing it, Carly had created it for herself.

   <p>Charlotte had always admired that about her daughter, but lately, she
   had come to realize that Carly had gone too far. She'd structured her
   life to include nothing but work: no friends, no men, no dates, no
   fun. Charlotte had tried to get her daughter to lighten up, but Carly
   saw every attempt as another example of her mother's frivolity. Now
   they were like the two opposing poles of a magnet, but rather than
   attracting, they repelled. Frankly, Charlotte didn't know what to do
   about it any more.

   <p>Even so, Charlotte had bigger worries than Carly's opinion of her.
   What she did now could make the difference between life and death for
   all of them. If only Jackson hadn't gone snooping around, digging in
   the past. He'd left it alone for all this time. Why now, when the risk
   was so much greater?

   <p>Her sweet Alex had already paid with his life for the answers Jackson
   sought. One of the last things Alex had said to her was to watch out
   for that boy. Alex had known what Jackson didn't: that his father had
   been diagnosed with cancer and wasn't expected to survive. Donovan
   Trent had lasted only a few months longer than Alex had. Newly
   orphaned, the boy had gone to live with an aunt in upstate New York.

   <p>Charlotte had lost track of him, until the phone calls started, the
   ones warning her what would happen if he persisted. She knew the voice
   and the man it belonged to, though she doubted he knew she knew. This
   time, rather than threatening her husband, it was her daughter he
   targeted. And Jackson. She'd had to divert Jackson, make him stop
   looking somehow. All she'd come up with was a crazy plot about someone
   trying to sabotage her business, some competitor threatening to expose
   her for stealing their ideas.

   <p>She was certain he didn't believe her. What sane person would? But
   he'd agreed to help her, which was all that mattered. He would keep
   Carly safe until she could figure out what to do-even if that meant
   telling him the truth. If he would even believe her when she told him.
   She'd gone to the police twenty years ago and they had practically
   laughed in her face. She was on her own now, and that thought
   terrified her most of all.
