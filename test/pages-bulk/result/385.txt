   <h>SECURE UNIT FOR WEST OF SCOTLAND
  <p> A SECURE care unit is to be built in the West of Scotland to serve
   four health board areas.
   <p>In the same week that the public hit out over the NHS Argyll and Clyde
   Board decision to downgrade the Rankin Maternity Unit at Inverclyde
   Royal Hospital, the board have also announced proposals to consult
   with the public before a secure care centre for people with mental
   illness is built.
   <p>The centre will apparently have state of the art security systems with
   CCTV and air lock doors, and staff and visitors will be provided with
   security alarms. A police architect will also be consulted over
   security measures.
   <p>The secure unit will serve four health boards: Argyll and Clyde,
   Ayrshire and Arran, Dumfries and Galloway and Lanarkshire.
   The sites shortlisted are Kirklands Hospital, Bothwell; Dykebar
   Hospital, Paisley and The Medical Rehabilitation Unit, Uddingston, and
   the preferred site will be announced at the end of the year.
   <p>NHS Argyll and Clyde say that they are unable to build and sustain a
   secure unit specifically for this area because only a very small
   number of patients would require to be treated at any one time.
   <p>However, the centre will house a maximum of 36 patients, and the four
   health boards have stated that the resources of the centre will help
   to get these patients back into a normal life.
   <p>They have also stated that the new specialised building will serve not
   only those who require more care and security than they are given in
   local or state hospitals, but criminals who are in prison and have a
   mental illness.
   <p>A spokesperson from NHS Argyll and Clyde said: "We need to localise
   mental health services and a secure unit in the West of Scotland for
   people with mental health problems will ensure that we provide this
   service."
   <h>ALL ABOARD
   <p>SEA Cadet Training Ship T.S. Royalist visited Cowal last Wednesday,
   docking at Holy Loch Marina for one night before sailing on to
   Ardrossan where she changed her crew.
   <p>The 32 year old ship was designed by Colin Mudie and specialises in
   offering sea cadets the adventure and challenge of life at sea,
   combined with the skills and essential teamwork required to sail a
   square rigged vessel. Nearly 1,000 youngsters, most of whom are aged
   between 14 and 16, sail aboard the brig every year.
   <p>The ship, which takes kids on trips around the British Isles, started
   her journey at Inverness before making stopovers at Ardrossan and then
   on to her home port of Gosport.
   <p>Alan Burt, Secretary of the Square Rigger Club - which is a charity
   that helps provide bursaries for sea cadets participating on the
   voyage - commented on the scheme: "The chance to set sail aboard this
   magnificent ship is a fantastic experience for sea cadets from all
   over Britain.
   <p>"We provide finance and help supplement the permanent crew by
   providing volunteers to help out on the ship. Last year alone we
   invested £14,000 to help towards the cost of travel."
   <p>Anyone looking to make donations to the charity, or who wish to become
   a volunteer, can contact Alan Burt on 01875 852300 or write to him at
   64 Douglas Road, Longniddry, East Lothian, EN32 0LJ
   <h>LOCH FYNE OYSTERS SERVED AT HARRODS
   <p>LOCH Fyne Oysters will be a name rolling off the tongue of the rich
   and famous next Tuesday, as the company's produce will be showcased at
   London's most famous department store for the `Clearly Caledonian'
   promotion.
   <p>The 10 day event will involve 51 of Scotland's finest food and drink
   producers being chosen to take part in the high profile showpiece at
   Harrods. This ranges from household names like Walkers and Baxters to
   small, one man operations.
   Maggie McGinlay, director of food and drink, Scottish Enterprise,
   said: "We are delighted that the spotlight is being put on Scottish
   food and drink by Harrods.
   "Scotland produces a fantastic range of premium quality produce and
   the tempting array in-store will give food-lovers the chance to sample
   a selection of our splendid Scottish fare."
   <p>Loch Fyne Oysters, which are based at Cairndow and partly owned by
   workers, have an annual turnover of £8 million.
   Produce from Loch Fyne Oysters has made it to some of the most
   exclusive restaurants in the UK, as well as being featured on the menu
   list of GNER trains.
   <p>A spokesperson for Loch Fyne Oysters commented on their inclusion in
   the event, saying: "We are glad that we are being extensively
   recognised, as the west Highlands produce the best sea food in the
   UK."
   <p>Harrods Chairman Mohamed Al Fayed considers Scotland to be his
   favourite holiday destination.
   <p>He added: "I have always had a special fondness for Scotland - its
   people are very agreeable, the countryside is spectacular and the
   history is rich and unique.
   <p>"Scotland has untold riches to offer, most especially as the producer
   of some of the finest foods in the United Kingdom. I am very proud
   that Harrods is able to host this event to showcase the very finest
   Scottish produce."
   <h>RAMBLERS FACE A `TICK'-ING TIMEBOMB
   <p>RAMBLERS in Scotland are being warned to be on their guard against a
   potential killer disease spread by ticks.
   <p>The disease, which is generated by the tiny bugs, is called Lyme
   disease, and instances have increased more than 40 fold in Scotland in
   the past decade.
   <p>The Highlands have one of the highest rates of the disease in Northern
   Europe, with 16 cases per 100,000 people.
   <p>Lyme causes facial paralysis, arthritis and can lead to heart failure.
   Early signs include red blotches, flu-like symptoms and aching joints.
   <p>A spokesperson for the Scottish Tourist Board said: "In every tourist
   information centre in Scotland we supply anti-midge spray and cream
   for bugs such as ticks.
   "We also advise all walkers who intend to walk in the countryside to
   use these products, as we are aware of the problems that have been
   associated with ticks."
   <h>EURO FESTIVAL
   <p>ON July 19 almost 1,000 participants converged in Schifflange,
   Luxembourg to take part in the week long annual European People's
   Festival. Dunoon and Cowal, who represented the UK, sent a delegation
   of 56 participants to take part in sporting competitions, business
   exhibitions, culinary and culture presentations.
   <p>The Festival celebrations began on Sunday, July 20 with an Ecumenical
   Church Service, followed by a parade of all 14 participating nations
   through the streets of Schifflange. The Parade was a colourful event
   with each nation displaying their country's flag and presenting
   impromptu cultural displays of dance and music.
   Following speeches by Roland Hoferlin, President of the Luxembourg
   Team and Roland Schriener, Mayor of Schifflange, the EU Flag was
   raised to signify the opening of the Festival and mark the unity of
   the `People of Europe.'
   <p>Sporting events began on Monday with handball and petanque. The
   Scottish delegation participated well in the handball competition with
   Allan Davidson (captain) directing a team who had no previous
   experience of this fast and exciting game. As expected, the Luxembourg
   team dominated this event taking first place with Scotland finishing a
   healthy 11th place.
   <p>The petanque team of Tony Black (captain) and Ricky and Nicky Reynolds
   fought hard in the petanque competition, playing against experienced
   European teams and much to their credit finished in a satisfying fifth
   place.
   <p>Tuesday's sporting competitions were duathlon, football and badminton.
   Local badminton stars Gordon McKinven (captain), Paul Turner, Kirsty
   Turner and Christina English played superbly throughout the day's
   competition winning all their games comfortably. However, when faced
   with old rivals Luxembourg in a fast and exhausting final they were
   edged out in a thrilling contest and took second place. The duathlon
   team of Adam MacKellar (captain), Elaine and Marie Caldwell and
   Anthony Andrews gave an excellent performance on a circuit which was
   tricky for both cyclists and runners. Luxembourg again dominated this
   event with the Cowal Europe team taking 13th place.
   <p>The football team managed by John Caldwell played some excellent games
   under very hot temperatures. Their games were vehemently fought and
   the team finished an encouraging eighth place.
   <p>On Tuesday evening the Scottish delegation presented to a packed hall
   their much acclaimed cultural presentation overseen by Cultural
   Convenor Allan Davidson. The show included performances by Dunoon's
   local ceilidh band, `Canned Haggis,' country and Highland dancers,
   pipers and drummers. The finale included an alternative Sword Dance to
   music from the Scottish band the `Proclaimers,' which received a
   standing ovation by the European audience.
   <p>Thursday marked the end of the sporting competitions with tennis,
   basketball and shooting. The tennis team of Robert McGregor (captain),
   Lynn MacFarlane, Paul Turner and Christina English played in a series
   of singles and mixed doubles competitions. Their aim was to gain as
   many points as possible in a 20 minute tie-break. Again Luxembourg
   dominated this competition and Scotland finished in ninth place.
   <p>The basketball competition met with some unexpected complications,
   play being postponed due to some of the players being taller than the
   basket height, and new baskets having to be delivered and fitted! The
   Cowal Europe team, captained by Derek Henderson played well under very
   stiff competition and managed to gain a respectable tenth place.
   <p>The shooting competition proved to be an interesting experience,
   described by the Eurofestival reporters as a `meeting between friends
   in a loose atmosphere.' The team of Alan Montgomery (captain), David
   Marshall and Kirsten Gibb displayed a high level of concentration in
   this new event and finished a reasonable 12th place in another
   Luxembourg dominated event.
   <p>From Sunday to Friday the business stands were open in the Town Hall
   Square. The Scottish stand managed by Pev McChlery, Ricky and Nicky
   Reynolds promoted Dunoon, Cowal and Argyll and Bute to enthralled
   Luxembourg inhabitants and festival participants. Home-made shortbread
   generously donated by the `Royal Marine Hotel' was available for
   tasting along with a number of selected whiskies. Face painting by
   Karen Gibb, with an emphasis on Scottish culture, attracted many
   youngsters and parents to the stand. Amongst the distinguished guests
   who visited the Scottish Business Stand were the Swedish and Irish
   Ambassadors who came to support the European People's Festival and
   experience the unity and the cultural diversity of the EU. RTL News
   covered the business stand arena and televised interviews with
   participants, organisers and guests.
   <p>Each day different countries presented culinary demonstrations in the
   business stand arena. On Thursday our cooks Margaret Montgomery and
   Margaret Caldwell, using Schifflange produce, prepared both trifle and
   cranachan desserts, eagerly devoured by a fascinated audience.
   <p>Friday brought to close a wonderful week with our European friends.
   Many friendships had been made and renewed. Fun events on this day
   included in-line skating, table tennis, wheelchair basketball
   demonstrations and chess (on giant chess boards). One thousand people
   attended the final dinner and presentations, and the European People's
   Festival ended with a fantastic firework display.
   <p>The committee of Cowal Europe would like to thank Gordon Higgins;
   Canned Haggis Ceilidh Band; The Royal Marine Hotel; Dunoon Argyll Pipe
   Band; Ardentinny Hotel; Bob's football programmes and Buchanan's
   sweets.
   <p>In 2004 the European People's Festival will be held in Upplands Vasby,
   Sweden. Adverts will be placed in the Dunoon Observer in December, and
   anyone interested in participating is encouraged to apply to the
   committee.
