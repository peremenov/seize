<h>Homicide Life on the Street - The
   Complete Season 6

   <h>Review by Jeffrey Robinson 

   <h>The Sixth Season

   <p>For those who aren't familiar with the series, Homicide revolves
   around the Baltimore Police Department Homicide Unit. The television
   series was adapted from David Simon's novel Homicide: A Year on the
   Killing Streets and through the eyes of producers Barry Levinson, Tom
   Fontana, Henry Bromell, and Paul Attanasio, we get one hell of a show.
   It's a very dramatic series that touches upon the daily lives of the
   homicide unit, their cases, and their daily interactions. The sixth
   season of Homicide: Life on the Street continues to bring the same
   high-paced drama found in the previous seasons. Like previous season,
   the there are some new characters introduced, old ones revisited, and
   some downright interesting stories.

   <p>This season builds from the previous seasons. At the end of season
   five, the brass implemented a policy that required detectives to
   rotate between different units. From our season five cast, Frank
   Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Tim Bayliss (Kyle Secor) went to
   robbery, Meldrick Lewis (Clark Johnson) went to vice, Mike Kellerman
   (Reed Diamond) went to auto, Howard went to the fugitive squad, and
   John Munch (Richard Belzer) stayed in homicide with Al Giardello
   (Yaphet Kotto). In the beginning of the season, the detectives return
   to the homicide division, except Kay Howards (Melissa Leo) who does
   not appear in this season. There are also new detectives added to the
   homicide squad. Most of these new characters aren't exactly new, as
   they appeared in the fifth season. Paul Falsone (Jon Seda) is a young
   rookie, who seems overzealous in the pursuit of the truth. Stu Gharty
   (Peter Gerety) is an older cop, who adds his experience to the bunch.
   While not officially on cast, former narcotics detective Terri Stivers
   (Toni Lewis) appears a lot throughout this season. Finally, Laura
   Ballard (Callie Thorne) is a veteran cop from Seattle. In addition,
   ASA Ed Danvers (Zeljko Ivanek) and Chief Medical Examiner Julianna Cox
   (Michelle Forbes) return in a few episodes to help out.

   <p>At first, I did not enjoy the change of cast. I found the way the
   season opened a little odd in the manner in which the new roles were
   defined. First we have a set of new detectives, and they are
   immediately portrayed as superior detectives. While the previous
   season regulars of Homicide were on leave, the new detectives were
   cleaning house, as case clearance rates have never been better. Under
   this light, our new detectives appear to be quite the all-star bunch.
   However, as the season progresses, the focus returns to our more
   regular roles such as Pembleton and Bayliss. The new detectives do not
   shine as the season goes on (even close to the degree they were
   projected in the beginning), which makes it odd that they were even
   regarded so highly of. Still, it is quite fun to see the homicide unit
   regular's rather cold welcome when they return. While, I wasn't too
   hip on the new roles at first, they soon grew on me. I began to enjoy
   their diverse personalities and how they complimented and interacted
   with the other regulars.

   <p>The stories that are told in this season are both gripping and
   entertaining. The season does well with both episodic storylines and
   large story arcs. There are plenty of wonderful tales to be told
   surrounding the interactions of these detectives. The season opens
   with a very with a powerful three part episode that guest stars James
   Earl Jones. In it, all of the new roles are introduced to the series
   and the regulars return from their respective assignments for another
   powerful season. This episode introduces a great story that spans the
   entire season. It's all about revenge, and no one in homicide is safe.
   The story also includes plenty of corruption in the police force, with
   a great intrigue of lies and deceit that end with a full on war
   between the good guys and bad guys. It's the most riveting story of
   the season. I dare not speak about it more, because it is something I
   would have to ruin.

   <p>After the opening three part episode, the season continues with a
   fantastic episode, "The Subway", which won a Peabody Award. The
   episode guest stars Vincent D'Onofrio (Law & Order: Criminal Intent).
   In it, a very powerful and intense dialogue occurs between Pembleton
   and a man who gets put in a situation that he probably won't survive.
   It's one of the most powerful and dramatic episodes I've ever watched.
   As for the rest of the season, it continues with more dramatic and
   riveting looks into a group of homicide detectives.

   <p>I felt that this season was very strong in the manner it presented its
   stories and characters. While I was at first skeptical about the new
   roles, I soon found that they were just as likeable as the previous
   season regulars. Like the third season, this season was terribly hard
   to set down. Every episode left me wanting more.

   <h>The DVD

   <h>Video:
   <p>This DVD release is presented in its original television aspect of
   1.33:1 ratio full frame color. The entire series was filmed using 16mm
   handheld cameras to give a documentary facade. The picture suffers
   from a high amount of grain, which is somewhat expected for earlier
   television series. However, this look gives the show a rough feeling
   that truly captures the show's dramatic ambience. In comparison to
   previous season releases, the quality is slightly better.

   <h>Audio:
   <p>The audio in this feature is presented in English 2.0 Dolby Digital
   stereo surround. The dialogue is very crisp and clean with only a
   slightly noticeable hiss. There are no subtitles presented with this
   feature, nor is it closed caption enabled.

   <h>Extras:
   <p>There are not a lot of extras included with this release. In fact,
   there are only two and both are related to the award winning episode
   "The Subway". The first is an audio commentary with James Yoshimura
   and Gary Fleder. The other extra is a full length PBS documentary
   entitled "Anatomy of Homicide". It runs for about one hour and eleven
   minutes. I thought it was a great documentary about the series and a
   look into the cast and crew. However, it mostly focused on James
   Yoshimura and the development of "The Subway" episode and Homicide:
   Life on the Streets's fight to survive on network television. While
   not a huge variety for extras, I thought that they were great.

   <h>Final Thoughts:
   <p>Like the third season of Homicide, I found that this season was very
   intense. The content whether a story arc or in an episodic format was
   both gripping and entertaining. In fact, I found that I couldn't stop
   watching and I think it's one of the series' best.
