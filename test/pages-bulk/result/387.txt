   <h>Salon Series
   <p>We're hosting another series of facilitated Ã¢ yet casual - group
   discussions about different topics related to sex. We'll start with
   some wine and cheese and informal mingling, then sit down to talk
   about that night's topic. It might be philosophical, cultural,
   political or even spiritual. No lectures, no demonstrations. We'll
   throw out some good questions and let the conversation flow. No
   experience or special knowledge is necessary. Just curiosity and a
   willingness to share your ideas and listen to others. The salons are
   open to everyone over 18 and are free events.

   <p>Tuesday October 10, 2006 | 7pm (Discussion starts at 7:30)
   <p>Is there a difference between erotica and pornography? If so, what is
   it? What makes something pornographic as opposed to erotic? Why do we
   care if there is a difference?

   <h>What Is Sex?
   <p>Tuesday November 7, 2006 | 7pm (Discussion starts at 7:30)
   <p>How do we define sex? How have definitions of sex changed (or not?)
   over history - or over our own lifetimes? How does our definition of
   sex affect our sex lives, our relationships, our identity, our laws
   and policies?

   <p>Just Can't Get Enough Tuesday December 5, 2006 | 7pm (Discussion
   starts at 7:30) What do we know about polyamory and what do we think
   about it? Is it possible to love and be committed to more than one
   person? How does having sexual relationships with more than one person
   affect our relationship(s)? What are these sexual relationships like?
   How has polyamory been defined in history, literature, the media, our
   laws, etc.?

   <h>Instructor Bios:
   <p>When she was 12 years old, Dimitra brought her copy of Nancy Friday's
   "My Secret Garden," a collection of women's sexual fantasies, to share
   with to her fascinated junior high classmates over lunch. This was,
   perhaps, a pretty obvious indicator of her future interests in sex
   education. Dimitra has a masters in social work and is currently
   pursuing certification as a sex educator. She helped to create the
   Early to Bed Pleasureware Party program

   <p>Emily Gordon is a Licensed Professional Counselor with a masters in
   couples and family therapy. Her main interests are in self care, life
   transitions, family conflict, and GLBTQ issues, and she has
   facilitated workshops on topics ranging from conflict resolution to
   self-esteem for women and men in various settings. Emily is also a
   freelance writer of feminist essays and erotica, and has been
   published in several magazines, including JANE and BUST.

   <p>Rebecca has enthusiastically worked as a sex educator for Early to Bed
   since 2003. A women's studies graduate of DePaul University, Rebecca
   enjoys anti-racist activism, blurring gender lines, and radical
   feminism with a sense of humor, spreading sex-positive information,
   yummy vegan food, and pugs.
