   <h>Altitude Illness - Cerebral Syndromes
   <p>Last Updated: May 16, 2003

   <p>Synonyms and related keywords: acute mountain sickness, AMS, mal de
   montagne, soroche, high-altitude cerebral edema, HACE

   <h>Pathophysiology:
   <p>Rapid ascent to high altitude overtaxes the body's ability to tolerate
   the decreasing availability of oxygen. The cerebral forms of altitude
   illness appear to be due to hypoxia-induced changes in blood-brain
   barrier permeability, which results in a vasogenic brain edema.

   <h>Mortality/Morbidity:
   <p>AMS is a self-limiting disease and generally resolves in 1-5 days.
   HACE may be fatal within 1-2 days unless treated by immediate descent.
   Recovery is usually complete, although in very rare cases, patients
   with either severe or prolonged HACE may have persistent neurological
   deficits. A small percentage of very ill patients may die even with
   proper treatment (i.e., descent, oxygen, steroids).

   <h>History:
   <p>AMS and HACE occur in the context of a recent ascent to altitudes
   higher than about 2500 m (8,200 ft). Additionally, patients often have
   a history of rapid ascent, with sleeping elevations increased by more
   than 300 m (1,000 ft) per night above 3000 m (9,800 ft). Patients
   frequently lack the spontaneous diuresis normally seen at altitude.

   <p>Normal effects of exposure to altitude include the following:
   <l>Exertional dyspnea
   <l>Spontaneous diuresis
   <l>Nocturnal periodic breathing (e.g., Cheyne-Stokes respirations)
   <l>Frequent awakening at night
   <l>Weird or vivid dreams

   <p>In the context of a recent ascent, the diagnosis of AMS is implied by
   headache plus at least 1 of the following symptoms:
   <l>Gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., anorexia, nausea, vomiting)
   <l>Light-headedness or dizziness
   <l>Weakness or fatigue
   <l>Insomnia

   <p>Diagnosis of HACE is implied by the following criteria:
   <p>Ascent with symptoms of AMS is the most common history.
   HACE may evolve after a very rapid ascent despite the absence of AMS.
   In this context "rapid ascent" means significantly more than the
   recommended 300 meters (1,000 ft) per day; the actual ascent rate in
   meters per hour probably is not important.

   <p>HACE commonly occurs after the onset of severe high-altitude pulmonary
   edema (HAPE), probably due to severe hypoxemia. Confusion, lassitude,
   and other mental status changes implied by patient's history could
   indicate HACE.
   History of gait ataxia may be a sign of HACE.

   <h>Physical:
   <h>Acute mountain sickness (AMS)
   <p>Patients appear ill but otherwise have no characteristic physical
   findings. Neurologic examination results (especially mental status and
   gait) are normal. Cardiac rate does not correlate with acclimatization
   or AMS.
   <p>Pulmonary crackles may be present in some patients.
   <p>Fever is absent.
   <p>High-altitude cerebral edema
   <p>Suspect the diagnosis in a patient with symptoms of AMS who develops
   gait ataxia (i.e., unable to walk heel-to-toe in a straight line) or
   mental status changes.
   <p>Regardless of AMS symptoms, a combination of ataxia and mental status
   changes suggests HACE.

   <p>... In rare cases, focal neurologic signs (i.e., cranial nerve III
   palsy, cranial nerve VI palsy) appear in end-stage HACE, although they
   are more suggestive of other causes of focal deficits at altitude
   (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack [TIA], migraine, brain
   neoplasm).

  

   
   <h>Altitude Illness - Pulmonary Syndromes
   <p>Last Updated: May 16, 2003

   <p>Synonyms and related keywords: high-altitude pulmonary edema, HAPE,
   high-altitude cough, high-altitude bronchitis, high-altitude cerebral
   edema, HACE

   <h>Pathophysiology:
   <p>HAPE is a noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.
   <p>... the disease is thought to be caused by patchy hypoxic pulmonary
   vasoconstriction (likely due to local shunting response to hypoxia)
   with consequent localized overperfusion combined with hypoxic
   permeability of pulmonary capillary walls. These changes result in
   high pulmonary artery pressure, high permeability, and leak into the
   alveoli. HAPE is quite distinct from other forms of pulmonary edema
   and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

   <h>Mortality/Morbidity:
   <p>HAPE may be fatal within a few hours unless treated by descent or
   oxygen, and it is the most common cause of death related to high
   altitude. As with high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), recovery is
   usually complete, although, even with proper treatment (i.e., oxygen,
   prompt descent), a small percentage of very ill patients die. Patients
   who recover have rapid clearing of edematous fluid and do not develop
   fibrosis or other long-term sequelae.

   <p>High-altitude cough may be disabling at altitude because of paroxysmal
   coughing, chest pain from intercostal muscle strains and/or
   cough-induced rib fractures, and insomnia. High-altitude cough
   resolves with descent.

   <h>History:
   <p>HAPE occurs in the context of a recent ascent to altitudes higher than
   about 2500 m (8,200 ft). Additionally, patients often have a history
   of rapid ascent, with sleeping elevations increased by more than 300 m
   (1,000 ft) per night above 3000 m (9,800 ft). Patients frequently lack
   the spontaneous diuresis normally seen at altitude.

   <p>Normal effects of altitude exposure include the following:
   <l>Exertional dyspnea
   <l>Spontaneous diuresis
   <l>Nocturnal periodic breathing (e.g., Cheyne-Stokes respirations)
   <l>Frequent awakening at night
   <l>Weird or vivid dreams

   <p>HAPE occurs in the first 2-4 days of ascent to a new elevation, most
   often on the second night. HAPE typically worsens at night. The
   diagnosis requires 2 or more of the signs listed under Physical as
   well as 2 of the symptoms from the following list.

   <p>Weakness, fatigue, or decreased exercise performance (most common and
   often the earliest sign)
   <l>Cough
   <l>Dyspnea at rest
   <l>Chest tightness or congestion
   <l>High-altitude cough
   <l>Paroxysmal cough, sometimes forceful enough to fracture 1 or more ribs
   <l>Frequently productive of purulent sputum
   <l>Absence of fever
   <l>Absence of dyspnea at rest
   <l>May lead to compromise of the airway

   <h>Physical Diagnosis:
   <p>In addition to 2 or more of the previously listed symptoms, HAPE is
   diagnosed by presence of at least 2 of the following signs:
   <l>Crackles or wheezing in at least 1 lung field
   <l>Central cyanosis or significant arterial oxygen desaturation relative
   to altitude
   <l>Tachycardia
   <l>Tachypnea

   <p>Other findings in HAPE may include the following:
   <l>Fever (relatively common)
   <l>Orthopnea
   <l>Pink/frothy sputum (a late finding)
   <l>High-altitude cough
   <l>No fever
   <l>Lungs are clear to auscultation
   <l>No cyanosis or desaturation

   <h>Causes:
   <l>High-altitude pulmonary edema
   <l>Rapid ascent
   <l>More risk at higher altitudes
   <l>Low hypoxic ventilatory response
   <l>Cold exposure (raises pulmonary artery pressure)
   <l>Physical exertion (exacerbates the condition)
   <l>Congenital absence of right pulmonary artery
   <l>High-altitude cough
   <l>Unknown etiology
   <l>Potential causes - Dry or cold air, bronchospasm, altered cough
   sensitivity Worse at higher altitudes

   

   
   <h>Altitude Basics, 101

   <p>Performing all forms of outdoor activity becomes an increasing
   challenge as altitude increases. Contrary to popular belief, your
   ability to perform at higher altitude is tied less to your physical
   condition, and tied more to your genetic stock. Certain medical
   conditions such as asthma and high blood pressure can be aggravated by
   altitude. If you use a little common sense and do some preparation,
   you will find that you will be able to perform most outdoor activities
   all the way to 15,000 feet with little discomfort and medical
   problems.

   <h>Sea Level to 3,500 Feet (1068 metres)
   <p>A vast majority of the North American population lives in this
   altitude range. Most people, except for those with extreme
   cardiopulmonary disorders can perform almost any activity at this
   level. People who live at sea level will experience almost no
   noticeable ill effects when moving within this altitude range where
   the air pressure is around 12 psi (pounds per square inch).

   <h>3,500 Feet to 6,000 Feet (1830 metres)
   <p>Most people of ordinary health will have little problems at this
   altitude. People who reside in areas that are below 2,500 feet may
   start to notice some breathing difficulty as they move above the 5,000
   feet mark. People who have cardiopulmonary disorders may have serious
   problems in this altitude range and should consult a physician before
   visiting or engaging in outdoor sporting activity. Women who are
   pregnant may also experience problems at this altitude due to the
   increased demand for oxygen that the fetus puts on their systems.

   <h>6,000 Feet to 10,000 Feet (3050 metres)
   <p>In this altitude range some people may start to experience problems
   related to altitude. AMS, or Acute Mountain Sickness symptoms may set
   in at any altitude above 6,000 feet. At 10,000 feet, the atmosphere is
   only 50% of that found at sea level. Breathing can become difficult,
   even for those in good physical condition. Women who are pregnant and
   people with cardiopulmonary disorders should consult a physician
   before spending any time at these altitudes.

   <h>10,000 Feet to 14,000 Feet (4270 metres)
   <p>Once you get above 10,000 feet the oxygen content in the atmosphere
   has reached levels that can be dangerously thin. Not only is AMS a
   possibility, but the risk of HAPE or High Altitude Pulmonary Edema
   greatly increases over 12,000 feet. To put this in proper perspective,
   private pilots who fly over 10,000 feet are required to use
   supplemental oxygen. Most people that do mountaineering will climb in
   these altitudes. Pregnant women, children under the age of two, and
   people who have cardiopulmonary disorders should not go above 10,000
   feet in altitude. Serious medical complications can occur in this
   range.

   <h>14,000 Feet to 18,000 Feet (5490 metres)
   <p>Above 14,000 feet, a person enters an extreme altitude. The atmosphere
   can be only 40% of that found at sea level, and air pressure can drop
   to below 10 psi, causing physiological stress on the body. AMS, HAPE,
   and HACE or High Altitude Cerebral Edema can all be experienced in
   this altitude range. Typically in North America, only extreme
   mountaineers will exceed these altitudes for any period of time. This
   altitude range can be dangerous for any one, even those in good
   physical condition.

   <h>18,000 Feet and Above
   <p>Altitude above 18,000 feet is also called, the death zone. As the air
   pressure falls to as low as 7 psi, the body, even with supplemental
   oxygen literally starts to die. The severe onset of HAPE and HACE can
   occur at these altitudes and AMS symptoms are almost continuously
   experienced. Only highly experienced mountaineers should venture into
   these altitudes, and a constant vigil has to be made for HAPE and HACE
   symptoms, with a focus on HACE symptoms as part of the symptoms for
   HACE is clouded judgment.

  
   
   <h>A corner of paradise
   <h>Welcome to Le Village Catalan.

   <p>Whether you prefer an activity holiday, nature and culture holiday,
   relaxation, spa treatment, or a language course, you will find our
   village to be an ideal base.

   <h>General information
   <p>Le Village Catalan is a small village of 12 houses in the
   microclimatic foothills of snow-capped Canigou in the Pyrenees,
   between the ski resorts and the Mediterranean. It is known to have the
   best climate in France, with an average 300 days of sunshine per year,
   and it is rich on history, culture and natural beauty.

   <p>In the past Vernet-les-Bains has been the favoured health resort of
   the British aristocracy, witnessed by the extravagant architecture of
   the casino and the parks. Europes largest wilderness area, the
   Pyrenees start just behind the village, with excellent opportunities
   for leisure activities, from hiking through mountain biking and
   fishing. A nearby waterfall has been named after the British -
   Cascades des Anglais. Famous Carcassonne, the tax free mini state
   Andorra, Spain and the Mediterranean beaches can be reached on
   day-trips.

   <p>Our little village is situated 5 minutes walk from Vernet-les-Bains
   centre, with all facilities - shops, restaurants and cafés, a sports
   centre, casino, thermal spa . Le Village Catalan comprises one, two
   and three bedroom houses on two levels, containing lounge with wooden
   beams and fireplace, kitchen, bathroom and all are equipped with
   simple but robust furnishing.

   <p>The architecture is medieval Catalan, but built as recent as 1965-1975
   - it took ten years to build - and partly refurbished in 1998-2003.
   Each house is different and half the houses are built in granite
   stone. Each house has a private, sunny terrace with spectacular,
   unobstructible views of Vernet Les Bains, the valleys and the
   mountains. Six of the houses also have a private courtyard.

   


   <h>Home in Wiler, Switzerland.
   <h>Resort Development

   <p>Living at an altitude of 2000 metres in Switzerland - skiing at up to
   3111 metres. We are building exclusive chalets and apartments right
   next to the ski slope in Wiler, Valais (Lötschental, 1 hour south of
   Berne)! With a unique mountain panorama. You can live the chalets and
   apartments all over the year.

   <p>We are building exclusive, comfortably furnished chalets and
   apartments adjacent to the cable car station at 2000 meters, with a
   clear view of the mountain panorama that is guaranteed into the
   future. The sympathetic architecture fits in with the traditional
   housing structure of the Alpine pasture regions and meets individual
   requirements in respect of comfort. Scattered around in the
   neighbourhood are further chalets and mountain restaurants. A new
   clubhouse with restaurant and bar is planned.

   <p>From November 2003, a cable car runs up to 3111 meters. A choice of 4
   types of chalets and 6 types of apartments is anticipated (see above).
   Construction has already begun. The first show house is now ready to
   be visited or purchased immediately.

   
   <h>C. E. Bartlett Pty. Ltd
   <h>Portable Altitude Chamber

   <h>Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS)
   <p>As we ascend above 2500 metres (8000 feet) our bodies must acclimatise
   to the decreasing amount of oxygen available. Failure to acclimatise
   can result in AMS.

   <p>The symptoms of AMS may include any of the following: headache,
   fatigue, loss of appetite, shortness of breath, cough, dizziness,
   blurred vision, vomiting, etc. The intensity and severity of these
   symptoms will vary, but can very quickly become extremely serious and
   even fatal.

   <p>The only treatment for AMS is to descend to a lower altitude.

   <p>However, there are many situations where immediate descent is
   difficult if not impossible, due to the hazards of weather, lack of
   manpower, difficult terrain or geography such as a plateau.

   <p>The pressure chamber concept has been around for 20 years or more, yet
   the majority of trekkers and mountaineers going to high altitudes do
   so without this essential piece of safety equipment. The PAC is an
   Australian product, aimed at trekking groups, both private and
   commercial, as well as expeditions to high altitude. It is an answer
   to the need for an effective, simple, durable, lightweight and
   affordable pressure chamber for the treatment of AMS.

   <h>Effective
   <p>PAC technology has been shown to be highly effective in the reversal
   of symptoms of AMS. Depending on the starting altitude, simulated
   descents of about 2000 metres (6000 feet) are achieved at the
   operating pressure of 2 PSI above ambient pressure.

   <h>Simple
   <p>The PAC has been designed to be as simple to operate as possible. One
   operator can perform a complete treatment cycle on their own. A
   summary of the instructions found in the operator's manual are printed
   on the PAC itself, while all the valves are clearly labelled to avoid
   confusion.

   <h>Light
   <p>The PAC, all up with pump, hose, manual repair kit and storage bag
   weighs in at less than 8 kgs.

   <p>PAC technology buys time and can stabilise or reverse severe symptoms
   of AMS before (or while) descent is undertaken.

   <h>Nutrition of the Sportsman
   <h>The Omega-3 fatty acids of the performance
   

   <h>"The Fatty Acids Polyinsaturés: Essential for health ".
   

   <h>INFLUENCE PHYSICAL EXERCISE AND HYPOXIA ON BLOOD FLUIDITY:
   <p>[ Blood thickness is inversely dependent upon the membrane rigidity of
   the blood cells, which is conversely dependent on the rigidity of
   double-layered lipidic of the membrane of the red globule. A rise in
   saturated fatty acid connections lowers the number of non-saturated
   double connections and contributes to cell rigidity.]

   <p>[ Endurance exercises increases the rigidity of the red blood cells,
   providing an increase in the thickness of the blood. Hypoxia (lowered
   oxygen volume) of altitude reduces plasmic volume and induces a
   reduction in the thickness of the blood.]

   <p>[ Increases in duration and intensity of exercise together with
   increases in altitude, increases saturated fatty acid presence and
   decreases polyunsaturated fatty acids -- acid arachidonic (omega-6),
   EPA and DHA (omega-3). This increases membrane saturation with the
   amount of omega-6 and omega-3 correlating with an increase in red
   blood cell membrane rigidity. (similar in influence to an increase in
   cholesterol presence) and reducing the blood capacity to absorb and
   retain oxygen.]

   <p>[ During prolonged exercise, and at higher altitudes, blood cell
   changes produce reduced capillary efficiency, particularly in the
   lungs, liver, and spleen and reduced ability to carry and transfer
   oxygen to peripheral tissues. This induces an anaemia of iron
   deficiency by rupture of the red blood cells in the capillaries, under
   the effect of the rise in the cardiac flow and the blood pressure. ]

   <h>INFLUENCE of FISH OIL ABSORPTION ON PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE
   

   <p>[ Supplementation of diet with fish oil (omega-3 = tuna, salmon,
   sardines, mackerel, lake trout, walnuts, pecans, almonds) suppresses
   the harmful blood fluidity changes encouraged by endurance exercises
   and high altitudes.]

   

   <p>[ Fish oils reduce capillary resistance to oxygen uptake and increase
   blood circulation to peripheral areas. The efficiency of oxygen
   transfer from blood to muscle cells is enhanced by a reduction in
   tissue rigidity and an increase in red blood cell presence at the
   capillaries.]

   <p>[ At higher altitudes and during endurance exercises, fish oils
   increase the oxygen desaturation of the haemoglobin, and, increases
   the blood concentration of lactic acid ... the consequence of
   metabolism of glucose (stored energy in cellular sugars). Also,
   adrenalin receptors on the cellular surfaces are sensitised by the
   addition of omega-3 ( = tuna, salmon, sardines, mackerel, lake trout,
   walnuts, pecans, almonds) fish oils making glucose metabolism easier
   and faster.]

   <h>PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES
   <p>[ For altitudes over 2000 m and for high endurance activities, a
   supplementation of 250 g of omega-3 fish oils 3 to 5 times per week (
   = tuna, salmon, sardines, mackerel, lake trout, walnuts, pecans,
   almonds) is beneficial. To avoid a vitamin E deficiency from arising
   from the exercise and the additional polyunsaturated fatty acids, a
   supplementation with vitamin E is required. These changes will provide
   for better performance.]

   <h>COMMENT
   <p>Release of mercury from cellular binding can be enhanced by remaining
   at an altitude of 1800 to 2000 metres (5,800 to 6,400 feet) for a
   period of not less than 1 week with an early daily fluctuation by
   travel down to 0 to 100 metres and return within 4 to 6 hours. The
   early fluctuations encourage greater permeability of the cell wall for
   the release of mercury and other toxins. Living at the reduced
   pressure altitude facilitates the release of these toxins from the
   cells. 

   <p>It can be fatal to not be aware of the hazards/cautions and to ignore
   their significance. Detoxing too quickly can induce severe symptoms,
   panic response, and acute depression. Pacing is imperative.

   <h>HAZARDS / CAUTIONS
   <p>The reduced air pressure fluctuation pattern and the moderate term
   higher altitude living arrangement is best NOT to be considered or
   acted upon UNLESS the individual either has accurate access to
   Spiritual Guidance and has been guided to take this action, OR, has
   been cleared by their physician who is aware of the potential health
   difficulties and challenges. 

   <p>IF your are aware that you have a low heart function (below 60%
   efficiency) and/or low lung function (below 60% efficiency), the
   likelihood of you experiencing altitude illness symptoms at the 1800
   to 2000 metre (5,800 to 6,400 feet) level is HIGH.

   <p>High cholesterol level and/or low blood pressure can be equally
   contributing factors to hypoxia and altitude sickness. It is
   imperative to remain self-directed and calm and take measures and
   supplements as indicated by Spiritual Guidance or accurate muscle
   testing if the symptoms are not to increase in severity due to panic.

   <p>IF you are aware that you likely have residual mercury cellular
   loading, systemic or organ specific cellular contamination by fungi,
   bacterial, or FUIRERIA parasitic forms ... EXPECT that you will
   experience severe symptoms of their presence and release.

   <p>Tobacco smoke, air pollution, certain toxic chemicals, some drugs and
   dry air (common at higher altitudes) all serve to decrease the healthy
   activity of the cilia of the respiratory tract and increase the
   likelihood of local viruses gaining entry further into the human body
   than would be possible with a less compromised lifesystem.

   <p>Ensure that you have an adequate range and quantity of supplements for
   the detoxing of these contaminations from your blood and lymph, or,
   your health will be endangered to a severe or fatal level. Do NOT
   expect local physicians and health care workers to understand these
   dynamics or have constructive and effective ways of treating the
   symptoms beyond telling you to stay at lower altitudes.

   <p>Supplements from which benefit are more often to be gained include:
     <l>* hawthorn extract (tincture) - heart;
     <l>* Evening primrose oil (detoxer);
     <l>* Hot cayenne in capsule (circulation);
     <l>* Coenzyme Q10 (heart and circulation);
     <l>* Maca herb in capsules (energy and stamina);
     <l>* Gingko Biloba (brain circulation);
     <l>* Quercetin bioflavanoid complex (anti-histaminic).

   <p>Arnica tincture or arnica homeopathic tablets will benefit some
   individuals. As always, check with Spiritual Guidance or by muscle
   testing for personal relevancy. Some personality types will NOT
   benefit from some supplements; some blood types are disadvantaged by
   some supplements.

   <p>Cinnamon has been demonstrated to reduce cholesterol influence with
   almost all persons.

   <p>The use of passive aerobic exercise methods (i.e. The Chi Machine)
   will increase oxygen availability and transport or the cells. If
   living near or above 2000 m and experiencing periodic altitude
   sickness, the use of the Chi Machine can reduce the symptoms. This
   could also assist in reducing the symptoms of poor heart and/or lung
   efficiency, and/or arteriosclerosis at lower altitudes.

   <p>A reduction of the oxygen starvation influence of mercury/lead
   poisoning, fungal and bacterial infections, worm and fluke
   infestations, and, viral attacks -- can also be reduced by the use of
   the Chi Machine. Alternatively, usage of the Chi Machine can be
   restricted by one's Identity elements, energy blocks, and structural
   integration.
