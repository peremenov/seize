   <h>Book Review
   <h>Reaching Out Without Dumbing Down
   <h>by Ken Jung
   

   <p>Whenever my nineteenth-month-old son, William, sees a commercial on
   television he immediately stops what he's doing and gives it his
   undivided attention. Commercials make him concentrate. Commercials
   grab his attention. A quick glance at the table of contents of Marva
   Dawn's work produces the same effect. It grabs your attention.

   <p>In Part Two, for instance, she discusses themes such as "the
   Idolatries of Contemporary Culture" and "Worship as a Subversive Act."
   We can tell that we will not be reading something concocted from the
   evening news or the back pages of the Saturday tabloids. Peering down
   the page further, I observe chapter five, "God as the Center of
   Worship: Who is Worship For?" and six, "The Character of the Believer:
   Having Content or Being Content?" Worship is risky business. My
   personal favorite? How about chapter nine, "Worship Out to Kill Us:
   The Word." Ouch. Like a hot knife cutting through butter, this book
   pierces my heart and leaves me spiritually disorientated, displacing
   my ego, leaving me alone in the wilderness.

   <p>Let me first say that Dawn is not merely writing from the ivory tower
   of academia. True, she has a PhD in Christian ethics and Scripture
   from Notre Dame, but she also is a church musician. Reaching Out
   Without Dumbing Down was not penned by some stuffy, armchair
   theologian. Rather, the thoughts and words have been coined by someone
   who has rolled up her sleeves and has thrown herself into the arena of
   worship. A true gladiator indeed!
   

<h>God is the Subject of Worship

   <p>The most dominant feature is her two-fold recovery of God and the
   nature of worship:

   <p>1. God is the subject of worship.

   <p>2. God is the object of worship. "Since salvation is entirely God's
   gift and not deserved or earned, Christian worship," observes Dawn,
   "above all makes clear who is the giver of that and every other gift,
   and challenges the world to respond to who he is." p.76. In other
   words, God is the subject of worship because he is the sole author of
   our salvation. He is the "Creator, Provider, and Sustainer; Deliverer,
   Redeemer, and Lord; Sanctifier, Inspirer, and Empowerer." p.76. From
   beginning to end the story of redemption provides countless examples
   and details proclaiming God's love in action: saving his people from
   their sins and giving them new life in the Spirit.
   

<h>God is the Object of Worship

   <p>God is the object of worship as well. "Christian worship is about
   offering or sacrifice...The gifts of worship flow from God the
   subject, and return to God as the object of our reverence." P. 80.
   This spiritual truth protects us from any sense of pride and compels
   us to give God all the glory and honor. (The reformers of the 16th
   century proclaimed this same truth: "Sola Dei Gloria!" or to God alone
   be the glory!) "All of us are the actors and all of our worship acts
   are directed toward God. And yet, we must add paradoxically, because
   God is the subject, we always remember that we can only be actors
   because he acted first." p.82. This means nothing less than to treat
   each movement in the worship service- praise, prayer, preaching,
   offering, communion, and any others as acts of worship. Many regard
   the praise element as worship (and it is), but we need to rediscover
   how all the elements work together and help others worship God more
   fully.
  

<h>Worship and Culture

   <p>Worship does not occur in a vacuum and this is one of the stronger
   points of Dawn's book as well. Nobody worships God freely, in the
   sense that we are completely independent from the world. She
   highlights various components of our society...television and how
   television affects our worship of God. While leaning very heavily on
   other writers, possibly too much, she still nevertheless drives her
   points home and they hit the target. Regarding television, she notes:
   "Besides extensively depriving our culture of exposition, television's
   nature also intensifies the appeal to emotions. Its images distort
   watchers' ability to reason and justify choices.... The cultivation of
   the television age has enormous consequences for the Church... Since
   television transforms the method by which people are persuaded by the
   truth, how will we inculcate the truths of faith?" p. 23-24.

   <p>Technology plays a role in shaping our minds as well: "Indeed,
   advances in technology bring us many advantages, but the advantages
   are always coupled with profound losses...primarily the loss of
   community. The computer is a good example... Separated from friends, I
   converse with you from my study...but I cannot hear your input nor see
   your face nor feel your handshake or hug." p. 27.

   <p>As a result, church worship often reflects the cultural milieu that
   surrounds us and becomes more of an entertainment parody rather than a
   service set apart for the proclamation of the Gospel and the glory of
   God. Is there a way out of this mess? Marva Dawn thinks so: "We could
   ask better questions. We could plan worship that keeps God as the
   subject, that nurtures the character of the believer, that forms the
   Christian community to be a people who reach out in God's purposes to
   the world." p. 304.

   <p>Overall, I recommend Marva Dawn's book and would place it in the
   intermediate category for the reading audience. At times, the lengthy
   quotes make you feel like you are reading someone else's opinion; she
   can come across as too cerebral, lacking heart-filled emotions; and
   one of her criticisms is not based on experience (she doesn't own a
   television). Although you may disagree with her points about culture
   and/or a public worship service it is impossible for you to ignore
   her.

   <p>As a result of reading Reaching Out Without Dumbing Down I have begun
   to reform the Sabbath Service in the following areas: communion,
   prayer, offering, and silence. Needless to say, I believe her work is
   worth reading and will impact your view of and how you practice public
   worship.
