   <p>Describe the difficulties of Luria's Z (The man with a shattered
   world)
   and how (to what extent) he overcame them.

   <p>Luria's Z or Zazetsky was once a very clever student studying at a
   Polytechnic Institute in Russia; he was in his fourth year of study.
    However, unfortunately he suffered severe brain damage which
   destroyed
   his chance of a normal life. His brain damage was the cause of a
   bullet fragment shot into his brain during war. From then on Z
   suffered impairment of vision, loss of memory and ability to speak,
   read and write. The book `The man with the shattered world' describes
   how this courageous man relearns to identify, recall and understand
   the
   way to speak, read and write.

   <p>Firstly, Z's ability to see was almost completely ruined. His vision
   worked in very mysterious ways. He could no longer see a whole single
   object. Instead, his eyes saw the left side of objects; the right side
   of things didn't seem to exist. For instance when he picked up a spoon
   he could only see part of it. His vision was not the same as yours or
   mine; it was completely different. To him the things others would see
   would just be a swarm of fuzziness. A picture appeared to be upside
   down, inside out, lop sided and any other way it could be distorted.
   If things did seem to be fuzzy, what he did see was only half as much
   as someone else would see; he had a small span of vision.

   <p>Not only were real situations muffled by his vision but so were
   imaginary situations. Z suffered hallucinations because the damaged
   area of the brain stimulated the nerve cells that retain visual
   memories. It was as though the right side of his body didn't exist.
    He couldn't see it so every time he walked along he bumped into walls
   as a result. Vision was just one of the many difficulties Z suffered.

   <p>Due to the brain damage his `sense of body' changed as well as his
   reactions. In fact, he had no sense of his body including other
   objects
   around him. He loses the sight of his right side because he forgets he
   can't see that side; this is because of t At other times Z was unaware
   of the positioning of his body's parts.
    If he closed his eyes he wasn't quite sure where his right leg was.
    He had to search for parts of his body like separate pieces.
   Surprisingly it was very difficult to show his doctor where his back
   was. In addition he'd forgotten a lot of the names for parts of his
   body; it would take him literally hours to remember. It was impossible
   for Z to point out something quickly because he got all confused. For
   example if the doctor said `Hands on your hips', he would be left all
   bewildered.

   <p>Another misfortune was forgetting how his body functioned like going
   to
   the toilet and forgetting how to get someone's attention. The time
   when he needed the toilet in hospital was frustrating for Z because
   he'd forgotten how to get the nurse's attention. The physical strains
   were just too much for him as he got tired very easily and quickly.

   <p>Sense of space was another difficulty Z faced. Generally, he had no
   sense of it and couldn't judge relationships between things. He
   perceived the world as broken into thousands of separate parts.
   Misjudging the position of objects was one of his faults. For example
   if he wanted to sit down he would misjudge whereabouts the chair was
   and where he was. The same difficulty occurred with clasping hands;
   he couldn't use his right hand because he couldn't see it. This seemed
   to be a situation of `out of sight out of mind'.

   <p>Difficulties such as these ran into those using objects. Z forgot how
   to use simple things. If he was given a needle and thread in hospital
   workshops he would just sit there for ages to workout how to use them.
   They looked familiar but he just forgot how to use them. More
   misjudgments of the position of objects lead to problems. For example
   when he went to axe a stump of wood he would just hit the floor or his
   foot instead. Things seemed so peculiar to him that he was afraid to
   reach out and touch things in his room.
    <p>He lived in a world that seemed to have disintegrated; the simplest
   things became so complex. Z had to search for everything as Luria
   describes,'he mentally probed each object as though he were a
   blindfolded
   man groping his way through space'. It was just one big maze for him
   because because he couldn't orient himself in space, tell from left or
   right or gauge distance and relationship between 2 objects. Z couldn't
   even workout where a sound was coming from because he'd lost spatial
   orientation.

   <p>His ability to read also suffered great problems. It would take him
   hours to read something let alone understand it. Once, his family
   bought a new stove; he spent weeks trying to read and understand the
   instruction booklet that eventually he was convinced the stove was
   faulty. His concentration to read was too hard so he avoided it when
   he could. Generally, he couldn't read; he was illiterate and couldn't
   remember the alphabet. However, he attempted to relearn this skill.
   By the third lesson he could remember the letters m and a but not
   immediately; he progressed very slowly. He especially found it very
   difficult to remember the letters s, k and m. So, he tried to
   associate words with them but he could only remember these for a
   couple
   of minutes. For him to remember words, he found it good to recite the
   out loud. b Reading was very difficult for Z. It wasn't until a few
   months that he knew the whole alphabet; even still he couldn't recall
   it immediately. His visual span was limited so his reading suffered
   subsequently. Z couldn't see an entire word, he had to read each
   letter. In order to read he would have to focus a little to the right
   and above a letter to see it. He could only read three letters at
   a time. Reading was so slow for him ; when he got to the third word of
   a sentence he had forgotten the words before so he'd start again. As a
   result, he read really slowly and became very irritated plus the fact
   that he couldn't read out of his right eye.

   <p>Reading was just part of Z's problem with letters and words. To find
   out he could no longer write was also devastating seeing as he used
   this all the time in his studies. For one the simple task of actually
   holding a pencil was almost impossible. He literally forgotten how to
   do this and write letters. Even if he did manage to write something he
   wasn't in any fit state to read what he'd written.
    The progress of his writing was the same as his progress to read,
   that
   being slow. It took him six months to read and write with intensive
   practice. Z missed out a lot of the important details out when he
   wrote. Punctuation wasn't present in his writing as he'd forgotten any
   kin of rule. Grammar was another impossible obstacle to get over. The
   injury his brain was left with was couldn't allow him to operate with
   language. Too complex syntactical patterns are far too difficult for a
   patient to grasp who can't even grasp the interrelationships of words
   and workout what they imply. For instance, Z may understand what
   `brother' and `father' mean but wouldn't be able to know what
   `brother's father' meant. He was only able to understand very short
   sentences.

   <p>Writing was such a long painful process. He spent twenty five years
   writing his journal. It would literally take one day to write half or
   one full page. This was because he didn't know how to write. He
   didn't know how to link one sentence with another and so consequently
   wrote disjointed phrases and clauses. His lack of memory affected his
   ability to write. It would take him ages to to remember words; every
   word was on the tip of his tongue. The subject he was actually writing
   about also slipped from his memory. As a result he often repeated what
   he'd written because he'd forgotten he'd already written it. Soon, he
   no longer had the strength, memory, thoughts or ideas to carry on
   writing his life story. In fact, writing took longer and longer
   towards
   the end of his journal.

   <p>All of these difficulties Z suffered from were due to major loss of
   memory. In the beginning, just after being wounded, he couldn't even
   remember his own name and the village that he lived in. Names would be
   lingering in his mind ready to be spoken, on the tip of his tongue.
   If he actually tried to to remember things he would find it extremely
   difficult to find the right words. But when he didn't happen to be
   thinking of it he suddenly found words coming to him. For example,
   familiar tunes would suddenly appear in his head. Even so, his memory
   was still very bad. It was also shattered into small pieces like the
   rest of his world.

   <p>As Z's memory was so bad, this prevented him from ever studying
   anything he'd once learnt as a student. His memory even affected him
   in every day situations. It was a constant strain for him to think and
   remember the words people spoke and answer back at the same time. He
   was constantly forgetting. Every day simple chores would be delayed as
   a result of his memory. For instance, he would go to the barn for some
   coal and forget the key; but as soon as he went back for it he'd
   forget
   why he was there. His main trouble was amnesia and forgetfulness.

   <p>Even though his memory was seriously impaired there were some things
   he
   could remember more than others. He found it far easier to remember
   things from far back in the past like his Kindergarten building. The
   funny thing was he had trouble remembering the recent past. As he
   stated ,'my memories came back from the wrong end'. Instead of recent
   situations being easily remember Z could recollect childhood memories
   with a vivid imagination. Whereas simple common memories such as
   remembering what a cat or dog looked like was very hard for Z. He
   couldn't even visualise faces from his own family but he immediately
   recognised them.

   <p>Generally, Z's previous effort to acquire useful knowledge had been
   pointless. Everything he'd learnt at school had gone. Languages he'd
   learnt at school like German and English had been forgotten. As well
   as using foreign languages his use of arithmetic had also gone.
   Unfortunately, Z had forgotten how to count. He was unable to count
   back change given to him in a shop. All those everyday things that you
   or I find simple, he finds complex. He has to look life very simply in
   a way that a young child would.

   <p>Even though Z has tried for years to improve himself, in reality his
   wound has caused major brain damage. Damaged areas of the cerebral
   cortex could not be restored. Improvements haven't really been made
   although he has adjusted to his body peculiarities but they still
   annoy
   him if he's suffering an attack. However, problems with `space'
   continued for years. He was unable to orient himself in his own home
   settlement.

   <p>When it came to reading and writing, he did actually teach himself how
   to do these skills again. However, it took a very long time. As you
   know it took him 25 years to write his journal at one page a day at
   the
   most. The content of his writing didn't really improve as his effort
   to express himself became no simpler. Although, his speaking improved.
   But his world continued to be alien and fragmented. Nothing altered
   his tragic state of memory. So to a certain extent Z never really
   overcame his trouble of memory. Instead he just constantly tried to
   improve things. In reality he was faced with a vicious circle of life
   which had no real end.
