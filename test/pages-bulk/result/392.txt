<h>Commission opposes framework decision on data retention

   

   <p>The European Commission has made it clear to all the Ministers of
   Justice and Home Affairs in the EU that there is no legal basis for a
   framework decision on mandatory data retention in the third pillar.
   The draft framework decision on data retention was introduced in April
   2004 by the governments of France, the UK, Ireland and Sweden in an
   attempt to bypass the Commission, the European Parliament and even
   national parliaments. In the third pillar, the ministers may agree
   unanimously on a decision to harmonise legislation on police and
   justice matters, without any co-decision right for the European
   Parliament and a very limited margin for national parliaments to amend
   such a decision. In the proposal for data retention this margin is
   clearly defined. National parliaments may choose a different timeframe
   for the retention, but only if they review their decision annually and
   report to the Commission why they are still differing.

   <p>The European Commission has issued a press release announcing stronger
   collaboration between anti-spam enforcement authorities in Europe.
   "Anti-spam enforcement authorities in 13 European countries have
   agreed to share information and pursue complaints across borders in a
   pan-European drive to combat spam. They will co-operate in
   investigating complaints about cross-border spam from anywhere within
   the EU, so as to make it easier to identify and prosecute spammers
   anywhere in Europe."

   <p>There are still very few public hotlines in Europe where internet
   users can report spam. These hotlines usually only accept complaints
   about unsolicited e-mail originating in their own country. In that
   light, the promise of closer collaboration between European
   authorities seems a bit futile, if the final recipients of the mail,
   the Internet users, are not involved.

<h>Microsoft excludes free software from EU ruling

   

   <p>The Free Software Foundation Europe says Microsoft is blocking Linux,
   Samba and other major open source projects from taking part in a
   protocol licensing scheme mandated by the European Commission's
   antitrust ruling.

   <p>If developers want to build the protocols into their products, they
   must agree not to distribute that product in source-code form, or to
   subject it to licenses that require source-code disclosure, a formula
   that excludes many open source licenses.

   <p>The European Commission gave Microsoft a record fine of 497 million
   euro after a five-year investigation by the Competition Commissioner
   into Microsoft's business practice. The Commission ordered Microsoft
   to offer a version of Windows without a bundled media player and to
   share more technical information with server rivals.

<h>EP committee wants new software patents proposal

   

   <p>On 2 February 2005 the legal affairs committee of the European
   Parliament (JURI) voted with an overwhelming majority (19-2) to get
   rid of the current software patent proposal and start all over again
   with a new proposal. Only 1 MEP voted against the initiative, and 1
   MEP was absent.

   <p>The former French prime minister Michel Rocard gave an impressive
   speech in the JURI committee. With all respect for the new
   Commissioner for the internal market, Charlie McCreevy, he said he and
   other MEPs felt "mustard was coming through their noses". A first
   'inelegance' Rocard noted was the fact that all the EP amendments in
   the first reading of the proposal had been ignored by Commission and
   Council. Secondly, the ministers of Germany and The Netherlands had
   ignored their own parliaments. Thirdly Rocard opposed the repeated
   attempts to adopt the proposal in the wrong forum of ministers, twice
   even at a Fishery Council. Rocard concluded his speech by explaining
   once more why the word 'technical' in the Council proposal couldn't
   help anybody distinguish between what is patentable and what is not.

<h>Rapporteur demands co-decision data retention

   

   <p>The rapporteur from the European Parliament on telecommunication data
   retention, Alexander Alvaro, has presented his first views on the
   draft framework decision in a turbulent meeting from the Committee on
   Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE). Alvaro proposed on 1
   February 2005 to split the proposal in two, and give the European
   Parliament full co-decision power on the decision where it affects the
   internal market, on the costs and the exact list of data. Currently,
   the European Parliament only has a 'consultation' right on this issue.
   It cannot veto or amend the proposed decision, since it is considered
   third pillar legislation (police and judicial cooperation in criminal
   matters). Only the ministers from the EU member states can decide
   about these matters, if they reach unanimity. Alvaro doubts whether
   the proposal can ever meet the demands of proportionality when it
   comes to the Internet. He finds the proposal lacks proportionality, is
   in possible violation of the assumption of innocence, and contrary to
   the spirit of Article 15 of the E-Privacy Directive of 2002, which
   only allows for specific and temporary legal measures by member
   states, not for a harmonising decision. Concluding, he demanded a
   maximum term of 6 months, a limitation to data already processed by
   companies for business purposes and rules for general cost
   reimbursement.

<h>EU consultation calls for social impact studies on nanotech


   <p>The European Commission puts nanotechnology high on the political
   agendawith its Communication 'Towards a European strategy for
   nanotechnology'.The communication has been discussed at the political
   level in theEuropean Council under the Irish and Dutch presidencies
   during the year2004, and an on-line open consultation on the
   communication was heldbetween August and October 2004 by Nanoforum,
   the EU sponsored thematicnetwork on nanotechnology. The Nanoforum
   received some 750 responses tothe consultation. Half of the
   respondents came from the researchcommunity.

   <p>The consultation concludes that nanotechnology will have a strong
   impacton European industry and its citizens within only ten years from
   now.Nanotechnology will have its strongest impact on chemistry and
   materials,

<h>Data Retention: Parliament Rapporteur doubts legal foundation

   

   <p>The European Parliament's rapporteur on the retention of traffic
   dataresulting from all kinds of electronic communications, Alexander
   Alvaro(Liberal, Germany) has asked the Parliament's legal service to
   look intothe legal foundation for this report. His doubts are founded
   on the factthat the report contains obligations addressed to civil
   parties, which isa strong indication that it ought to be in
   co-decision. As Mr. Alvaro toldEDRI-gram, he proposes to split the
   draft into two separate reports. Thefirst part would contain the
   law-enforcement side of data retention andremain in the consultation
   procedure. The other part, dealing with theindustry's obligations,
   would have to be in the co-decision procedure. Mr.Alvaro also
   considers going to the European Court of Justice to get a

<h>Poland blocks software patents once more

   

   <p>Poland did it again. For the second time they blocked the attempt
   tosilently adopt EU Council's agreement on software patents, this time
   inthe Fisheries Council of 24 January 2005. The government of Poland
   hadalready requested the item to be deleted from the agenda of
   theAgriculture and Fisheries Council on 21 December 2004.

   <p>On the Friday preceding the Fishery minister's meeting the Polish
   EuropeanCommittee of the Council of Ministers, presumedly acting on
   the initiativeof the country's Ministry for Science and Technology,
   requested not toinclude the Directive on the Patentability of
   computer-implementedinventions on the agenda of that Council meeting,
   because "the work on thefinal position of Poland on the issue has not
   yet been completed". Astatement published on the Polish Office of the
   Committee for European

<h>EU plans database of visa applicants' biometrics

   

   <p>The EU Commission plans to store biometric data taken from visa
   applicants in the planned Visa Information System (VIS). This was
   decided as part of a proposed regulation, which was already due in
   late 2004, but was delayed until 7 January 2005. The delay seems to be
   due to technical problems with stacking multiple RFIDs on documents.
   The upcoming Luxembourg Presidency of the Council wrote a note on
   these technical difficulties on 22 December 2004.

   <p>The note mentions in particular collision problems arising when
   several RFID tags would be included in one passport. As a possible
   solution concerning visas, the note proposes to store the biometric
   data only in the VIS and not on an RFID sticker, and says a majority
   of EU member states delegations seems to be in favour of this second
   solution. Concerning residence permits, the Luxembourg Presidency
   proposes to issue separate cards, with the biometric data on an RFID
   chip, as is currently planned also for EU citizens' travel documents.
   This solution is, however, opposed by Germany, where residence permits
   are already being issued in the form of stickers.

<h>Commission approves contracts for international data transfers

   

   <p>The European Commission has approved of a new set of standard
   contractual clauses for international data transfers proposed by seven
   international business associations. The contracts are said to offer
   an adequate level of data protection under the EU's data protection
   laws. Companies can use the clauses to provide a legal basis for
   transfers to data controllers outside of Europe as from 1 April 2005.
   The new clauses will be added to those already available under the
   Commission's June 2001 decision (IP/01/851).

   <p>Companies believe that some of the new clauses, such as those on
   litigation, allocation of responsibilities or auditing requirements,
   are more business-friendly. According to the Commission the new
   clauses provide for a similar level of data protection as those of
   2001 and prevent abuses, the data protection authorities are given
   more powers to intervene and impose sanctions where necessary. The
   implementation of this new set of clauses will be reviewed in 2008.
