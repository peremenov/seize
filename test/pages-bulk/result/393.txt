                               <h>Water Control

   <p>Operation manuals  for the control structures and the recommended
   water management are available with the Ministry of Public Works.
   Areas are grouped in Water Management Zones. For each Water Management
   Zone in a Scheme there is a detailed description for operation
   depending on the crops grown, their growth stage and a number of
   physical  characteristics. 
    

   <p>Factors having an influence on the soil and water management: 
   <p> Plowing. Plowing of the rootzone followed by sun-drying up
   to two weeks of the clods improves the effect of the following
   leaching and puddling of the soil. Together with the puddling, the
   Plowing is the most efficient way to leach out the toxic elements from
   the root-zone.
   <p> Puddling (with pump irrigation). Leaching and Puddling will
   require pump irrigation to make the soil sufficiently wet. Puddly and
   soft wet soil is a requisite to the growth of rice up to the end of
   the tillering stage. When the soil is puddly and soft there are
   relatively wide spaces between the soil particles, there is a low
   percentage of the solid phase and both bulk density and hardness are
   low. These conditions favour rice plant growth and absorption of
   nutrients. After a number of years, with repeated cycles of puddling,
   the formed plow-layer will encourage much better water control.
    <p>Sun-drying (mid-season). Drainage of the rice field between
   the end of the tillering stage and the panicle differentiation stage
   will lead to higher yields. Rice roots will extend more deeply and
   stems grow more strongly. Drainage will increase the portion of the
   most active white roots of the rice plant and will decrease the number
   of non-active black roots. This drainage will also cause the soil to
   become more hard and compact by sun drying. According Cheng (1984) the
   presence of white roots against black roots is a good indicator that
   sufficient drainage has been applied.
   <p> Leaching/percolation. The main aim for the water management
   is to promote leaching/percolation by controlled drainage during
   periods with rainfall. It will be difficult to provide sufficient
   water for 8 mm/day percolation. It appears that leaching is most
   essential during planting and early growth of the transplanted rice.
   Pump irrigation during this period should be highly recommended for
   real high yields. Water supply may include acid canal water as it has
   little effect on the yield and can be used to provide sufficient
   percolation.
   <p> Water levels up to 30 cm below land surface during the
   growth period of rice in areas no pump irrigation will be applied.
   Water levels are preferred to drop up to 30 cm below surface in very
   acid soils which has not be puddled and leached by extra pump
   irrigation. These water level below surface does not affect the yields
   in these rice fields of the swamp lands. During periods with high
   rainfall mostly the groundwater levels will be higher. The groundwater
   level should not drop below 30 cm below land level. The groundwater
   levels drop up to 30 cm below surface will not be necessary anymore in
   soils subject to several cycles of plowing, leaching and puddling with
   pump irrigation.
   <p> Ripe soils. Ripe soils are in advantage over less-ripened,
   soft soils for high yields. These soils can also be  better puddled
   and are less subject to toxic conditions. Ripe soils in the swamplands
   will be formed after long periods of dryness during the dry season.
   <p> Groundwater drop below 60 cm during dry season. A long dry
   period in the dry season when groundwater levels drop below 60 cm
   depth will have a very positive effect on the next crop.The positive
   effect is attributed to better aeration of the soil, oxidation of
   toxic organic compounds and increased permeability by crack forming in
   the poorly drained clay soils. In wet years the drop of groundwater
   will hardly occur during the dry season. Therefore an field drainage
   system is required. For the Acid Sulphate soils it is essential that
   sufficient percolation can be applied after the dry season, during the
   next growing season. In these conditions the El Ni√±o effect of 1997/98
   resulted in peak high yields for the following growing season in the
   Telang project of South Sumatra province.The same positive effect in
   acid sulphate soils has been recorded for the Saleh project (South
   Sumatra) in 1994/95, also after an extreme long dry season. Computer
   Model Simulations based on acid sulphate soil oxidation and leaching,
   also show that a deep drop of groundwater below the pyrite layer does
   not influence the toxicity in the next growing season, when normal
   percolation quantities (4-8 mm/day) are applied during the growing
   season of the rice.
   <p> Flushing and avoiding slackwater conditions. From an
   environmental point of view it is necessary to avoid acid conditions
   in the canals. Potentials for fisheries will increase with better
   quality water. Better quality water can be obtained by avoiding the
   slackwater conditions in canals. It is a matter of Design  to improve
   water movements in the Primary and Secondary canals.

  <p> Without mechanised land preparation including pump irrigation during
   land preparation and early planting of the rice crop there will be no
   high yields possible!

 <p>  So what are the main (most important) objectives of the soil & water
   management system? 
   <p> Controlled drainage. During most of the time in the wet
   season:  Groundwater levels should not exceeding 30 cm below land
   surface. During the dry season groundwater levels should be at about
   60 cm below surface for most of the time.
   <p> Flushing of canal water and avoiding slackwater conditions.
   Double connected canals and one-way flow in the main canals in areas
   far away from the river. (2-3 km and more)
     _________________________________________________________________

  <h> Gate operation:

  <p> Objectives for soil/water management are fulfilled by the operation of
   the control gates. A gate usually consist of a sliding gate and
   stoplogs. Four types of operation are defined for the Tidal Swamp
   Schemes: Retention, Controlled Drainage, Supply and Maximum Drainage.
   Of these operations the Controlled Drainage is the most important
   operation which will be functioning for most of the time in Indonesia.


  


  <p> The operation of the gates has been practiced and monitored in the
   Model areas. It proves that the most difficult operation is water
   supply, because it requires frequent visits to the gates and careful
   watch of the tides for a good result. For that reason water supply
   operation should be preferable carried out near the home-stead's. (SPD
   secondary canal). Controlled drainage is the most easy operation and
   should be preferable carried out on the other side (SDU secondary
   canal). See Design Macro.

  <p> A description of the operation guidelines is given in WebPage Model
   Area.
