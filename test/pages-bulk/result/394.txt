   <p>Renewable energy sources, including wind power, are increasingly seen
   as a way of meeting the Nation's energy requirements while also
   contributing to carbon emissions reductions, promoting fossil fuel
   conservation, and reducing other harmful pollutants such as sulfur
   dioxide and nitrogen oxide. However, renewables can also be more
   expensive, and by their nature some are not always available to meet
   baseload electricity demands. This paper describes the methodology
   used in the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) for representing
   electricity generation from wind power, one of the more mature and
   lower cost renewable energy technologies, and one that has been
   prominently mentioned as a means of helping to meet the Kyoto
   Protocol's carbon reduction targets for the United States.

                               <h> Introduction

  <p> Existing wind power capacity in the United States today is
   approximately 2,000 megawatts--about 0.2 percent of all U.S.
   grid-connected electricity generating capacity--and accounts for about
   0.1 percent of generation.^1 As a carbon-free technology, however,
   wind power is increasingly discussed for its potential in meeting U.S.
   and global carbon reduction targets, such as those proposed in the
   1998 Kyoto accords. Wind technology does not have fuel requirements as
   do coal, gas, and petroleum generating technologies; however, both the
   equipment costs and the costs of accommodating special characteristics
   such as intermittence, resource variability, competing demands for
   land use, and transmission and distribution availability can add to
   the costs of generating electricity from wind.

 <p>  The purpose of this paper is to describe how the Energy Information
   Administration (EIA) addresses in the National Energy Modeling System
   (NEMS) the natural resource, transmission and distribution, and market
   factors that affect the cost of U.S. electricity generation from wind
   resources. This introduction summarizes general electricity modeling
   in NEMS. The second section, "Representing Wind Generating
   Technology," outlines the overall NEMS representation of wind,
   including identification of the cost adjustment factors. The third and
   fourth sections, "Basis for Wind Cost Adjustment Factors" and "Cost
   Adjustment Factors for U.S. Wind Supply, "provide EIA's justification
   for and derivation of the cost adjustment factors. The sections show
   applications of the factors in recent EIA forecasts for wind power,
   identify key issues for further examination, and conclude by
   summarizing the importance of the issue of cost.

  <p> NEMS is an integrated computer model of the U.S. energy economy. It
   includes modules representing all the major supply and demand sectors
   that produce and consume energy. Within NEMS, the selection of new
   generating capacity, including wind, is based on the relative costs of
   competing technologies. Electricity generating technologies compete
   based on capital, fuel, and operations and maintenance (O&M) costs for
   providing U.S. regional baseload, intermediate, and peaking electric
   power supply. Intermittent technologies such as wind also compete on
   their ability to meet electricity demand at the time winds are
   available.

  <p> Capital costs for all generating technologies are affected by a number
   of characteristics. Using information from the Department of Energy,
   the Electric Power Research Institute, published reports, meetings
   with industry and technology representatives, and others, EIA
   estimates the initial capital cost for each technology.^2 Capital
   costs decrease as experience with the technology increases
   (learning-by-doing effects), and as domestic and international
   capacity penetrate electric power markets.^3
   At high rates of growth, however, capital costs may temporarily
   increase in response to short-term bottlenecks.

  <p> Fuel costs also affect technology competition. For fossil fuels, fuel
   costs are projected separately in NEMS in the individual fuel supply
   modules, providing inputs for subsequent choices among generating
   technologies. In contrast, the availability and cost of wind energy--
   essentially its "fuel" cost--are represented in two ways. First, wind
   turbine capacity factors used in NEMS vary by geographic region, time
   of day and season, and by the estimated energy content of available
   winds (wind class). Second, experience indicates that the energy
   availability of wind turbines is also affected by other factors in
   addition to region, time, and wind class. EIA expresses these
   additional factors along with others by adjusting wind technology
   capital costs. The derivation of the adjustments is the primary focus
   of this paper.

                  <h>Representing Wind Generating Technology

  <p> The methodology for projecting electricity generation from wind power
   consists of a series of data inputs, capacity and dispatch algorithms,
   and specific components for characterizing wind energy supply. Each is
   discussed below.

  <h> Data Inputs

  <p> The primary data inputs are existing wind generating capacity, future
   capacity planned by electricity producers, wind technology cost and
   performance characteristics, wind capacity factors, and cost
   adjustment factors. EIA collects information on existing capacity and
   that planned for the future from electric utilities and nonutilities,
   including independent power producers and small power producers.
   Planned capacity commitments include capacity under construction,
   under contract, mandated by law or regulation, or under commitment by
   an electricity producer.

  <p> Mandated new wind capacity in Minnesota and Iowa, as well as estimates
   of new wind capacity to be installed under State renewable portfolio
   standards, are included as planned capacity. In 1999, for example,
   more than 600 megawatts of new wind generating capacity are planned,
   scheduled to take advantage of the Federal renewable energy production
   incentive before its expiration on July 1, 1999. Proposals or goals
   for new capacity that have not yet resulted in firm commitments are
   not included as "planned."

  <p> Capital costs for new generating technologies are assumed to decline
   as more units enter service and experience increases. EIA derives
   estimates for the key cost and performance values for wind power from
   a variety of sources, including the Electric Power Research Institute,
   the Department of Energy, other industry participants, and current
   market data.^4

   <h>Capacity and Dispatch Methodologies

  <p> In order to meet projected growth in the demand for electricity and to
   replace retiring generating units, new capacity is added over and
   above existing and known plans for new capacity. The essential steps
   in the methodology are to determine future capacity needs based on
   peak demands, subtract current (net of retirements) capacity from
   those needs, and project the types of capacity that must be built to
   reach the target. The technology choice is based primarily on total
   costs over a 30-year horizon, including capital, O&M, and fuel costs.
   Technology choice is also affected by subsidies and taxes, such as
   those associated with meeting environmental requirements. Intermittent
   technologies-- mainly wind and solar--are special cases, because they
   are not always available and thus have a reduced ability to meet
   demands. This problem is resolved by segmenting annual electricity
   demand into a number of "slices," defined by season and time of day.
   Wind and solar compete directly for new capacity to serve those parts
   of the load for which they are most suited, and they are not penalized
   by considering overall annual demands only, for which they would be
   too expensive. However, because they are not always available, their
   credited contribution to meet the peak demand is reduced, because
   their inclusion reduces the overall reliability of the system. The
   impact of this reduction is that more fossil-fuel-fired capacity may
   be built to meet the reliability requirements when wind is chosen as
   the most economical technology.

   <p>Unlike fossil fuel technologies that can be dispatched at varying
   capacity factors depending on demand and marginal cost, wind power is
   dispatched in NEMS at specified capacity factors derived by EIA and
   differing by hour of the day, season, region, and wind class. Wind
   capacity factors are based in part on the performance of actual units
   and in part on the maximum performance suggested by research on
   characteristics of new technologies. In addition, some improvement in
   wind capacity factors over time is assumed as new capacity is used and
   electricity producers learn how to operate their units more
   efficiently.

  <h> Wind Energy Characterization

  <p> Wind energy is the "fuel" for wind technologies. Because wind's fuel
   value is partly incorporated in capital costs and is not separately
   priced, EIA modifies capital costs for wind projects on the basis of
   three key characteristics: wind class, costs of building new
   transmission interconnection with the existing transmission and
   distribution network, and cost adjustment factors. The cost adjustment
   factors account for variations in natural resource quality, costs of
   upgrading the existing network, and effects of alternative uses for
   lands with wind resources. For wind resources to be useful for
   electricity generation, the site must (1) have sufficiently powerful
   winds, (2) be located near existing transmission networks, and (3) be
   economically accessible considering additional natural resource,
   transmission network, and market factors.

  <p> Wind technology opportunities are first identified by regional
   estimates of available wind energy. The foundation of EIA's wind
   supply characterizations is the adaptation of standard wind supply
   maps provided by the Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL).^5 The PNL
   wind data are first expressed in square kilometers of land, shown by
   electricity market region and by wind energy class. Wind energy values
   are grouped among seven wind-speed classes, with higher numbers
   indicating greater energy resources (Table 1). The few class 7 wind
   resources are included with class 6 (designated in Table 1 as "6+"),
   and winds below class 4 are generally regarded as not economically
   useful. Recognizing that some lands will not be made available for
   wind power use, EIA has adopted PNL's "moderate" wind resource
   exclusion scenario (Table 2).^6 Applying these criteria, EIA
   determines U.S. wind resources by region (Table 3).

  <p> Table 1. Wind Classes for Wind Energy Characterization

  <p> Table 2. Percentages of Lands Excluded from Wind Energy
   Characterization in the Pacific Northwest Laboratory Moderate
   Exclusion Scenario

  <p>Table 3. U.S. Wind Resources for Electricity Generation, by Wind Class
   and NEMS Region

  <p> As shown in Table 3, the United States has ample wind resources.
   Figure 1 shows the potential U.S. wind supply for wind power stations
   at different capital costs (excluding learning effects, improving
   capacity factors, and cost adjustment factors).^7 Although wind
   technologies are not comparable to baseload or other generating
   capacity, total U.S. wind resources equal about three times total U.S.
   generating capacity and could produce roughly twice the nation's
   current electric power generation, if costs were not an issue.^8
   However, U.S. wind resources are heavily concentrated in a few regions
   (the NEMS electricity regions are shown in Figure 2). Nearly 60
   percent of all U.S. wind resources are in the MAPP region, and no
   economically useful wind resources are recorded in FL and MAIN.
   Further, nearly 90 percent of U.S. wind resources are in the least
   valuable class, class 4. Thus, while plentiful overall, the best U.S.
   wind resources are not necessarily near either population
   concentrations or electricity demand centers.

  <p> Figure 1. U.S. Wind Supply 

  <p> Figure 2. Electricity Market Model Regions 

  <p> The second step in the characterization limits usable wind energy
   resources to those sufficiently close to existing 115- to 230-kilovolt
   transmission lines. They fall within three distance zones (Table 4).
   All new generating capacity, regardless of technology type, has an
   associated standard transmission interconnection fee, which varies by
   region but averages about $225 per kilowatt. This fee represents the
   average cost of building a new line interconnecting the new generating
   plant with the existing network. In addition, extra costs averaging $5
   per kilowatt per additional mile are added to account for the greater
   distance of wind sites from existing transmission networks (Table 4).

  <p> Table 4. Distance Zones, Miles From Wind Resources to Existing
   Transmission Lines

  <p> Finally, composite cost adjustment factors (Table 5) account for
   expected additional costs confronting actual U.S. wind development.
   All new wind generating capacity in every region is subject to one of
   five capital cost adjustment factors (steps). Capacity in the
   least-cost steps (steps 1 and 2) corresponds to the definition of
   economically accessible energy reserves. Capacity in steps 1 through 4
   encompasses technically accessible resources (at current prices). All
   capacity (steps 1 through 5) encompasses the total wind resource
   base.^9

  <p> Table 5. U.S. Wind Resources by Region and Cost Adjustment Factor

  <p> The cost adjustment factors reapportion each region's total wind
   resources shown in Table 3. They allow an initial portion of regional
   wind resources to be built at no increase in capital costs, with
   increasing proportions constructed at capital cost increases of 20,
   50, 100, and 200 percent above the base cost.^10 In the NWP region,
   for example, 7.7 gigawatts of wind resources are available at the base
   cost (itself affected by overall learning, capacity factor change,
   etc.), an additional 13.2 gigawatts are available at 20 percent above
   base cost, 8.6 gigawatts at 50 percent above, and 1.5 gigawatts at
   double the base cost. All remaining resources of the PNL allocation
   for NWP (275.2 gigawatts) are relegated to the most expensive step,
   step 5, with a 200-percent cost increase.

  <p> Learning-by-doing also affects wind technology capital costs. A
   region's resulting wind technology capital cost depends both on the
   overall nationwide increase in wind capacity, which lowers capital
   costs through learning-by-doing effects, and on the proportion of the
   region's wind resources already used, which increases costs of further
   penetration.

  <p> Cost adjustment factors are superimposed on the existing regional
   totals shown in Table 3. As a result, the cost-increasing effects of
   the cost adjustment factors are not evenly distributed within wind
   classes, but first apply to class 6 wind resources until either the
   resource or the weighted proportion is exhausted. Extending the NWP
   example, the subtotal of all 31 gigawatts of wind resources for the
   region, shown in steps 1-4 of Table 5, are obtained from the 70.3
   gigawatts of class 6+ resources shown in Table 3.

 <p>  The effect of the cost adjustment factors is to redistribute available
   U.S. wind supplies. Figure 3 shows the redistribution at the National
   level. Figure 4--at a much reduced scale--shows the redistribution for
   the Northwest (NWP).^11 Clearly the effect of reallocation is to
   markedly reduce the quantities of wind available at all but the
   highest costs. Whereas wind supplies under class 6 designation alone
   (Table 3) offer nearly 102 gigawatts of least-cost wind supply, the
   effect of imposing cost adjustment factors is that only 28 gigawatts
   are in the least-cost step and 41 gigawatts in the next, together
   equaling only two-thirds of the best wind resources in the PNL-based
   allocation.

  <h> Evidence From Experience

  <p> Separate from issues of turbine manufacturing cost, the supposition of
   plentiful U.S. wind supplies suggests relatively trouble-free siting
   of wind plants in the early years of commercial wind power
   development. However, actual U.S. plants proposed or entering service
   in the 1990s are confronting significant additional project costs,
   suggesting that unencumbered U.S. wind resources are not necessarily
   as plentiful as characterized in general cost estimates.^12

  <p> First, natural phenomena can impose additional costs on new wind
   sites. Too strong or off-peak winds, storms, freezing, lightning,
   hail, vegetation, erosion, bird and animal habitat requirements, or
   other natural characteristics raise costs, reduce output, or reduce
   wind's market value. New wind plants in Minnesota, Iowa, Vermont, and
   Wyoming require reinforcement to cope with winter storms and heating
   equipment to remove ice, which degrades performance and forces
   occasional shutdowns. Texas wind plants confront additional costs--
   both in original installation and in unanticipated replacements and
   repairs--from violent wind storms, tornadoes, hail, and lightning. In
   the West and Midwest, late winter and spring peak winds miss the
   summer electricity peaking demands. In the Northwest, winds tend to be
   unpredictable. Terrain slope and variation also raise costs and
   preclude developing large portions of otherwise attractive new wind
   sites in Minnesota and Wyoming. Steep, heavily vegetated, and
   difficult terrain eliminate many parts of New England and Northwest
   lands because of both higher installation costs for turbines, lines,
   roads, etc., and higher maintenance costs. Finally, coping with
   insects, birds, and local animals can raise costs or preclude current
   use of otherwise attractive wind areas. Insects coat Midwestern wind
   turbine blades, degrading performance and necessitating more frequent
   blade cleaning, thereby reducing output while increasing costs.
   Lessons learned from bird kills in 1980s California projects has
   accelerated 1990s avoidance of less expensive lattice towers, addition
   of special coatings and markings on turbines, measures to discourage
   nesting, and in some cases, avoidance of attractive windy areas used
   by migrating birds.

  <p> Second, although EIA accounts for costs of interconnecting new wind
   plants to the existing transmission network, the already loaded
   network is often unable to accommodate additional wind resources in
   important wind areas, thereby raising costs and reducing least-cost
   wind development opportunities. Northern States Power, ostensibly
   awash in wind resources relatively near transmission lines (Table 3),
   finds the existing in-state transmission network loaded and unable to
   accommodate more than 425 megawatts of wind capacity from the
   supposedly ample Buffalo Ridge wind area.^13 New wind projects in
   Wyoming and in Oregon faced significant cost hurdles in upgrades and
   power transmission charges. Major expansion of western wind power
   requires significant upgrades over a very long transmission corridor,
   and plentiful West Texas and panhandle winds face additional costs for
   wheeling power to major electric power markets in central Texas.

  <p> Finally, additional market preferences for alternative land use
   increase wind project costs and preclude otherwise excellent wind
   power projects, such as in Columbia Hills and Rattlesnake Hills
   (Washington), Burlington (Vermont), and Cape Cod (Massachusetts). In
   the West and Northwest, environmental, scenic, cultural, and religious
   values effectively restrict or preclude wind power development.
   Protection of birds, of Native American cultural and religious values,
   and of scenic vistas plays prominently in the elimination of seemingly
   excellent wind sites.

  <p> Lack of detailed information precludes separate representation of each
   additional cost in NEMS. However, observation of their effects on new
   U.S. wind plants-- along with noticeably higher than expected capital
   costs--leads EIA to conclude that the additional factors need to be
   represented in the wind cost methodology. Literature reviews and
   contacts with industry professionals show that every large wind
   facility installed in the United States in the 1990s has been subject
   to at least some of the forces underlying the factors. Moreover,
   whereas EPRI-DOE estimates indicate that actual installed costs for
   new wind plants should average below $900 per kilowatt by 1999, costs
   for recent large installations appear to exceed $1,200 per kilowatt.
   For example, the 34-megawatt Big Spring project in Texas, reported at
   $40 million, averages $1,176 per kilowatt; a reported $235 million for
   the 193-megawatt wind facility at Alta, Iowa, yields an average cost
   of $1,220 per kilowatt; two new Northern Alternative Energy projects
   at Buffalo Ridge in Minnesota totaling 23.1 megawatts and $32 million
   average $1,380 per kilowatt; and the $60 million 41.4-megawatt Foote
   Creek Project in Wyoming yields a cost of $1,450 per kilowatt.^14
   While these values may include some components not usually included in
   overnight capital cost definitions, EIA is not aware of any recent
   wind project completed at less than $1,000 per kilowatt.

  <h> Evidence From Regional Supply Evaluations

  <p> Three specific regional wind resource reviews--in Minnesota,
   California, and by the Northwest Power Planning Council
   (NWPPC)--indicate that economically accessible wind resources are less
   plentiful than indicated by wind speed and distance from transmission
   networks alone. The studies range from qualitative (Minnesota) to
   quantitative (California) to fairly detailed (NWPPC).

  <p> In 1996, Minnesota's "Appel Report" to the Minnesota Legislative
   Electric Task Force concluded with respect to wind resource areas that
   ". . . massive development of wind and biomass generation systems in
   Minnesota will require additions to the transmission system . . .
   [because] much of the renewable resource area lacks transmission
   capability . . . ."^15 The Appel Report-- along with Northern States
   Power`s difficulty in siting more than 425 megawatts--is the basis for
   sharply restricting least-cost wind supplies in MAPP and other
   similarly well-endowed wind resource regions.

  <p> The 1991 California Energy Commission (CEC) report, Technical
   Potential of Alternative Technologies, provides some quantitative
   information, essentially providing a technical upper bound of
   "reasonable" wind potential for that State.^16 While acknowledging a
   much larger PNL estimate of 37,000 megawatts as "gross technical
   potential," the CEC assessment of individual sites concludes that a
   reasonable technical potential for California is 4,460 megawatts under
   existing transmission constraints.^17 Loosening the transmission
   constraints somewhat increases the total technical potential to 5,385
   megawatts.^18 In either case, the CEC estimates stand in sharp
   contrast to the 20.1 gigawatts shown in Table 3.

  <p> The 1996 NWPPC study, Northwest Power in Transition, provides one
   fairly detailed study relating wind technology costs and
   quantities.^19 The NWPPC study covers only the states of Idaho,
   Montana, Oregon, and Washington. Nevertheless, it provides a useful
   exposition of the general shape of a likely wind supply function.
   Figure 4 includes a representation of the NWPPC values (converted by
   EIA to capital costs), with NWPPC wind generating capacities doubled
   to account for the larger NWP region represented in NEMS.

  <p> The NWPPC wind supply function identifies 10,700 megawatts of
   potential wind power available in the four States at a range of costs
   below 20 cents per kilowatthour. Further, the report acknowledges that
   private developers have likely identified other cost-effective sites,
   and that still other sites probably exist, though they are likely
   small and best suited for local loads.

 <p>  The NWPPC supply also illustrates limits to accessibility for wind
   power. Of the total 10,700 megawatts, NWPPC estimates that less than
   2,000 megawatts could be developed at 6 cents per kilowatthour or less
   (1995 dollars) in the absence of a new transmission intertie to
   Montana. Moreover, the low costs would be achieved only if enough wind
   development occurred to distribute the high fixed costs of the
   necessary transmission upgrades. (Because of typically low capacity
   factors for wind projects, the cost of amortizing an increment of new
   transmission capacity is assigned to far fewer kilowatthours for a
   wind project than for typical fossil-fueled projects, again raising
   costs for wind-generated power.) Finally, although transmission
   remains the most important limiting factor, site viability is also
   limited by wind characteristics, topography, weather, environmental
   and habitat concerns, and land use conflicts.

  <p> The Minnesota, CEC, and NWPPC studies provide useful information for
   U.S. wind supply estimation. First, they begin to recognize economic
   constraints on some of the most important wind resources in the
   Nation. Second, they both quantify opportunities and identify general
   reasons for limitations in accessing wind resources. As such, they
   form a valuable base for EIA's representation of U.S. wind power. The
   three assessments have limitations, however, for wider application.
   The NWPPC study characterizes only part of the NEMS NWP region.
   Moreover, California and the Northwest--featuring great distances,
   large mountains, forests, and significant scenic, cultural, and
   environmental challenges--may not be representative of important
   Midwestern and Southwestern wind regions for which detailed
   information is not available.

              <h>  Cost Adjustment Factors for U.S. Wind Supply

  <p> The five cost adjustment factors are broad applications of rates of
   cost increase and proportions of wind supplies derived from the
   Minnesota, CEC, and NWPPC wind resource information. In general, EIA
   makes the following assumptions:
     <p>* Regional estimates developed by EIA will not exceed estimates made
       by authoritative studies prepared by individual regions.
       Therefore, the CEC and NWPPC results set upper bounds on
       quantities and costs of economically accessible wind resources for
       those regions. EIA relaxes this assumption somewhat in the
       Northwest, to accommodate both NWPPC acknowledgment of additional
       "undiscovered" resources and adjustments for the larger NEMS
       region.

     <p>* There are fewer economically accessible winds (reserves) than
       technically accessible ones. The U.S. Department of Energy
       indicates that less than 1 percent of all technically accessible
       wind resources are economically accessible reserves, although
       technologies have improved since those estimates were made.^20 EIA
       takes into account that published wind resource estimates already
       exclude some land for economic reasons and assumes a much less
       severe reduction.

     <p>* Least-cost wind resources in every region are assumed to be
       sufficient to meet future wind capacity requirements in the EIA
       reference case.

     <p>* Wind resource distributions for small regions (those with fewer
       wind resources) are assumed to resemble the CEC distribution; wind
       distributions in large regions are assumed to resemble the
       distribution of the NWPPC study.

   <p>Examining Table 3 or Table 5 shows two broad regional groups, "small"
   wind regions with relatively few wind resources (less than 25,000
   megawatts) and "large" wind regions with extensive wind resources
   (more than 175,000 megawatts). Given that CNV falls in the "small"
   category and NWP in the "large," EIA first established distributions
   for CNV and NWP and then broadly applied those distributions to other
   regions. As a result, ECAR, MAAC, NY, NE, and STV follow the CNV
   example, while MAPP, SPP, and RA follow the NWP distribution. Because
   its winds are considered generally accessible, ERCOT is treated as a
   special case of a small wind region, with higher proportions of its
   winds in lower cost categories.

  <p> EIA employs five discrete cost steps. Steps 1 and 2 represent two cost
   levels for wind reserves, either economically accessible now or in the
   very near future. Reserves plus higher cost steps 3 and 4 yield
   technically accessible resources, those which could reasonably become
   reserves by 2020. Step 5 represents that part of wind resources which
   EIA does not consider economically accessible by 2020 under any normal
   circumstances. The technical potential of 4,460 megawatts set by CEC,
   for example, becomes the control total for steps 1 through 4 in the
   EIA distribution.

   <p>EIA derives steps 2, 3, and 4 from two sources. First, to be useful,
   each of the cost steps needs to show meaningful cost increases;
   therefore, EIA chose each step to clearly differentiate major cost
   classes. Second, particularly for the initial steps, EIA very broadly
   applied cost breaks exhibited in the NWPPC supply. Finally, EIA chose
   the 200-percent increase (step 5) to separate resources determined
   extraordinarily unlikely to be economically accessible. All PNL wind
   resources in California and the Northwest in excess of the NWPPC and
   CEC estimates (as adjusted by EIA) are assigned the 200-percent
   increase; similar proportions are then applied to the PNL estimates
   for other regions.

   <h>Small Regions: Adapting CEC Information to ECAR, MAAC, NY, NE, and
   SERC

   <p>Using the CEC total as an approximate upper bound for California's
   technically accessible resources, EIA assigns 4,522 megawatts as the
   total of steps 1-4 and the remaining 15,585 megawatts to step 5. Of
   the 4, 522 megawatts, 1,710 megawatts representing already installed
   wind generating capacity are assigned to step 1 (reserves). In order
   to provide opportunities for least-cost growth and expansion in the
   other cost categories--but with no information available for the
   distribution--EIA allocates the remaining 2,812 megawatts equally
   across the 4 technically accessible resource steps. In effect, the CEC
   allocation places about 10 percent of wind resources in the lowest
   cost step and about 80 percent in step 5.

   <p>Other "small" wind resource regions are similar but not identical to
   CNV. The CNV allocation is unusual because of the large already-built
   component and the independently determined CEC bound. Therefore, for
   other small regions, a slightly lower proportion of total wind
   resources is assigned to step 1 and higher proportions are assigned to
   steps 2-4. Further, recognizing that U.S. Department of Energy and
   other energy resource characterizations show increasing resource
   proportions at higher costs, EIA generally increases the wind resource
   proportions for small regions as costs increase.^21 Finally, for all
   small regions except CNV, EIA increases the four lower cost step
   shares to offset the use of average rather than marginal costs (see
   below).

  <h> Large Regions: Adapting the NWPPC Estimates

  <p> Before applying the NWPPC results to other regions, EIA first adapts
   them to the larger NWP geographic region and then adjusts them to
   reflect the use of average cost steps rather than a continuous cost
   function. First, EIA doubled the NWPPC wind supply estimate for each
   supply step. The NWP region in NEMS is roughly twice the geographic
   size of the NWPPC region (Figure 2). Although the additional States in
   NWP (Nevada, Utah, and the western half of Wyoming) are less well
   endowed with wind resources than the NWPPC region, nevertheless, the
   NWPPC believes its region also contains additional undiscovered wind
   resources not included in its published wind supply. Therefore, to
   avoid underestimating total wind resources in the NWP region, EIA
   doubled the NWPPC wind supply estimates--from over 10,000 megawatts to
   nearly 21,000 megawatts--as an estimate of all economically accessible
   wind in NWP steps 1-4.

  <p> Second, for both small and large wind resource regions, EIA increases
   the lower cost supplies to offset consequences of employing average
   costs in the defined steps. A drawback of step functions employing
   average costs is to overstate the marginal costs of the first units
   within each range. Overstating marginal costs for new technologies
   could have the effect of preventing initial purchases and thereby
   precluding the entire path of investment, learning, lower costs, and
   additional investment. To compensate for such overpricing, EIA
   reallocates portions of capacity from higher cost steps to lower cost
   ones, including some supply from step 5 into step 4, and thereby
   increases total wind supply in steps 1-4 to nearly 31,000 megawatts.

  <p> The effect of both EIA adjustments to NWPPC wind resources is to
   greatly increase lower cost wind supplies in NWP relative to the NWPPC
   estimates. Whereas NWPPC has less than 2,000 megawatts of least-cost
   wind supplies (including some winds in the Blackfoot Wind Resource
   area), EIA assigns 7,653 megawatts to step 1 for the NWP region.
   Whereas the NWPPC estimates yield less than 11,000 megawatts for all
   NWPPC wind resources, EIA includes nearly 21,000 megawatts for NWP
   reserves and nearly 31,000 megawatts for all NWP technically
   accessible resources in steps 1-4.

  <p> The NWPPC allocation is applied to the wind-rich MAPP, SPP, and RA
   regions, although steps 2-4 are assigned increasing quantities at
   higher costs to reflect the normal shape of supply functions. Step 1
   is also reduced to reflect the scale of limitations on transmission
   access demonstrated by the Northern States Power experience at Buffalo
   Ridge. In effect, the NWPPC allocation places less than 3 percent of
   wind resources in the lowest cost step and more than 80 percent in
   step 5.

  <h> The ERCOT Special Case

  <p> ERCOT, covering major portions of Texas, is handled separately. The
   electrically integrated ERCOT region excludes most of the excellent
   winds in the western and panhandle areas of Texas. As a result, ERCOT
   becomes a small wind resource region, with less than 10,000 megawatts
   of wind resources in total. On the other hand, both ERCOT terrain and
   market conditions appear excellent for wind development. Therefore,
   EIA has assigned ERCOT a unique wind supply function offering moderate
   wind volumes at low costs (15 percent in step 1) and growing shares at
   intermediate higher costs, but with only 7 percent in the highest cost
   step 5.

                              <h>Wind Projections

  <p> Recent EIA forecasts illustrate application of the wind cost
   adjustment factors. Table 6 shows EIA projections for U.S. wind
   generating capacity in 2020, by region, from the reference and high
   renewables cases of the Annual Energy Outlook 1999 (AEO99) and in a
   case taken from Impacts of the Kyoto Protocol on U.S. Energy Markets
   and Economic Activity (Kyoto Protocol).^22

  <p> Table 6. U.S. Regional Wind Generating Capacity in Various Cases, 2020

  <p> The cost adjustment factors have no effect on wind generating capacity
   builds in the reference case in AEO99. In most regions, wind capacity
   though 2020 remains well below the limits of step 1, the first level
   of reserves, especially in regions where wind development is most
   likely (the Midwest, most of the West, and Texas). California, also a
   likely wind development area, approaches first-step reserves limits by
   2020.

  <p> The AEO99 high renewables case, in which EIA assumes that renewable
   energy technologies have lower costs than in the reference case,
   illustrates the effect of the cost adjustment factors on wind
   penetration.^23 In this case the cost adjustment factors appear to
   have no effect on most regions, including the Midwest, Northwest, and
   ERCOT. However, in California (CNV) and in RA, wind capacity is
   projected to be built despite the 20 percent higher costs imposed by
   the cost adjustment factors. In California wind capacity growth stops
   at the end of defined reserves (step 2), indicating that the higher
   costs assumed for step 3 prevent additional wind capacity growth in
   the CNV region.

   <p>The Kyoto Protocol 1990-7% case, in which electricity producers choose
   large volumes of biomass and wind renewables in order to meet major
   U.S. carbon reduction requirements, can be seen as an "extreme" case.
   Results of the case show that the cost adjustment factors can have
   important effects in cases of high demand for renewables, both
   limiting wind power development and also contributing to higher
   electricity prices. Results suggest that very large increases in
   demand for wind power could exhaust economically accessible wind
   resources in some regions. Despite the technology cost reductions from
   expansion of wind power nationwide, resource constraints in some
   regions (ECAR, MAAC, and STV) result in installed wind costs
   approaching $1,800 per kilowatt by 2020. In California, all
   technically accessible resources (steps 1-4) are used and some step 5
   resources are selected. In most regions, all least-cost reserves are
   exhausted. Nevertheless, even in this very demanding case, regions
   with large wind resources appear capable of complying without large
   cost increases. For such regions, the net result of learning effects
   and cost adjustment factors is to lower wind power costs.

           <h>  Issues in EIA Wind Capital Cost Adjustment Factors

  <p> Given the limited information available, EIA's wind capital cost
   adjustment factors appear to yield plausible portrayals of increased
   costs with very large increases in wind power demand. However, they
   also have important limitations, particularly when analyses involve
   major growth of wind power. Although EIA is confident that installed
   costs increase as wind resources are consumed, there is considerable
   uncertainty about the rate of cost increases, the extent of cost
   increases, and interregional differences in wind technology costs. The
   most serious issue affecting the wind capital cost adjustment factors
   is the lack of basic data about the magnitude of wind technology cost
   change as wind resources are used. Lack of basic cost information
   challenges every stage of wind capacity forecasting, including both
   reference case projections with relatively small capacity increases
   and cases of high renewable energy demand. Much more information is
   needed on the components of wind technology cost increases,
   distinguishing natural resource issues from transmission and
   distribution and from market issues. Features and costs of
   transmission and distribution networks, for example, may be
   particularly important and may be usefully distinguishable from other
   forces.

  <p> Wind resource estimates for ERCOT and California are particularly
   problematic, especially because these regions are significant
   participants in wind energy markets. The challenge with ERCOT is in
   determining whether its vast wind supplies are really available in
   large quantities at constant costs, or whether and at what points
   limiting factors--such as transmission and distribution--exist. The
   challenge in California is in reconciling CEC resource estimates with
   amounts of already developed capacity, while retaining opportunities
   for additional wind power growth. EIA is working with analysts in both
   regions to determine improved factors.

  <p> EIA's current approach superimposes the cost adjustment factors onto
   the existing wind class and distance methodology in NEMS. In effect,
   EIA assumes that the best and closest winds are also those exempt from
   or least affected by natural resource, transmission access, and market
   forces. The higher costs are assigned to lower class, more distant,
   and less likely selected wind regimes. For example, in California, all
   4.5 gigawatts in steps 1-4 (Table 5) are from the State's class 6 wind
   resource base (Table 3). In reality, the factors undoubtedly affect
   all wind classes at all distances. The result of this practice is to
   understate the costs of developing some portions of U.S. wind
   resources. EIA is considering measures to ameliorate these effects.

                                <h> Conclusion

  <p> The issue of wind power opportunity is likely to become increasingly
   important in determining future U.S. electricity supply. Understanding
   wind prospects is important in expected "normal" energy futures as
   well as for possible exceptional ones. As wind turbine costs decline
   and their performance improves, the extent to which wind resources,
   transmission and distribution networks, and market forces complement
   or offset these improvements becomes all the more pertinent for near
   and mid-term electricity supply. If these additional factors have
   little influence, then improved wind technologies may enjoy fairly
   rapid penetration in normal U.S. electricity markets. To the extent
   that economically accessible wind resources are soon exhausted,
   networks are full, or markets are resistant, however, wind power may
   find itself still a marginal source of electric power supply.

  <p> Understanding actual wind prospects becomes all the more important in
   assessing proposed changes in national policy that could dramatically
   increase the demand for wind power. Relatively generous wind resource
   supplies could make policy choices that favor renewable energy
   technologies more attractive and less costly. Restricted wind resource
   supplies, in contrast, could portend much higher electricity prices,
   greater demands and impacts on consumers, and greater impacts on
   overall U.S. economic growth.

  <p> EIA's use of wind cost adjustment factors formally recognizes the
   existence and importance of additional forces specific to wind
   technology in assessing U.S. wind energy supplies. Moreover, they
   appear to account in rough fashion for the scale of effects of such
   factors on U.S. wind power cost. Nevertheless, the importance of wind
   resource effects on overall U.S. electricity supply highlights the
   need for improved information about them.
