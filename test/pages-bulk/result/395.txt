   <h>Robert Burns Lives!
     _________________________________________________________________

           <h> Edited by Frank R. Shaw, FSA Scot, Atlanta, GA, USA

   <p>One of the great pleasures of editing Robert Burns Lives! is the
   opportunity to meet people throughout the global Scottish community
   who love Robert Burns. In this issue, you will hear from Peter
   Westwood, Castle Douglas, Scotland, the distinguished Editor of the
   Burns Chronicle and author of several books. Peter has taken time from
   finishing a new set of books on Burns to furnish this article for our
   readers. It is extremely rare that an author working on his or her
   next book will stop to provide an article for Robert Burns Lives!  In
   the next issue, David Smith, Hon. Secretary of the Burns Howf Club,
   will present our guest column. The Howf Club is located in the
   building that houses The Globe Inn that was frequented by Burns. David
   has been Hon. Secretary of the Club for 30 years! Gladly do we sit at
   the feet of these men to learn more about Robert Burns. I deeply
   appreciate the contributions they make to this column that now
   receives as many emails as the book reviews or the "Chats" with
   authors.

<h>Robert Burns - Country Dancer
<h>By Peter J. Westwood, Editor, Burns Chronicle

                           

   <p>Over the years many questions have been asked about the social life of
   Scotland's National Bard, Robert Burns. It is a well-known fact that
   he was socially popular even as a teenager and country dancing was
   early on his list of social activities to the extent that he defied
   the wishes of his father by joining a local country dancing class.  In
   his autobiographical letter to Dr. Moore, he stated: "In my 17^th
   year, to give my manners a brush, I went to a country dancing school.
   My father had an unaccountable antipathy against these meetings; and
   my doing was, what to this hour I spent, in absolute defiance of his
   commands."

               <p>His brother Gilbert was later to say, "Robert excelled in
   dancing, and was for some time distractedly fond of it".  It was at a
   dance during April 1785 that Burns first met Jean Armour who was
   eventually to become his wife.

              <p> Many stories have been repeated over the years about what
   the Poet may or may not have said or been responsible for. One story
   on the subject of dancing which originated from one of the Poet's
   schoolmates, William Niven, goes as follows:

              <p> A week before a local fair, Robert suggested to his friend
   William that they should organise a dance on the evening prior to the
   fair, and hold it in one of the public houses in the village and
   invite their girlfriends to come along.  William consented and it was
   agreed that some other young men should be asked to join in on this
   undertaking.

              <p> The dance took place as planned, music being supplied by a
   hired band (probably a local fiddler) and a dozen couples took part.
   At the close of the dance they found that the cost of running the
   evening amounted to eighteen shillings and fourpence.  Unfortunately,
   hardly any of those attending had any money, except William, who
   possessed about two shillings and sixpence.  However the problem was
   eventually solved when William agreed to find the money to pay for the
   dance. He did this by selling stationery to the school which he
   acquired from his father's warehouse in Maybole. He also sold pens and
   paper to his friends. It is not known whether or not these items were
   acquired officially!

                              

              <p> Words associated with the many forms of dancing and
   singing crop up from time to time, not only in the many songs and
   poems of Robert Burns, but also in his correspondence, particularly in
   his letters to James Johnston (Scots Musical Museum) and to George
   Thomson (Select Scottish Airs).

               <p>More than anyone else Burns was responsible for the
   survival of hundreds of Scottish tunes including those used for
   dancing, many of them still in vogue today. Verses from the Poet's
   tale, "Tam o'Shanter" and his song "The Deil's awa wi th' Exciseman"
   provide excellent examples on the theme of dancing.

                    <p> "Warlocks and witches in a dance:
                  <p> Nae Cotillion, brent new frae France,
               <p> But hornpipes, jigs, strathspeys, and reels,
                  <p>  Put life and mettle in their heels."

            <p> "There's threesome reels, there's foursome reels,
                <p> There's hornpipes and strathspeys, man,
                <p> But the ae best dance e'er cam to the land
                  <p> Was the Deil's awa wi th' Exciseman".

               <p>The Poet's love of dancing was largely due to his fondness
   of the lasses and this can be seen in a number of his songs.  In his
   "Bonnie Jean" he remarks:

              <p> "He gaed wi Jeanie to the Tryste (Cattle-Fair)
                    <p>  He danc'd wi Jeanie on the down,
                   <p>  And, lang ere witless Jeanie wist,
                 <p>Her heart was tint, her peace was stown!"

              <p> The subject of the song was not his wife Jean, but Jean
   McMurdo, daughter of the Chamberlain of Drumlanrig Castle.  In his
   "Fragment on Maria" he pays compliment to Maria Riddell, who could
   possibly have been a dancing partner:

                  <p> "How gracefully Maria leads the dance!
                  <p> She's life itself; I never saw a foot
                  <p>  So nimble and so elegant.  It speaks
                  <p>And the sweet whispering Poetry it makes
                        <p>   Shames the musician."

               <p>During the Poet's tour of the Highlands in 1787 he met
   Niel Gow, the famous fiddler, equally well known in Scots song and
   dance. The Poet's song "Amang the Trees" was intended as a compliment
   to Niel:

                    <p>"Amang the trees, where humming bees
                  <p>  At buds and flowers were hinging, O,
                   <p>   Auld Caledon drew out her drone,
                   <p>   And to her pipe was singing, O.
                 <p>`Twas pibroch, sang, strathspeys and reels
                 <p>    She dirl'd them aff fu clearly, O,
                <p>  When there cam a yell o freign squeels,
                   <p>   That dang her tapsalteerie, O!"

               <p>My final quotation comes appropriately from "The
   Ploughman" which is a typical example of Burn's reworking of a
   traditional song:

                   <p>  "I hae been east, I hae been west,
                 <p>  I hae been at Saint Johnston, (Perth)
                  <p>   The boniest sight that er'e I saw
                  <p>   Was th' ploughman laddie dancin'.
                  <p>    Snaw-white stockins on his legs,
                  <p>      And siller buckles glancing;
                  <p>    A gude blue bonnet on his head,
                  <p>      And O but he was handsome!"

              <p> Let George Thomson have the final words:

              <p> "Mr. Burns, whose enthusiasm for Caledonian Music and
   Song, was only equaled by his poetical talents, no sooner heard of the
   Editor's plan, than he signified his warm approbation of it, and in
   the most liberal and cordial manner undertook to contribute every aid
   in his power for rendering the Collection as complete as possible. He
   has performed what he promised in a manner that transcends the
   sanguine expectations formed by the Editor, having enriched the Work
   with the most exquisite Songs, both Scottish and English, that exist
   in any language; they exhibit all the charms of the Poet's genius in
   the utmost variety both of serious and humorous composition; and every
   intelligent reader will contemplate his luxuriant fancy, his ardent
   feeling, and manly sentiment, and the impressive energy and simplicity
   of his style, with equal wonder and delight. All his tender and
   impassioned Songs breathe the genuine, glowing, unaffected language of
   the heart; while the scenes, the manners, the innocence, and the
   pleasures of rural life, are portrayed with a pencil so true to
   nature, as to engage our warmest sympathies and admiration."
