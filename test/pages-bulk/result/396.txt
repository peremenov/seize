                        <h> Issue #113 - January 2005

  <h> Introduction

  <p> The start of a new year is traditionally a time to try new things, and
   those of you who follow the Emerald City blog will have noticed that
   it has a rather different look to it than the rest of the site. I
   spent the holidays playing with software techniques such as CSS, XML
   and PHP. I am painfully aware that technically speaking the Emerald
   City site is still somewhere in the Dark Ages. The new look of the
   blog is a first step in moving it away from that embarrassing state.

  <p> This will take time. There are real problems with compatibility in web
   programming, and the flagrant disregard for supposed agreed standards
   by Internet Explorer is just flabbergasting. I dont want to release
   stuff and then have people not able to view the site. But at the same
   time a little programming is going to make it much easier to maintain
   and use.

  <p> The other real problem I have is that my skills in graphic design are
   so far off the scale at the negative end that it isnt funny. Theres
   not much I can do about this. Ive never had any artistic talent. If
   anyone wants to offer suggestions I would be very grateful.

  <p> Meanwhile, back with New Year traditions, this issue sees my review of
   the year in SF&F. It has been a very good one, I think. Heres hoping
   that 2005 is even better.

  <h> In this issue

  

  <h> Best of 2004

  <p> Id like to start by drawing a distinction between my Best of the Year
   List and my Hugo nominees. The Hugos have specific rules that allow
   books to be eligible more than once, depending on how they were
   published. Consequently two of my favorite books of all time, Light
   and The Course of the Heart, both by M. John Harrison, are
   Hugo-eligible this year. That rather constrains my nominations.
   (Though I am, of course, delighted for Harrison and very much hope
   that he gets on the ballot.)

  <p> Emerald City, on the other hand, attempts to cover the
   English-speaking world. And therefore I try to limit my Best of the
   Year selections to books that are getting their first English
   publication in the year in question. So, M. John Harrison books aside,
   here we go on the best of 2004. Within categories books are listed in
   alphabetical order by title.
          ________________________________________________________

  <h> Science Fiction

  <p> Air Geoff Rymans wonderful tale about how we humans adjust to
   information technology is one of those books I thought would probably
   be too good to get the recognition it deserves. Really clever and
   subtle books often leave many readers going "doh?" and the more
   cynical ones saying, "this isnt commercial enough." Plus being about
   the inhabitants of a small village in Central Asia is not likely to
   endear the book to a mass market. So Im delighted to see Rymans book
   on the Philip K. Dick Award short list.

  <p> Banner of Souls Liz Williams keeps being on the brink of writing an
   utterly brilliant novel. This one came very close. It certainly boasts
   the most lyrical and atmospheric prose we have seen from her to date.
   Heres hoping that she keeps on getting better. Williams is a regular
   feature on the Philip K. Dick Award short list, and this book is no
   exception.

  <p> City of Pearl Karen Travisss debut novel was quite outstanding. It is
   a fairly fast paced and very political piece of SF that is both in the
   thick of the genre and fresh and interesting at the same time. Another
   Philip K. Dick Award nominee.

  <p> Cloud Atlas I dont think than an SF book has ever been the hot
   favorite to win the Booker Prize before, and it may be several
   millennia before one is again. If it happens again in our lifetime,
   David Mitchell will be the man to achieve that honor. Hes the darling
   of the mainstream literature set, but at the same time you tell from
   reading Cloud Atlas that he is familiar with SF classics and is pretty
   competent at writing SF. Im really looking forward to his next book.

  <p> Iron Sunrise Charlie Stross is about as hot as it gets in the SF world
   right now. His cutting-edge cyber-driven space operas are quite
   possibly incomprehensible to anyone without a background in SF and
   computers, but if you know what Stross is talking about then you
   quickly become in awe of his command of the jargon. All of the crazy,
   far-future technology he makes up sounds utterly plausible.

  <p> Newtons Wake Ken MacLeod does comedy. Really he does. And what is more
   he manages to do comedy about politics. The scene where his heroine
   steps through a wormhole, falls onto a beach, and looks up to find a
   statue of Karl Marx towering over her will stay with me for a very
   long time. This being MacLeod, there is a lot of serious speculation
   about economics and politics in Newtons Wake, but it is a hugely
   entertaining book as well.

  <p> River of Gods Ian MacDonald has never been afraid to do something
   different with his novels. But taking on the task of writing the
   quintessential Indian SF novel is probably the bravest thing he has
   done yet. AIs and nanotech explode across a landscape imbued with
   Hinduism, regional rivalries, caste politics and some interesting
   speculations about gender, or rather lack of it. Besides, how can I
   not love an SF novel that features a cricket match?

  <p> Stamping Butterflies North Africa still runs strongly through Jon
   Courtenay Grimwoods fiction, but his latest novel is worlds away from
   El Iskandria. Although parts of the book are firmly rooted in Morocco,
   other sections drift dreamily through a massive, artificial world
   light years away and centuries into the future. The strands are
   connected through the political decisions of a present-day US present.
   Truly, the flapping of a butterflys wings can cause a storm on the far
   side of the galaxy.

 <p>  The Fourth Circle If there is one book in this list that is going to
   get panned as un-commercial by most reviewers, this is it. Zoran
   ivkovic pulls no punches in this delightfully strange and experimental
   story. And somehow it still manages to sound wonderful even after
   having been translated into English from Serbian.

  <p> White Devils Move over Michael Crichton and Margaret Atwood, this is
   how a real science fiction writer does a biotech disaster thriller.
   Sure the book has a bunch of cartoon thriller villains, sure lots of
   people die in inventively nasty ways. Thats what thrillers are all
   about. But along the way Paul McAuley manages a much more
   sophisticated and adult approach to both the science and the politics
   than Crichton or Atwood seem capable of managing.
          ________________________________________________________

  <h> Fantasy

  <p> Iron Council I still have my reservations about the central third of
   China Miévilles latest Bas-Lag story, but there is no doubting the
   continued fabulous inventiveness of his writing and world creation. It
   was also a delight to see Miéville introduce an actual political
   revolution to New Crobuzon and not have it turn out happily ever
   after. As for the way in which he elevated Torro from being a
   memorable character walk-on from Perdido Street Station to a central
   part of Iron Council, well, love it!

  <p> in the night room mainstream reviewers have been talking endlessly
   about the cleverness of the structure of David Mitchells Cloud Atlas.
   They should also take a look at Peter Straubs wonderful new novel that
   mixes up writers and characters until the reader is hard-pressed to
   tell the difference. A lot of horror fiction is so bad and formulaic
   that even us SF folks look down on it with disdain, but Peter Straub
   is an author who can hold his own in any company.

 <p>  Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell I dont think that Susanna Clarkes debut
   novel conquered the world in quite the way that Bloomsbury expected it
   to, but it certainly made a very big splash. It was also highly
   entertaining for most of its 800 or so pages, and this from someone
   who loathes Jane Austen. I guess it must have been the footnotes. Or
   the portrayal of Faerie. Or the Raven King. Or the brilliantly
   obnoxious Yorkshireness of Gilbert Norrell. England hasnt read so well
   in a long time.

  <p> Mortal Love In the interview I did with Elizabeth Hand for Strange
   Horizons she talks about the edginess that a writer obtains by setting
   fantasy novels in the present day. Anyone can make magic believable in
   a pseudo-medieval, cookie-cutter fantasy world. It isnt hard to make
   it believable in the 18^th Century. But to make people believe that
   magic happens in present day Camden Town, without the aid of any
   chemical supplements at all, is not only very difficult but profoundly
   disturbing as well. Elizabeth Hand can really make us believe that the
   world we know can be turned upside down in an instant, and that our
   lives will never be the same again.

  <p> Olympic Games OK, so it was kind of cheesy for Leslie What to release
   a novel about Greek Gods in New York in a year in which the Olympics
   returned to Athens. But hey, everything else about the book was
   wonderfully inventive, not to mention very funny. Zeus and Hera are
   the archetypes of the sex war, and What used them to their full
   potential, while managing to have some very real human characters as
   well. A very promising debut.

  <p> Perfect Circle Ah, class. With this book Sean Stewart has produced a
   perfect little ghost story. Several of the books in this list were
   published by small presses, but this is the only one of them where I
   was absolutely amazed that no major publisher had picked it up. The
   mainstream press should be raving about this book.

  <p> Shadowmarch Im a little disappointed that such a traditional fantasy
   book should follow the brilliant War of the Flowers, but having been
   part of the Shadowmarch online community for several years I well know
   that Shadowmarch the book was written first. Besides, traditional
   fantasy is something that Tad Williams does very well indeed. There is
   a huge market for it, and if people are going to buy books with elves
   and dwarves in them (or at least near facsimiles thereof) then I want
   them to be buying Tad Williams because nobody does it better.

  <p> The Last Light of the Sun I try very hard to fit as many newly
   released books into each issue of Emerald City as I can. That means I
   have little or no time to catch up on books I should have read years
   ago. Which is frustrating, because sat on my bookshelves are several
   unread Guy Gavriel Kay books. I know that they will be very good. His
   Sarantium series was excellent, and his latest book is even better.
   Besides, how can I not love a book with such wonderfully Welsh
   characters in it?

  <p> The Wizard Knight Everyone agrees that Gene Wolfe is a genius. Many
   reviewers, however, dont quite know what to make of The Wizard Knight,
   because it appears to be less obscure and puzzle-filled than the
   New-Long-Short Sun series, but at the same time is more opaque. Just
   what is Wolfe getting at? Why the Norse gods, when Wolfe makes it
   clear that a single creator God exists above them and an archangel
   makes an appearance in the book? Well, because Wolfe is talking about
   layers of power and responsibility. Wolfe is making a case for the
   world being more than the stark Protestant division of Us and God, of
   Saved and Not-Saved. We all have free will, and we need to learn to
   use it responsibly.

  <p> The Year of Our War Wow, three debut novels in the fantasy top ten.
   The world is indeed turned upside down. And perhaps nowhere more so
   than in Steph Swainstons wonderfully imagined The Year of Our War. Any
   book will contain echoes of other works that the author has read and
   admired, but I dont think I have read anything else quite as strange
   and unusual as Swainstons book all year. I do hope that she can keep
   up this level of creativity.
          ________________________________________________________

  <h> Collections and Anthologies

  <p> All Star Zeppelin Adventure Stories This anthology was a little
   patchy, but nearly all of the stories were really good fun. Zeppelins
   are cool what can I say?

   <p>A New Universal History of Infamy Rhys Hughes at his bizarre and
   hilarious best. Do you need another excuse to laugh at Margaret
   Thatcher? Of course you do.

  <p> Novelties & Souvenirs I dont spend enough time reading John Crowley. I
   should do, it would be good for me. There are some wonderful stories
   in this book. Is it New Wave Fabulism? Who cares, just read it.

   <p>Secret Life I guess that compared to City of Saints and Madmen this
   collection of more or less conventional and largely unconnected
   stories by Jeff Vandermeer will seem quite ordinary. But it isnt.
   There are many very good stories indeed in this collection. Highly
   recommended.

  <p> So Long Been Dreaming Another patchy anthology, mainly because too
   many of the authors let their anger or desire to make political points
   run away with their stories. But there are some very good stories in
   there as well, in particular Vandana Singhs excellent "Delhi".

 <p>  Stagestruck Vampires Suzy McKee Charnas does vampires as only she can.
   Plus some very interesting background on the Motherlines series.

  <p> Stable Strategies Eileen Gunn takes a very long time to write stories,
   but seems to come out with good ones whenever she does. Tachyon padded
   a little to get a book out of them, but it is well worth a look.

  <p> The Atrocity Archives So you didnt know that the British government
   has a special spy network specifically dedicated to protecting the
   country from slimy, tentacled monsters from beyond the stars?
   Thankfully Charlie Stross did.

  <p> And look, every single one of these books comes from a small press
   publisher.
          ________________________________________________________

  <h> Short Fiction

  <p> Quite a few very good books of novella length, or just within the
   stretch limits of novella length according to the Hugo rules, have
   been published in 2004. I confess that I am much more likely to read
   and enjoy such things than short stories.

  <p> Not Before Sundown Johanna Sinisalos wonderful tale of a photographer
   finding a baby troll in his yard deserves a place on everyones
   bookshelf.

  <p> The Healthy Dead Steven Erikson might be the king of big, fat fantasy
   novels in the UK, but it is the novellas he writes for PS publishing
   that I love best. They are seriously funny.

  <p> The Labyrinth Quite the most startling book of 2004, though possibly
   way too poetic for everyones taste, is Catherynne M. Valentes
   wonderful tale inspired by Greek myths.

  <p> Viator Some of the things that Lucius Shepard does to create books are
   quite mad, but they always result in something wonderful. Viator also
   has the benefit that writing very long sentences is much less
   dangerous to Luciuss precious existence than living amongst Hobos on
   the railroad.

  <p> "tourism" OK, I have to have some short stories, and how could I
   ignore the little tale from the Light universe that M. John Harrison
   produced for Amazon.

  <p> "The Annals of Eelin-Ok" I suspect that the anthology this story comes
   from will join my list as soon as I get to read it, but in the
   meantime I continue to marvel at the brilliance of Jeffrey Ford.
          ________________________________________________________

  <h> Other Stuff

  <p> There are a few other things that I want to mention about 2004 that
   were particularly good.

  <p> A Serious Life This "biography" of one of the UKs oldest and most
   notorious small presses was my non-fiction find of 2004.

  <p> Lyda Morehouse doesnt quite get into my SF top 10 on the strength of
   Apocalypse Array alone, but I loved the series of which it formed the
   final volume.

  <p> Being there to witness Bibliomancy winning Best Collection at the
   World Fantasy Awards was definitely a highlight of my year.

   <p>The Concrete Castle Gig I got to see Billy Bragg in concert, from a
   distance of about 3 feet. Magic.

 <p>  And of course Winning a Hugo

   

  <h> Suffer a Witch

  <p> The new Graham Joyce novel, The Limits of Enchantment, is to some
   extent a follow-on from The Facts of Life. In that book there is
   mention of how, in the middle of the 20^th Century, professional
   midwives with years of experience but no professional qualifications
   were being hounded out of work by the new, official, government health
   service. In modern, technological Britain, old witch women were no
   longer to be allowed to practice their arts. Especially when those
   arts also included abortion advice. It was, after all, well known that
   young women who became pregnant outside wedlock were mentally
   disturbed and should be put in asylums, not given abortions.

  <p> So, enter old Mammy Cullen, resident wise woman of a small village
   near Leicester. Mammy has successfully delivered well over 100 babies,
   including some that looked quite dead on their arrival into this
   world. The women of the village mostly think she is wonderful. The men
   regard her with some suspicion but are cautious because it is known
   that whenever a girl comes to Mammy to get an abortion part of the
   price is the name of the man responsible. Mammy cant write, but she
   has a very good memory.

  <p> The local authorities have already outlawed amateur midwifery. If
   Mammy is caught helping deliver a baby then she can be put in jail.
   But she doesnt mind over much. She is old, and will doubtless not be
   long for this world. It is her adopted daughter, Fern, that is the
   problem. Fern certainly has the talent to be a good midwife. She has
   assisted at many births. And she has Sight. But she doesnt altogether
   believe in the Old Ways. Her main interest in the Moon is that
   President Kennedy said he was going to send men there, not in its
   magical powers. Ah well, at least she isnt going stupid over
   mop-topped pop stars and wearing mini skirts like the rest of the
   village girls.
          ________________________________________________________

  <p> I stared hard at these words on my notepad and I couldnt see any extra
   value in them. Any at all. Vertex presentation? We say: head first. I
   counted the syllables. Thats three times as long to say the same
   thing. Why had I come to college to learn words that added no more
   than a lot of extra noise to the sum of my knowledge?
          ________________________________________________________

  <p> Unfortunately Mammy waits too long. An unfortunate incident in the
   village leaves her in hospital, an institution dominated by her
   enemies: doctors and freemasons. It is a prison from which Mammy will
   not escape. Fern is left to cope on her own. Her only allies are her
   worldly friend, Judith, the hippies who live on the farm up the road,
   and a village lad called Arthur whose main interest in Fern appears to
   be getting her into bed.

  <p> Compared to The Facts of Life, The Limits of Enchantment is a much
   less edgy book. It is hard to beat the Second World War for dramatic
   horror. But The Limits of Enchantment is rather more angry. There are
   times which it descends into situation comedy, which is very British
   of it, but for much of its length it rails against the injustice
   imposed on well-meaning, ordinary people by those in authority: the
   nobility, the medical establishment, social workers, the police and so
   on. In many ways it is a book that is just as applicable today, except
   you could use gays instead of independent women and Blacks or Muslims
   in place of pagans and hippies.
          ________________________________________________________

 <p>  The hare told me that we had moved into the time of Man and that was
   not a good thing, even for men and women. It complained bitterly of
   the leverets killed in the blades of combine harvesters. It asked me
   if I knew how many combine harvesters there were in the country, and
   when I shook my head it specified an exact figure. The corn bleeds, it
   said pointedly, we bleed.
          ________________________________________________________

  <p> Gollancz clearly think a lot of this book. My review copy has the now
   famous Isabelle Allende blurb for The Facts of Life on the cover. On
   the back cover it proudly says, "The Limits of Enchantment will be
   submitted for the Booker Prize." And you know I think it might get
   somewhere. To start with Graham Joyce is a wonderful author and this
   is a very readable and entertaining book. Also it doesnt read like a
   fantasy. Most of the "magic" that happens can be rationalized if you
   work hard enough at it and are pig-headed enough to not want any of it
   to be "true".

 <p>  But it is fantasy nonetheless. Like The Lord of the Rings it is an
   elegy for a lost time in which life was simpler and closer to nature
   than it is now. Unlike The Lord of the Rings, Joyce accepts that time
   moves on, and that magic can be found in other ways and in other
   places. Fern does not fade and go into the West. She picks herself up,
   adapts, and gets on with doing what needs to be done. In her own way
   she will become part of the nascent Feminist movement. And when she is
   old like Mammy she will doubtless shake her head at Grrl Power and
   wonder what the youth of today is coming to. But along the way the
   Moon will have traveled with her, for all that it has been trampled on
   by male feet. And while much of the Green and Pleasant Land has been
   overrun by the pressures of over-population, there are still places
   where the hares box in the dawn light of March. The Goddess is not
   dead yet, and Graham Joyce is doing his bit to keep Her memory alive.

 <h>  Music of the Spheres

  <p> So, the Revelation Space series is ended, and Al Reynolds has to come
   up with a new setting for a story. What, we might well ask, will he
   do?

  <p> Wendell Floyd is an American in Paris. He is in Paris because he has
   been told that it is the best place in the world to make it as a jazz
   musician. Paris does, after all, have that café culture. The French
   seem to like American jazz musicians. Unfortunately for Floyd, he isnt
   a very good jazz musician, so he has to have a day job. Which is where
   the private investigator gig comes in. Only right now Floyd seems to
   be making more money as a poor jazz musician than as an OK private
   eye. What he needs is a nice, mysterious murder to solve.

   <p>So, Century Rain is a hard-boiled detective novel.

  <p> Of course, one of the problems with being a private detective in Paris
   in 1959 is that the authorities are getting a little full of
   themselves. Adolf Hitler might be languishing in jail after the
   botched invasion of 1940 and subsequent coup in Germany, but that
   doesnt mean that Fascism is dead. Indeed, the French seem to be rather
   taking to the idea. Which makes the position of any independent
   investigator especially a foreign independent investigator who happens
   to play decadent Negro music rather precarious.

  <p> Ah, beg pardon, Century Rain is an alternate history.

  <p> Which just leaves us with Verity Auger. She is in Paris too. But shes
   not playing jazz. Auger is an archaeologist; one of those brave people
   whose job it is to dig into the ruins of Earth to try to find out what
   life was like on the planet before the Nanocaust.

  <p> Human society of the 23^rd Century is divided into two main political
   factions. The Slashers (short, I believe for Slash-Dotters) think that
   only further accelerated technological progress, particularly in the
   realm of nanotechnology, can save human civilization. In contrast the
   Threshers (short for Thresholders) believe that there are limits
   beyond which technology should not go (and beyond which it has already
   gone). Auger is a Thresher, which is why she is obsessed with the lost
   past.

  <p> The Slashers, of course, are merrily exploring space. They have found
   a network of wormholes left behind by a vanished civilization. At the
   far end of many of those wormholes they have found what they call
   Anomalous Large Objects (ALS) solar-sized manufactured hollow spheres.
   Inside each of those spheres is a planet, and on the inner surface of
   the spheres a whole fake sky: sun, stars, galaxies, the lot. It is
   just as if the old mediaeval idea of cosmology was true after all. And
   on a planet inside one ALS

  <p> Yes, youve got it, Century Rain is a delightful piece of genre
   blending.

  <p> A few things come to mind about the book. The first is that Reynolds
   clearly has a deep interest in jazz and that the book will mean more
   if you know the characters he talks about. The second is that Reynolds
   also has a keen appreciation of the difficulties of having to hold
   down a day job that isnt really what you want to do in order to be
   able to keep a roof over your head while you do the thing that you
   really love. Heres hoping that Reynolds is having rather more success
   than poor Floyd.

  <p> Of course with this being Reynolds there is also the physics to bear
   in mind. I rather like the idea of wormholes being made of
   "pathological matter" (and I have a sneaking suspicion that is a real
   physics term). Theres no FTL in the book with wormholes you dont need
   it. But some of the Slasher ships have something called a Bleed Drive
   which, if I have understood things aright, bleeds energy out of the
   zero point field (or maybe from the vast reservoir of vacuum energy,
   or they may be the same thing) to power the ship. And then there are
   the spheres. Not the ALS spheres, the little solid ones. I was so
   pleased with myself when I found that I had figured out what they were
   for correctly. It is all good stuff.

  <p> In the end, however, a story like this stands and falls on the quality
   of the plotting. Mysteries and thrillers require things to make sense.
   And Century Rain had rather too many points at which the authorial
   hand showed through and could be seen moving the puppets around. Thats
   sad, because Century Rain is a very entertaining, highly readable
   book. It might be 500 pages, but I read it very quickly. Unfortunately
   it was clear that what I was reading was an artifact and not a real
   story.

   

  <h> Business Unusual

  <p> Imagine for a moment that you have fallen into one of those classic
   parallel world fantasy scenarios. By some arcane means you are able to
   travel freely between our world and a parallel version of Earth that
   is still stuck in the Middle Ages and is full of kings and earls and
   knights and damsels. What do you do?

  <p> Quite correct, you set up an import/export business. Miraculous items
   can be brought from our world and sold at a huge profit in theirs.
   Important goods can be transported via our world in a fraction of the
   time it takes the medievals to get the job done. And certain sensitive
   goods that might have difficult being shipped through customs posts in
   our world can be safely stuck on the back of a mule in the other one.
   You could clean up.

  <p> All of this assumes, however, that you are not an ordinary fantasy
   reader, or indeed a fantasy writer. Instead you are Charlie Stross,
   king of hard-boiled, cutting-edge SF, writing a fantasy novel. You are
   the sort of person who, given a classic fantasy scenario, wants to do
   something very weird with it. Hence The Family Trade, in which Strosss
   heroine, Miriam Beckstein, discovers that she is actually a long-lost
   countess from a mediaeval society in a parallel world and her folks
   got rich by running the biggest, most successful drug-smuggling ring
   in the USA. Oh dear.

   <p>All of this depends on the ability to travel between worlds. Only
   Miriams family has the DNA that allows them to do it. And that is why
   the business is a family affair. It also explains why a long-lost pure
   blood member of the family (hereinafter called The Clan) turning up
   30+ years after she was presumed dead causes a big stir amongst The
   Clan. There are shifts in inheritance patterns to be calculated and,
   this being a mediaeval society, a marriage to be arranged. The Clan
   might bring a lot of interesting things back from our world, but
   Womens Lib is one thing they want firmly left where it is. This is not
   the sort of thing calculated to appeal to an independent-minded
   investigative journalist from Boston.

  <p> Then again, The Clan do tend to make the Mafia looks like a bunch of
   kind-hearted amateurs, so our Miriam is not going to have too many
   choices. "Do as you are told" and "dead" seem to be the limits of her
   options. Except that some Clan members are not very interested in the
   former.

  <p> So, what we are left with is the usual, fast-paced, rollicking,
   intrigue-filled Stross adventure with a plucky heroine, her dumb but
   SNAGy boyfriend, and more assassins that any girl really needs when
   she has just become a fantasy princess and needs to look her best at
   Court. Thank goodness for New York winters and a muff in which one can
   conceal a pistol. This isnt serious, Dorothy Dunnett style intrigue,
   it is much more popular thriller level stuff, but my goodness Mr.
   Stross has had fun here.

  <p> I suspect you will too. But you might want to be warned that Tor have
   done their by now usual trick of serializing the novel. The Family
   Trade is merely part I the first 300 pages of what will presumably be
   a 600-page novel and ending thoroughly in media res. Having spent a
   long time talking to David Hartwell about this, I understand the
   commercial reasons for doing it. But please Tor, if you are going to
   do this, can we have both halves of the book published in the same
   year so that we can put them back together for awards purposes?

 <h> The Long Game

   <p>Ive said this before and Ill say it again. Probably many times. In the
   field of science fiction, no one thinks bigger than Robert Reed. There
   is opera, there is space opera, and there is Reed. Compared to Reed,
   Wagners Ring looks like a small rubber washer. The paltry concerns of
   Norse Gods seem quite trivial on a galactic stage.
          ________________________________________________________

  <p> I was swimming through the Milky Way at one-third the velocity of
   unencumbered light. My engines were as big as moons, and I was bigger
   than most of my patrons home worlds: twenty Earth masses, and fifty
   thousand kilometers in diameter, with a hull whose surface area was
   nearly eight billion square kilometers.
          ________________________________________________________

  <p> When last we saw the Great Ship, in Marrow, the great war between the
   Captains and the Waywards resulted in some unexpected course changes.
   A near collision with a large black hole has sent the vessel careering
   off on a trajectory that will eventually take it out of the galaxy.
   You dont turn something like the Great Ship easily, at least not
   without the help of a big gravity field, nor when it is desperately in
   need of major repairs. So for the next few centuries it will have to
   follow pretty much the course it currently has. The new novel, The
   Well of Stars, tells that story.

  <p> Up ahead is a great black nebula known as the Inkwell. There are many
   dangers to the inter-stellar traveler. Black holes and asteroid fields
   are nasty, but small and easily avoided. Nebulae, on the other hand,
   might not be very dense, but they are huge. And a collision with even
   the smallest dust particle wont do you much good at one-third
   lightspeed. Well, unless your hull happens to be covered in the finest
   grades of hyperfiber and covered in batteries of lasers. Then again,
   nebulae contain billions upon billions of dust particles.

  <p> But if collision is not a major consideration for the Great Ship, what
   about the inhabitants of the Inkwell? Surveys show that there are
   definite signs of technological activity within that great cloud. Very
   sophisticated technological activity. And the inhabitants of the solar
   systems close to the nebula insist that it is inhabited. They are all
   scared stiff of whatever dwells within the cloud. The Great Ship has
   no choice but to trespass on the territory of some mighty and as yet
   unknown alien species. This causes the Master Captain some little
   concern.
          ________________________________________________________

  <p> "Were running out of time," she muttered.

 <p>  Eyes focused on the barren alien rock, she reminded everyone, "Weve
   got less than a hundred years to get ready and we still dont have any
   clear idea what for"
          ________________________________________________________

  <p> Less than a hundred years? Oops, better get on with some serious hard
   work then. Who knows what kind of life might have evolved in the
   black, starless skies of the Inkwell, and how mad it might be.

  <p> Well, as you might expect, battle ensues. And it is the sort of battle
   that makes the mere tossing around of black holes that you get in Wil
   McCarthy novels seem like a childs game of bows and arrows.

  <p> There are many ways in which I could attack Reeds novel. His cast of
   super-competent and immortal engineers and scientists are quite dull.
   The plot is, to a large extent, driven by the requirement to top each
   technological marvel with something even more awesome. Vast energies
   are expended on destruction; millions of sentient creatures die with
   barely a sentence to mark their passing.

  <p> Yet the novel is not entirely inhuman. At its core is the question of
   how small thinking creatures that have evolved sufficiently to give
   themselves enormous powers and seemingly endless lifetimes cope with
   the far greater vastness of the universe. In space you can be very,
   very alone. For all their manifest cleverness, few SF authors manage
   to convey just how big and awesome the universe really is. Robert Reed
   does.

  <p> I am reminded of a blog entry I made last week. Astronomers have
   discovered what they describe as the biggest explosion in the
   universe. It is driven by a black hole the size of a billion suns, and
   it has been burning for 100 million years. Robert Reed hasnt done
   anything quite that big yet. (Well, perhaps he did in Sister Alice I
   should check.) But I think we will. After all, bigger bangs have
   happened in the universe.

   You dont need to have read that story, but it does help. Someone who
   spent her first few thousand years trapped in an autodoc in a damaged
   spacecraft, unable to do anything except watch the stars outside her
   window, is just the sort of character that a Robert Reed novel needs.

  <h> Fantasy Politics

  <p> The tradition of small press companies publishing interesting new
   novels is continued by Prime with a debut novel from Welsh author,
   Bryn Llewellyn (whom I have never heard of before Wales isnt that
   small). The Rat and the Serpent continues the current fad for fantasy
   novels set in dark and mysterious cities. But on closer examination it
   has more in common with traditional fantasy than with China Miéville
   or K.J. Bishop. Allow me to explain.

  <p> The book is set in the city of Mavrosopolis, although it is known by
   many other names by different strata of society. Our hero, Ugli, is a
   "Nogoth", a homeless beggar with no civil rights. Although a cripple,
   he is possessed of considerable self-confidence, the powers of a rat
   shaman, and the guiding hand of the mysterious sage, Zveratu. Ugli
   decides that he will attempt to take the test to become a
   "citidenizen" so that he can have a home and a job. Thus begins his
   ascent through the social structure of the city, and our discovery of
   its true nature.

   <p>The best thing about the book is the city itself. I loved the idea of
   an ancient metropolis, covered in soot, whose rulers employ teams of
   people to scour it for water, wind and ice so as to prevent any of its
   structure being eroded. On the other hand, I have to say that words
   like Mavrosopolis and citidenizen do not exactly trip off the tongue.
   Unlike the last Prime book I reviewed, Catherynne M. Valentes The
   Labyrinth, which positively sits up and begs to be read aloud, The Rat
   and the Serpent skulks in the shadows where it hopes no one will speak
   it.

  <p> More generally Im not sure that Llewellyn ever got a handle on whether
   he was writing an allegory or an alternate world fantasy. With a lead
   character who is a beggar called Ugli the reader automatically expects
   an allegory. In addition the descriptions of Mavrosopolis are
   sometimes so cartoon-like in their portrayal of evil that the book
   feels more like Pilgrims Progress than a fantasy novel. But the book
   has many of the elements of traditional mythic fantasy, so presumably
   the world is supposed to be taken seriously.

  <p> It is the mythic fantasy angle that worries me most about the book. As
   you will have noticed from the plot summary above, the book is a
   classic "Lost Prince" tale. Ugli is clearly fated to take on the moral
   failings of Mavrosopolis and win. And so he does, very easily. This is
   not a book like Perdido Street Station that attempts to teach lessons
   about real world politics in a fantastical setting. It is more like
   The Book of the New Sun with most of the convoluted Wolfe puzzles and
   obfuscations removed and a wizardly guru added to help Severian out of
   any trouble he might get into on his way to becoming Autarch as the
   plot requires it.

  <p> That in itself is not necessarily a bad thing. Mythic fantasy has a
   long and honorable tradition. What worries me about The Rat and the
   Serpent is that the "wrongness" in the world that Ugli seeks to
   redress is nothing to do with the divine right of kings, the health of
   the Land, or any of the usual things that mythic fantasy addresses.
   Rather Ugli is fighting very real problems such as social injustice
   and corruption.

   <p>I am reminded of the two different approaches to alchemy during the
   Renaissance. Some alchemists were happy to see their craft purely as a
   spiritual journey; with the various chemical transformations they
   performed being an allegory for the development of the soul. Others
   genuinely believed that they could turn base metals into gold, and it
   was those alchemists who ended up getting executed by disappointed
   kings and emperors.

  <p> Mythic fantasy clearly has a place in literature, and there are things
   that it does very well. But it would be foolish of us to believe that
   the rightness of our cause can cure all of the ills of the real world.
   You wont find China Miéville introducing a Lost Prince who will save
   New Crobuzon from Evil. Indeed, much of the point of Iron Council was
   to say that such romanticism is hopelessly naïve. So although
   Llewellyn has his heart very much in the right place, the message he
   sends is nothing more than a comforting fantasy. It has no bearing on
   practical politics.

  <p> Here again I have gone off at one of those tangents where a
   philosophical aspect of a book has caught my interest. Doubtless this
   will once again have been hugely annoying to those people who believe
   that fiction is fiction and not supposed to "mean" anything. But Im
   rather more concerned about Bryn Llewellyn because The Rat and the
   Serpent is a better book than I have probably made it sound in this
   review. It has some interesting ideas, a new take on the cityscape,
   and some lovely imagery. And any book that causes me to think so much
   about its intentions has to be worth a read.

 <h>  In the Blood

  <p> Sometimes you find genre-bending in the most unexpected places. Stel
   Pavlou certainly isnt a name I was familiar with as an SF writer, and
   when Simon & Schuster sent me his new book, Gene, it clearly wasnt
   packaged as SF. Theres no hint of genre marketing on the cover, and
   Pavlous previous novel, Decipher, is described as a thriller. There
   are quotes from reviews in three national newspapers, including the
   Mail on Sunday, so it cant have any of that awful geek stuff in it,
   right?

  <p> Well I dont know about Decipher, but Gene, while certainly
   recognizably a thriller, has SF that Greg Bear might have written, a
   hefty lump of police procedural, a fair dose of history, and a small
   but essential hint of fantasy.
          ________________________________________________________

  <p> "A mans blood is dark and mortal," I pleaded. "Once it meets the
   earth, what song can it sing back? None. Yet I have sprung back from
   wormed torment? I should be dead!"

  <p> "Death is a skill you will find elusive." The Oracle washed her hands
   in the mixing bowl as if to wash her hands of me.
          ________________________________________________________

  <p> Genetic memory is a dodgy business. Just how much is hard-wired into
   our genes, and how much more might be? A lion cub learns to hunt by
   watching its mother, but an antelope knows how to run from the moment
   of birth? Do baby birds examine their nests to learn how to build one?
   They never see their parents actually build the thing. So much of what
   we are, it seems, comes packaged in that double helix at birth. And
   one piece of encoded information is much like another.

  <p> A woman is born fully equipped with every egg she will ever produce.
   Men, on the other hand, make new sperm on a regular basis. They do,
   after all, use them up at a frightening rate. What might they secrete
   away in those dynamic little packages of life? What part of themselves
   can they pass on to their sons?

  <p> In ancient Babylon the magus, Athanatos, discovers that a preparation
   of certain elixirs will cause a boy to remember things that happened
   to his father. Enough of the elixir, delivered at a young enough age,
   will cause those memories to flood and suppress the boys own
   personality. Athanatos has not quite discovered immortality, but he
   has made substantially more of the traditional male wish of
   immortality through your sons.

  <p> All goes well with his long, if punctuated, life, until the rise of
   the Greeks. Athanatos is in Crete, acting as a spy for Trojan raiders.
   It is the raid by Paris on Sparta that plunges the Eastern
   Mediterranean into a 10-year war, but it is an ordinary Cretan warrior
   called Cyclades whom the Greek gods choose to wreak their vengeance on
   the magus.

  <p> The cover of Gene shows the head of a bull, a typical piece of Minoan
   iconography. Its horns are twisted in a spiral reminiscent of the
   helical structure of DNA, and perhaps of two lives intertwined down
   the millennia. The bull, of course, is also a prime symbol of male
   power and aggression.
          ________________________________________________________

  <p> But let us not forget that Gene is first and foremost a thriller.
   Therefore we cannot start with any of these biological speculations,
   and certainly not with the machinations of Greek gods. We have to
   start with guns and car chases. Let us therefore repair to present day
   New York where NYPD detective James North has been called out to a
   hostage situation at Metropolitan Museum of Art. Some loony who seems
   to think he is an ancient Greek warrior has been terrorizing visitors
   with an old Bronze Age sword, and he seems to be remarkably adept at
   using it.

  <p> So the first fifty pages are spent in furious action and a chase
   around New York. The perp gets away, and much of the rest of the book
   is filled with Detective Norths efforts to track him down. Except that
   during their struggles the perp manages to inject North with a strange
   serum that turns out to be full of odd herbs and drugs. And from then
   on the Detective starts to suffer some very strange nightmares.

  <p> Pavlou carefully cuts the present day action with flashbacks through
   the centuries, charting the conflict between Athanatos and Cyclades
   backwards down the centuries. We visit the court of the alchemist
   emperor Rudolph in Prague, the lush palaces of Byzantium, the decadent
   court of Nero, and eventually the plains of Ilium themselves. There is
   much name-dropping of historical characters that might embarrass an
   experienced SF writer whose audience knows all these things already,
   but is doubtless fresh and new to thriller readers.

  <p> At the same time Palvou introduces the SF elements of the story. He
   talks of genetics and retroviruses. He does that classic novice SF
   author thing of writing a paragraph in which the characters talk about
   technical stuff and following it with a paragraph explaining what they
   were talking about. (This is probably essential for thriller readers,
   and as I recall Michael Crichton does it a lot.) Very quickly it
   becomes clear that a showdown is in the offing because at long last
   civilization has progressed to the point whereby Athanatos can both
   understand how his own elixir works, and discover how Cyclades keeps
   coming back to haunt him without any medical intervention.

  <p> I worried about the book for a long time, because there was something
   missing. Hollywood might think you can expunge the supernatural from
   the Trojan War, but no reputable author would attempt to do so.
   Thankfully Pavlou got there in the end, and it is this final addition
   to the mix that makes the ending crackle furiously.

  <p> It took me quite a while to get into this book. There is a lot of
   stuff there purely for the benefit of the thriller audience and an
   experienced SF&F reader will find some of it tiresome. But by the end
   I started to get quite impressed, because I dont think Pavlou was just
   writing a thriller, he was trying to say something about men.

  <p> Of course you dont expect much in the way of strong women characters
   in thrillers. But Gene is particularly notable for viewing its women
   through testosterone-tinted spectacles. Sure they are there, but they
   are all objects. Women are weak and unreliable, they are devious and
   treacherous, they cheat on their husbands, they are whores, they are
   hot, they are desirable, they are irresistible.

  <p> Cyclades himself is a complete shit. He spends ten years at war
   against Troy to win back his stolen wife, but it is very clear that he
   would have killed her in an instant had he thought that she had
   "betrayed" him by "allowing" a Trojan to have sex with her. Thankfully
   both his wifes ghost and Helen get to whisper in his ear, though that
   is entirely for our benefit and does him no good at all.

  <p> And let us not forget that the entire book is about the male wish for
   immortality through siring sons. Women are mere vessels in that
   process, and Im rather surprised that Pavlou didnt bring cloning into
   the equation to further emphasize the point. There are elements too
   that suggest that Cyclades, and maybe Athanatos as well, are deeply
   disturbed by the idea of androgyny. It is no accident that the goddess
   who sets Cyclades on his journey is Cybele. Presumably the whole role
   of women in the process of conception, all that combining of
   pernicious female DNA with the pure male strand, is deeply repugnant
   to them.

   <p>Overall, therefore, a very interesting book. A basic SF premise, some
   well-used fantasy elements, and in addition the way in which Detective
   North and his colleagues track down their perp is a nice piece of
   slow, painstaking police procedural. You might not find this book in
   the SF ghetto at bookstores, but it is worth looking out all the same.

  

  <h> Moving Shadows

  <p> When I started out on Shadowgod, the second volume of Michael Cobleys
   Shadowkings series, I was expecting more of the bleak and brutal tale
   that we had in the first volume. It is, after all, only the second
   volume, and if it were to follow the fantasy trilogy formula closely
   then book two should end with everything looking completely hopeless
   and the bad guys about the triumph. I wasnt alone either. Some of
   Cobleys characters had the same suspicions as to what was about to
   happen to them.
          ________________________________________________________

  <p> she and Gilly and Medwin were due to leave by ship for Sejeend and
   from there overland to Scallow in Dalbar. "An undertaking of some
   importance" Bardow had called it, which probably meant they would
   encounter trials of unsurpassing horror and peril.
          ________________________________________________________

  <p> Keren of course was right. Cobley does seem to save some his most
   horrible fates for the poor girl. But overall Shadowgod is much
   lighter in tone than its predecessor and, without giving too much
   away, it doesnt follow the formula that closely at all.

  <p> That is a good thing. It is always nice to see a writer of epic
   fantasy trying to do something different. But in other ways Cobley
   falls foul of some of the classic traps of the sub-genre. The most
   obvious one is runaway escalation of magic. As soon as you start
   involving demons and demigods and gods in the plot you very quickly
   get to the point where your ordinary human characters can have very
   little influence on the outcome of events. OK, so this is fantasy, so
   we know that Good is going to triumph in the end. But it is nice to
   think that the heroes had some active part in this, rather than simply
   being brave and loyal vessels through which the Good Gods express
   their powers.

  <p> The other issue that I have with the book is excessive wolf-crying.
   If, as an author, you bring a major character back from the dead very
   quickly, then no reader is going to believe you when you kill off
   other characters. Especially if you bring them back from the dead as
   well.

   <p>Other elements of the book are a lot more to my taste. Cobleys world
   is rather more real than those of many fantasy books. There are
   merchants and farmers and peasants as well as nobility. Some of his
   characters spend a lot of time worrying about how the royal treasury
   is going to raise enough money to pay the troops when the country is
   ravaged by war. And I particularly like the fact that some of the
   problems his heroes face include greedy merchants trying to make a
   profit out of the war effort and racist violence between the various
   elements of the anti-Evil coalition.

  <p> I should also note that Cobley writes just the sort of battle scenes
   that Peter Jackson would love. Tolkien did his best to make his
   battles come over as believable medieval warfare. Very little magic
   was involved. But you could see from the movies that what Jackson
   wanted to film was a succession of ever more over the top special
   effects as one great spell topped the next. Cobley has just the stuff
   for him. There are fortresses that grow themselves out of the ground,
   magical war machines that can demolish mighty city walls in a single
   blow, and vast regiments of creatures that can only be rendered with
   sophisticated CGI. Jackson would love it.

  <p> Im certainly looking forward to reading the final volume in the series
   because, having seen what Cobley has done in book two, I have no idea
   what he is going to do next (well, other than bring back a bunch of
   characters we are supposed to think are dead). But at the same time I
   am just enough divorced from the book world to compare it two the real
   one. Cobleys world has humanity uniting to face the menace of an Evil
   God who wants to destroy the world. In a fantasy novel that can be
   true. But in Iraq right now we have two groups of humans beating the
   hell out of each other because fanatics on both sides believe that the
   other side is working for an Evil God who wants to destroy them.
   Sometimes I think we are better off without fantasies.

  

  <h> Writers of the Future?

  <p> Anthologies can be very difficult things to review. Take this one for
   example. Australia has produced a lot of very good SF&F novelists over
   the past few years. Consequently many people want to follow in their
   footsteps. They now have their own Clarion workshop. So Maxine
   McArthur and Donna Maree Hanson of the Canberra Speculative Fiction
   Group have put together an anthology, Encounters. Im proud to have
   promoted a lot of good Australian writers in Emerald City, and I guess
   Im an obvious person to send the book too. Except that it is an
   anthology.

  <p> What does that mean for me? Well, there are 22 hopeful young writers
   in Encounters. All of them want to make it big as SF&F writers. How
   many of those are going to be the next K.J. Bishop? Very probably none
   of them. How many might be the next Sean McMullen, Sara Douglass or
   Cecilia Dart Thornton? One or two if they work at it. Those are the
   hard facts of life in the writing business. Not everyone will make it.
   It is brutal but it is true.

  <p> So I sit down to read and review this book, or any number like it, and
   what do I have facing me? That rather depends on how I look at it. If
   I were to put myself in the place of, say, Jonathan Strahan or David
   Hartwell trying to pick a "best of the year" anthology then certainly
   it would be none of them. If I put myself in the place of Ellen Datlow
   or Gordon van Gelder choosing stories for Sci Fiction or F&SF I might
   still choose none of them. But I know that Maxine McArthur and Donna
   Maree Hanson did choose these stories, and they will be the best of
   what was submitted.

  <p> I think it is easier with novels. There are far more opportunities to
   find something to praise. Theres plot development, theres world
   building, there are philosophical issues to be worked through. But
   short stories either work or they dont. There doesnt seem to be much
   middle ground, at least as far as I am concerned. And that makes
   anthologies (and fiction magazines) hard to review. Inevitably there
   will be a lot of material that I find uninspiring.

  <p> After all that I hope you will have come to the conclusion that anyone
   whose story in Encounters that I actually liked must be pretty damn
   good. Well, maybe not in Ted Chaing or Jeffrey Ford territory, but
   here are a few names to look out for. Lee Battersby is one of the most
   experienced authors in the anthology and his "Vortle" makes an
   excellent leadoff story. His aliens are both well drawn and amusing.

  <p> Dirk Flintharts "The Flatmate from Hell" is also amusing and has a
   serious point to make. Again the characters are good. You could tell
   from an isolated line if it was the vampire speaking. And I like the
   fact that his viewpoint character is drawn flawed, feeling herself
   cast into the Buffy role because her flatmates wont take on evil and
   then learning a lesson about the true nature of evil. Trent Jamiesons
   "Dont Got No Wings" is impressive for sustaining the dialect narration
   throughout. Michael Barry and Cat Sparks also produced stories that
   got me to take notice. As for the rest, and in addition to Maxine and
   Donna, I am very sorry; this was just not my sort of book.

  <p> For those of you who do like short fiction, the book isnt available
   from Amazon, but you can order it from the CSFG web site.

  

  <h> Look Forward in Hope

   <p>Pamela Sargent is one of those writers whom I have heard a lot about,
   keep meaning to read, and never quite get round to. There are a
   depressingly large number of people in that category. But thanks to
   Golden Gryphon, Sargent has been elevated from that position and has
   instead joined my "must read some of her other books" list. Im sorry
   if that doesnt sound a great step forward, but hey, there are just so
   many books.

  <p> The excuse for this change in status is Thumbprints. Sargent has had
   three other short story collections published. The last one, The
   Mountain Cage & Other Stories, came out in 2002. There doesnt appear
   to be any overlap between those two, and the previous collection was
   published in 1987 so clearly Sargent has a lot of material deemed
   collectable. Reading Thumbprints confirms the quality of her short
   fiction.

   <p>What readers may find slightly jarring about Thumbprints is that it
   contains a range of different types of story. There are two set in
   ancient Mongolia at the time of Genghis Khan. Two are what Sargent
   accurately describes in her afterword as "Twilight Zone" style
   stories. One is a straightforward ghost story used as a vehicle for
   exploring family relationships. The story "Thumbprints" is a crime
   story all about the villainous things that literary agents might get
   up to in order to make money out of authors whose careers are fading.
   And there are several straight SF stories. To my mind this simply
   highlights the breadth of Sargents talent, but I can see it would
   disturb those who prefer to only read certain types of story.

   <p>Then again, maybe it says a lot about me that it is the SF that
   interested me most. These are, after all, the stories that have most
   of a point to make. "Originals", for example, is a new take on the
   idea of a post-scarcity society. Most SF writers tackling this idea
   (e.g. see Ken MacLeods Newtons Wake) assume that once we have Drexler
   machines that can make any goods we want then people will naturally
   seek out that which cannot be duplicated, for which read human
   creativity. But Sargent agues that this will not automatically be the
   case. Most people, she argues, will be so overwhelmed, and so spoiled,
   by living in a world of plenty that they will be too lazy too seek out
   excellence unless they are actively sold on the idea. It is a rather
   depressing view, but I suspect that she may be right.

   <p>"Venus Flowers at Night" is essentially a prequel to Sargents Venus of
   Dreams trilogy, which is about a terraformed Venus and the first two
   volumes of which pre-date Kim Stanley Robinsons Mars trilogy. I want
   to read these books. But the story is not about the actual work, it is
   about the dream. It is set in a world beset by climate disaster in
   which a much-cowed USA is ruled from afar by a conservative Muslim
   empire. One of the Muslim lords, however, shares the American
   propensity to dream big. Sargent, it seems, worries that her country
   has lost the ability to dream.

   <p>My favorite story from the collection, "Utmost Bones", is also about
   dreaming. It is set at the far end of human time. A woman whose body
   is more machine than animal wakes from her latest resurrection to find
   herself alone in a tent in the wilderness. Slowly she discovers why
   she died, and what prompted her to wipe her memories before doing so.
   It is a depressing story, and echoes the themes from "Originals" and
   "Venus Flowers at Night" that humankind has become too lazy, or
   perhaps too fond of "safety" to dream about the future. And ultimately
   that will be the end of us. Sargent, I think, intends this as a
   much-needed wake-up call. Im with her.

  

  <h> Mouth Parts Watering

  <p> If you are looking for a way to get your book reviewed in Emerald
   City, here is a cunning plan you might like to try. Tell me that it is
   about food. The moment I heard about Jason Erik Lundbergs anthology,
   Scattered, Covered, Smothered, I knew that it was a book I had to
   read. It is, after all, subtitled "An anthology of food & fiction".
   And yes, it does contain actual recipes contributed by some of the
   writers (including Nalo Hopkinson whom I suspect is a very good cook).

  <p> I should start by praising the production of the book. Janet Chuis
   cover painting of a woman trying to cram a giant green octopus into a
   casserole dish is a perfect complement to certain parts of the fare on
   offer. And the book is produced spiral bound so that it can be laid
   open flat in the kitchen just like a real cookbook. Neat.
          ________________________________________________________

  <p> Subsequent encounters with other patrons suggest that the combination
   of ambiance and food in the Café had a profound effect.

  <p> "There shall gelatinous be our fate and the roilsome seas, and we
   shall take to it blissfully," one individual said.
          ________________________________________________________

  <p> Of course one of the things about an anthology about food is that it
   tends to get authors thinking in terms of kitchens, of hearths, and of
   families. This tends to lead inevitably to character-driven stories
   about family relationships: often mother-daughter or
   grandmother-granddaughter. There are stories in the anthology that you
   wont even recognize as speculative fiction, let alone SF for fantasy.
   Still, they are perfectly readable, if occasionally lacking in any
   obvious purpose.

  <p> The other obvious tack for a story about food is to talk about the
   relationship between recipes and spells, between cooking and alchemy,
   and in a more modern setting cooking and chemistry. These stories too
   permeate the book, and are of rather more interest to the SF reader.

   <p>There are also a series of Rhys Hughes poems about curry, which serve
   to reinforce just how delightfully disturbed Hughes can be. "You are
   as fickle as a Rogan Josh!" he writes to a sweetheart. Goodness, I
   hope not. Dump her, Rhys, shes trouble.
          ________________________________________________________

  <p> Deep Fried Ones For the truly hungry, a stick to the ribs meal of
   glistening fried meat, fibrous yet gelid, served with old fashioned
   barbecue sauce or twenty-year-old balsamic vinaigrette. A side of
   squid larvae is highly recommended as the perfect complement to this
   dish.
          ________________________________________________________

  <p> But the star contribution to the anthology, without a shadow of a
   doubt, is "The Strange Case of the Lovecraft Café" by M.F. Korn, Des
   Lewis and Jeff Vandermeer. As you may just have guessed, all of the
   quotations above are taken from that story, and there are lots more
   where they came from. Pan-Tossed Nemonymi From Yuggoth anyone? Flaming
   Whole Giant Penguin, delivered fresh from the Mountains of Madness?
   Darioles of Nethermost Blight in Black Being Sauce? I havent laughed
   so much in a long time. The book may well be worth the cover price for
   this story alone.
          ________________________________________________________

  <p> I must warn you not to peruse the menu items for very long at one
   sitting. Otherwise you may, as have I, feel the compulsion to create
   these dishes, and down that path, I fear, lies our complete and utter
   ruination.
          ________________________________________________________

   <p>Quite.

  <p> I cant find the book on Amazon. It is available direct from Lundbergs
   web site, but I hear rumors that the first print run may be sold out.

   

  <h> An Artist at Work

  <p> I dont normally review art books in Emerald City, and with good
   reason. I got chucked out of art lessons in school as soon as the
   curriculum regulations permitted my teachers to do so. If anything my
   drawing is actually worse than my singing, which will give some of you
   an inkling as to just how bad it is. Then again, there are people out
   there who think that I have no place reviewing fiction either, and
   Alan Clark was very encouraging when I expressed doubts about my
   suitability to comment on his work. He seems very happy for anyone to
   approach his work, regardless of artistic talent.

  <p> That becomes obvious very quickly from looking at the book. The Paint
   in My Blood is a retrospective of Clarks work and contains a wealth of
   images produced by him over the years. But it also contains short
   written sections by Clark in which he talks about his philosophy of
   art and explains some of the techniques he uses. He talks openly about
   the difficulties of working to spec when producing a book cover. And
   the hardcover edition even includes a CD with short films of Clark at
   work explaining what he does.

  <p> Being an illustrator of fiction, Clark is acutely aware of the
   potential for storytelling in art, and some of his opening comments
   struck an immediate chord with me. In parallel to the old writerly
   maxim, "show, dont tell", Clark adds a maxim for artists: "suggest,
   dont define." He adds, "If I provide only three out of five elements
   of a story, my audience is compelled to fill in the rest. This can
   make their viewing memorable and personally meaningful as they bring
   their own emotional experiences to the process."

  <p> This makes a lot of sense to me, and probably explains why I find
   Constable paintings incredibly dull but have a fascination for
   Salvador Dalì. It also explains my love of Richard Dadds wonderful
   "The Fairy Fellers Master Stroke". Im not terribly interested in art
   that is merely a perfect rendition of what the artist is looking at. I
   like pictures that tell a story, and that is exactly the sort of
   picture that Alan Clark likes to paint.

  <p> The passion that Clark has for involving his audience in his artwork
   is nowhere more starkly demonstrated than in the "Deadwood" series of
   paintings that is included in The Paint in My Blood. Clark says, "With
   the Deadwood pieces I want the viewer first to believe he is looking
   at corpses, then realize these shapes are composed of merely sticks,
   leaves, rocks, and so forth. Finally after careful study, he may find
   evidence of a real corpse, but hopefully only after he has reassured
   himself that there are no actual dead bodies in the piece."

  <p> I should note here that Clarks work is mainly within the horror genre,
   and while he is clearly very talented I dont think I would sleep well
   at night if I had too many Alan Clark pictures on my walls. Then
   again, sometimes he is so good I would buy works anyway if I could
   afford them. I particularly like his fish (possibly an echo of too
   much time spent watching Stingray as a kid). The paintings, "City
   Fishing" and "Between the Devil & the Deep Blue Sea" are particularly
   wonderful.

  <p> Clark has done SF work, however, and has a much cleaner, brighter
   style for it. He has this wonderful knack of taking everyday objects
   with a streamlined appearance and using them as the basis for images
   of starships. "Fishing Reel Ships" is a favorite of mine.

  <p> Im sure that people with more artistic skill than I possess will get a
   lot more out of Clarks book that I did. In particular they will have
   intelligent things to say about Clarks discussions of technique. But I
   can tell you that The Paint in my Blood is not just a book of
   beautiful (and often deeply disturbing) pictures. It is a book by
   someone who very much wants to reach out to his audience, whoever they
   might be.

  <p> Yet another book that you need to go to the publishers web site to
   order. Here.

  <h> Interview: Immanion Press

  <p> One of the most active small press companies in the UK is part owned
   by a very successful fantasy writer, Storm Constantine. She and her
   business partner, Gabriel Strange, started Immanion Press (IP) (named
   after the capital city in Constantines famous Wraeththu books) in
   2003. The company already has 17 books in print, with a further 20
   titles planned for this year. I spoke to Constantine and Strange about
   how all this came about.

  <p> CHERYL: Lets begin by putting something to rest. When people see an
   author start a publishing company they might be tempted to think,
   vanity publishing, but Storm is still a very successful writer. The
   new Wraeththu series is being published in hardback by Tor, who are
   probably the biggest SF publisher in the world, correct?

  <p> GABRIEL: Technically the company is a partnership, between us both. I
   would say this discounts it being a vanity press, because we have the
   two of us and we tend to pull each other in if we go too far. Also, we
   are concentrating on other authors and bringing new authors into the
   fold. Anyway I think Storm has more to say on this.

  <p> STORM: The reason Gabriel and I started Immanion Press initially was
   to republish my out of print back catalogue novels. Unless youre one
   of the very few big name authors, you cant expect to see your work
   staying in print for long, which is annoying for both writers and
   their loyal readers. At the beginning, I think both Gabriel and I just
   regarded IP as an extension of other services that we offer fans, but
   then other author friends began to get in touch with us, asking, "will
   you do my back catalogue too?" and then a few new authors sent us
   great manuscripts that we couldnt bear not to publish! So we had to
   think again, and decided to press ahead as a bona fide small
   publisher.

  <p> STORM: Personally, I dont really care if some people regard me
   bringing out my own work as vanity publishing. It sells, and my work
   (and that of other established writers we publish) keeps the company
   going, allowing "unknowns" to be published. We get so much amazing
   writing to look at, and sometimes Im astounded that major publishers
   have turned it down. Were very glad to be able to give these writers a
   chance. Once theyve had something out through us, it might be easier
   for them to sell to a major, for more money, next time.

  <p> CHERYL: On the Immanion web site you talk about books "having the
   shelf life of a magazine" these days. This is something you obviously
   feel strongly about.

  <p> GABRIEL: Yes we both do. Think what place we would be in now if great
   authors like Tolkien and Shakespeare had had a shelf life of a month.
   Personally its not a world I would like to be in. With the rapid
   recycling of books, classics are not made because they endure the test
   of time; they are made on the whims of fashion and intensive
   marketing.

 <p>  GABRIEL: One example of the way the current publishing industry is
   working is China Miévilles latest book, Iron Council, which was
   released mid September 2004. It has now been remaindered and sold off
   by his publisher to discount stores. And its now only January 2005.
   Thats three months of shelf life for that book before it was pulled
   out and basically dumped. Other books, and popular ones at that, have
   a shelf life of one month, before being remaindered or pulped. Im not
   sure what book turnover in the US is like but in the UK it really does
   seem that some magazines last longer than a novel now.

  <p> STORM: I agree totally with Gabriel on this one. Sadly, the advent of
   the personal computer means thousands more people now write novels,
   because its much less of a chore than it used to be. I wrote my first
   two novels in longhand and then on a cranky old typewriter, with
   multiple revisions and drafts. Now, that was work! There are so many
   more authors nowadays, the market is absolutely flooded, and
   unfortunately not all of what comes out is that good.

  <p> STORM: It especially galls me that good writers get shunted to the
   side, because their work is challenging or cross-genre, and typically
   the lesser talented writer is more vocal, pushy and confident than the
   highly talented one, who is often loath to blow her own trumpet. (A
   sad but true fact noted from editing experience with magazines over
   the last 15 years or so.) Publishers want to publish new writers
   constantly, flinging wads of them at the wall in the hope that some
   will stick (i.e. sell). Most of them are one novel wonders, who you
   never hear of again, because they dont get the long term back up from
   their publisher that they need.

  <p> STORM: There was one author in particular, a young lad, who got a
   six-figure advance for a fantasy novel that was hailed as the Next Big
   Thing. It sank, and he is now forgotten. It would be virtually
   impossible for him to sell another book, because of his reputation.
   Its better to start small and grow naturally. Youre more likely to
   endure. Big publishers dont support that, but small presses like IP
   do. We look on every book we bring out as special. We want every one
   of them to sell well. Sometimes, this might take time, but because the
   books have a longer shelf life we can keep promoting them and their
   authors, and hope that a following will build up from word of mouth
   and so on.

  <p> CHERYL: Although you have a US publisher for the books, Immanion is
   doing the British versions of the new Wraeththu series. Is the UK
   market harder to crack, less diverse in its tastes, or what?

  <p> GABRIEL: I would say the UK is harder to crack, as the number of shops
   being controlled by big corporate bosses makes it hard to sell a book
   which may only sell 1,000 units a year. It seems publishing is about
   fast turn over and high profits at the moment and with a market like
   that the larger publishers are looking for some angle to spin a new
   author from.

  <p> STORM: I couldnt place the new Wraeththu trilogy with a UK publisher,
   even though Tor in the States had snapped it up within a week of my
   agent sending it them, so we started doing some of my new novels in
   the UK too. This is now also the case with Ian Watson and Brian
   Stableford. Weve purchased both of their new novels here in the UK.
   Its a sad state of affairs, but more and more established authors in
   this country, who have big followings, can no longer get published
   here. But the good side of it is that more independent publishers like
   us are springing up to fill the gap. I believe David Langford and
   Christopher Priest have started a company, and I know that friends of
   Tanith Lee have set up Egerton Press to publish some of her work I
   hope they bring out some of her back catalogue again too. Tanith has
   written some classics that should definitely be still available.

  <p> CHERYL: I see you are listing your edition of The Wraiths of Will and
   Pleasure as a "UK revised edition". Can we assume that is an authors
   preferred version, and how different is it to the Tor version?

  <p> GABRIEL: This is the main advantage of DIY publishing. Editors might
   cut content based on the current political climate and social values.
   However, we believe a book is for life not just for Christmas, so the
   current world state should not affect what is still classified as an
   art form. So we add the cut content back in, as well as bonus material
   for the fans. At the end of the day, if people are prompted to think
   about what is written in a book all the better. I hate it when a book
   I read has nothing memorable about it and nothing to think about
   afterwards. I think Storm can add more specifics about the book
   itself.

  <p> STORM: There are several reasons why theres an authors preferred
   version. First, there were little bits I thought about once the
   manuscript had been delivered to the American publishers, and there
   were mistakes that needed correcting. One reader spotted that a
   particular character had the wrong name through an entire scene,
   (which appeared in the US edition), and I cant tell you how many times
   Id read it, or editors had read it. There were a few areas I wanted to
   expand, to fit in with later ideas. As for specific content, which
   Gabriel mentioned, its more to do with me than any requirements of my
   publisher in the States. I know things have got a lot more
   conservative recently, so I trimmed some of the more erotic scenes in
   the last volume, The Ghosts of Blood and Innocence, for the US
   edition, which are there in their full glory in the IP edition. I must
   point out I wasnt asked to do this; it was just what I felt I wanted
   to do. In the past, Ive been asked to cut scenes simply from a page
   length point of view, but so far (knocks wood) I havent been overtly
   censored.

 <p>  STORM: Also, from a marketing point of view, we want to make the UK
   editions special. We cant compete with a big publisher, but we thought
   we should produce editions that fans would want to collect, including
   various appendices, expanded scenes, etc.

  <p> CHERYL: You also list 2003 editions of the original Wraeththu series.
   Again, are they very different?

  <p> GABRIEL: Yes they have been completely revised and updated to remove
   any inconsistencies and bring them in line with the new trilogy. They
   are what we call a collectors edition, which will soon be removed from
   print and distributed as an omnibus collection without the appendices,
   and again over to Storm to give more details.

  <p> STORM: The first Wraeththu books are really what set IP off. I had
   sent the proposal for the new trilogy out to publishers in the States
   and UK, and had pulled the original books down off my shelves to
   reacquaint myself with the details of the Wraeththu world. I thought
   the books should come out again in the UK, since theyd been out of
   print for a long time. (The US edition is still in print.) The first
   thing that struck me was how bad the grammar was in book one, and how
   many plot holes there were or rather the plot was extremely wobbly. I
   was itching to re-edit the books, using my experience as an editor of
   other writers work over the past ten years. My editor head just
   couldnt bear the thought of these books coming out again in such bad
   shape! Anyway, to cut a long story short, once I realized I wasnt
   going to get a UK publisher to look at Wraeththu stuff, of any kind,
   and Gabriel and I had decided to produce the first trilogy again
   ourselves, I got to work on them. Tor werent interested in the new
   editions, mainly I think because theyd just reprinted the Omnibus
   edition they have, and had a lot of them to sell.

  <p> STORM: The books are groomed, but not essentially different in that I
   took care to preserve the tone and style of the original writing.
   There is also a lot more background material included to give the plot
   a backbone. I moved scenes around, and added more to give coherence
   and depth. For example, the end of book one was originally simply a
   newspaper report, outlining what had happened to Pellaz and Caeru in
   Immanion (the city in the books, not our press!). I thought, no, that
   wont do, and rewrote the lot from Pells perspective. It added a couple
   more chapters to the end, but I think made the book a lot stronger. I
   dont know why my original editor let me get away with a throwaway
   ending like that. I certainly wouldnt allow one of my authors to do
   it!

  <p> CHERYL: Immanion also publishes books by a range of other authors.
   Some are newcomers and others are well-respected British authors that
   have been prematurely discarded by publishers. Ian Watson is an
   obvious example of the latter. How did you come to have him in your
   stable?

   <p>GABRIEL: Well we do advertise ourselves wherever we can, and many of
   these authors have come to us. Recently we have signed up Tom Arden,
   Brian Stableford and Michael Moorcock (back catalogue work). I think
   over the next year we will probably get more established authors who
   want to see their work back in print. Oh, and talking of advertising
   everywhere we can, the submission guidelines are on our web site and
   submissions can be sent to editorial@immanionpress.wox.org.

  <p> STORM: I cant really add anything to that. Ian heard about us and
   contacted us, and we were delighted to take him on. His work is
   amazing and its ridiculous it hasnt stayed in print.

  <p> CHERYL: Ians Mockymen was one of my top ten SF books of 2003, so Im
   delighted you are doing a UK edition. What attracted Immanion to the
   book?

  <p> GABRIEL: Well to be honest, it was available, and when you get offered
   a recent book which is so highly praised you have to take it. I think
   this was one of the books we did not have to read to know that we
   would take it. I know the major publishers turned the book down in the
   UK. This would mean a great book like this would be sold only on
   import or through specialist bookstores.

  <p> STORM: This is true. I copy edited Mockymen and really loved it.
   Again, its ridiculous the majors turned it down.

  <p> CHERYL: I took a look at the submissions area of your web site and I
   very much like your guidelines as to what you dont want. Is there
   anything you would like to add to the guidelines on the site?

  <p> GABRIEL: Not that I can think of, Storm might want to.

  <p> STORM: Whenever I get a submission, I see it from both sides: the
   writer who has probably sweated blood and tears to create their baby
   and the editor who has to assess it. I hate having to reject work, but
   I really cant take anything thats derivative or has been done a
   thousand times before. Also, I like solid, character driven stories,
   which are credible. I read so many where the characters behave in a
   totally unbelievable fashion, which jerks me out of the story and then
   the writer has lost me as a reader. I go for a strong, confident
   style, in which the author has a definite individual voice that shines
   out from the first line of the book. Voice, thinking about it, is
   perhaps the most important thing. You can tell a familiar tale, that
   many authors have told, but if you do so in your own strong voice, it
   makes it different to any other.

  <p> STORM: Im also amazed how many writers just sling out novels with
   virtually no grasp of English language. Sometimes we get a fantastic
   idea but the execution is tortuous! Occasionally, you see a good
   writer struggling to get out, and then I or one of our other editors
   will spend a lot of time coaching them. But unfortunately, we dont
   have enough spare time to hand hold every one that comes along. If I
   have one piece of advice, its please brush up your grammar, syntax and
   punctuation before sending books off to publishers. If its difficult
   for an editor to read your work, youll have far less chance of placing
   the book.

  <p> CHERYL: Have you got a lot of writers and artists through Storms
   existing network of fans, or do people generally come to you cold?

   <p>GABRIEL: Yes we do get quite a few cold submissions, and a lot of fan
   submissions. We try to pick the best of both, as its amazing the
   untapped talent you get in many fan communities.

  <p> STORM: We get submissions from all over. From the fan base, weve
   picked up a few Wraeththu fanfic authors, whose work were publishing
   as Wraeththu Mythos novels. The first of these was Breeding Discontent
   by Wendy Darling and Brigitte Parker. (Wendy is also one of our
   editors, and she edits all my work.) The next one to appear will be
   Victoria Copuss Terzahs Sons, which we plan to bring out in July.
   After that, I think it will be Kris Dottos Rosa Mundi I believe shes
   nearly finished it, although Wendy will be editing that one.

  <p> STORM: I do just want to say a bit about submissions in general
   though. The worst ones are from people who havent bothered at all to
   check us out and discover what kind of work we publish. Theyll send us
   religious tracts or cheesy soft porn. Its kind of insulting when
   someone does that. We also get manuscripts from people that are really
   dire and when we let them down gently, they write back to us
   furiously, telling us that we must be mad to reject them and that if
   we have any sense at all, and are not complete charlatans, well
   reconsider. Well quite. (In the bin with it!) The best writers are
   always, ironically, the most humble ones, who are full of doubts; the
   worst are just full of themselves!

  <p> CHERYL: It is hard to believe that Michael Moorcock has back catalogue
   works that are out of print, but I guess he has been very productive.
   I know that Savoy have some of his very early work. What do you have?

   <p>GABRIEL: For now I can say we are doing a combined volume of the two
   Jerry Cornell books; these were The Chinese Agent and The Russian
   Intelligence. They are combined into one book now called Jerry
   Cornells Comic Capers, due out later this year. We cannot say if well
   have access to other books of his yet.

  <p> STORM: To be fair, I think its the more obscure and stand-alone novels
   that Mike doesnt have in print at the moment. I do hope hell let us do
   more, but as most of them are tenuously connected with his Multiverse,
   and there will soon be an Elric movie, I wouldnt be surprised if a
   major publisher wants to republish some of his back catalogue in the
   near future. Well, if they have any sense they will do, anyway!

  <p> CHERYL: Tom Arden is another favorite author of mine. Looking at the
   cover, I would guess that The Translation of Bastian Test is set in
   Victorian times. Is it some sort of H.G. Wells style adventure?

  <p> GABRIEL: Yep Bastian Test is just that. I cannot say much about the
   plot without giving it away. Storm will probably tell you more as she
   edited the book.

  <p> STORM: I edited Bastian and thoroughly enjoyed doing so. It has a
   style and flavor all of its own and the characters are great. It might
   have a slight dusting of Wells (in its central idea), but is
   essentially Toms own creation and somewhat cross-genre. Its a
   scientific romance/fantasy/slipstream novel. Difficult to categorize.

  <p> STORM: Bastian is the son of a famous and eccentric artist who dies in
   a mysterious fire. Left alone in the world, he discovers he has a
   bizarre heritage and a new guardian who lives in a crumbling old
   castle in Scotland. His guardian is something of a mad scientist,
   engaged in arcane experiments. He lives with what can only be
   described as a menagerie of unusual people. Bastian finds himself in
   the middle of a sinister plot, and is also bewitched by a pair of
   seductive twins, who are staying nearby. Its a testament to Toms skill
   as a writer that he can create a character as attractive as the twin,
   Fleance, even though he goes into somewhat grim detail about the boys
   acne! By the time this interview appears, the book should have been
   released.

  <p> CHERYL: Brian Stableford is another wonderful British author who is
   being sadly neglected by the big publishers at the moment. You
   mentioned that you will be publishing some of his work.

  <p> GABRIEL: Yes, Curse of the Coral Bride and Sheena and other Gothic
   Tales. Both of these books were either turned down or could not be
   published by other small presses. Both are excellent books and have
   never been published before, so I hope his fans are eager to get their
   hands on them. However, on a side note, we have experienced some
   technical difficulties with the first books cover but we are back on
   track now.

  <p> STORM: Yeah, Curse of the Coral Bride had to be delayed, due to
   problems the cover artist had. Hes Ade Daniel, who did the cover for
   Ians Whores of Babylon. Hes a wonderful artist, so we know itll be
   worth the wait.

  <p> CHERYL: There are also many names on your author list that I am not
   familiar with. Are there any new writers you have signed up that you
   particularly want to highlight?

  <p> GABRIEL: I will pick one and Ill let Storm pick one. I would say
   Digging up Donald by Steven Pirie is one of my favorites. I think my
   words to Storm after reading the first line were "We have to take this
   book." Its basically a dark British comedy, which blends the humor of
   League of Gentlemen with the brain of Victoria Wood; to be honest, my
   words cannot do this book justice. So go out and buy it, you will
   laugh, cry and maybe even have a life changing experience

  <p> STORM: Donald is one my favorites too. Its so well written. Another
   marvelous novel is Oliphan Oracus by Neil Robinson. It too has a wry
   humorous style, but as Donald does it tweaks every emotion. Very
   powerful writing. It deserves to win an award, I think. Oliphan is
   more SF than horror, and is set in a future world. Of those Ive edited
   recently, but are not yet in print, I loved Necromantra by Philip
   Emery, which is a dark Gothic tale set in an alternative world, a sort
   of 1930s Potteries. The Potteries is an industrial area in England
   where well pottery is made. Necromantra is delightfully atmospheric,
   heaving with smog and phantoms and arcane terms for machinery and
   mining and a host of debilitating conditions and diseases! You really
   feel like youre there when youre reading it; perfect virtual reality.
   I absolutely love it.

  <p> CHERYL: There are two questions I ask every small press I interview.
   The first is about Print on Demand: are you for, against, or agnostic?

  <p> GABRIEL: Well, Print on Demand is the revolution of the future. We
   would be lost without it, as it offers us convenience and quality
   control in one package. We dont have to worry about warehousing or
   storage and a book will never go out of print.

  <p> STORM: POD has had a lot of bad press, which the most reputable
   companies are striving hard to overcome. Its regarded by some as
   vanity publishing again, but the company we work with will only take
   accounts from genuine publishers, not from wannabe writers who have no
   editor and so on. Although the unit costs are higher than with
   traditional publishing, there are the benefits that Gabriel described,
   where you have minimal overheads. As well as the storage aspect, you
   dont have to shell out for a huge initial print run (which can cost at
   least £10,000) since the books are printed literally as theyre
   demanded, i.e. ordered. It has certainly put publishing within the
   reach of many more small presses. Weve been really pleased with the
   quality of the books weve had printed.

  <p> CHERYL: The other standard question is about distribution. A lot of
   American small presses seem to manage to get their books into
   bookstores. I get the impression that it is much more difficult in the
   UK. Is that correct?

   <p>GABRIEL: Yes, the major UK stores are controlled from the head office;
   the stores themselves have little or no autonomy. This makes it hard
   to sell a local author, as that author will get good sales in their
   hometown but in the bigger picture they wont hold up. It also means a
   book has to sell X number of units to be viable for the big stores to
   take it.

  <p>STORM: This is definitely the case. Some chains, such as Ottakars,
   support small presses, but on the whole bookstores demand such huge
   discounts that it makes it unviable for us to sell to them.

   <p>CHERYL: Back with the product line, I see you are publishing a
   Wraeththu role-playing game. It is ages since I played one, but I
   guess there must still be a demand for such things.

  <p> GABRIEL: Yes there is a demand for role-playing. However, the sales
   base has not significantly increased over the past 5 years. Also, in
   my honest opinion, there has been nothing new in the industry for the
   past 10 years. I have role-played for over 20 years now and in my
   maturity as a role-player I want more than a sword wielding fighter or
   a gun-toting nut. This made me wonder how many other people out there
   are like me. Wraeththu offers a setting which is truly unique and
   styles around a more mature level of role-playing. At the end of the
   day, role-playing is a great pastime for people of any age. Some
   people find escapism in soap operas, but there is a bigger world out
   there and the infinite worlds of the mind, all of which can be
   explored through role-playing. Not to mention that role-playing in
   general can be used as a fun educational tool; this is ignored by many
   people. There is more information about the Wraeththu RPG on our web
   site.

  <p> STORM: This is Gabriels area. I know nothing about role-playing but
   had immense fun working on the game book, thinking up lots of fine
   detail for the world of Wraeththu.

   <p>CHERYL: I confess to being a role-playing rules geek. Is there
   anything new and innovative in your game system that you are
   particularly proud of?

   <p>GABRIEL: Yes, the fact that we have not tried to come up with the next
   big rule or dice mechanic. Out of the thousands of rules systems on
   the planet, everything has been done, and the best mechanics have
   stood the test of time. So we adopt and adapt the best ideas and add a
   few of our own. The biggest differences to mainstream rules systems
   are the combat and magic. The combat is deadly, and based around the
   characters physical abilities, skill and type of weapon, as the
   concept of you hit, I hit is a bit annoying. So in combat the
   characters that do best are the ones who think and use their abilities
   to their best advantage. For magic, I took a different approach. I did
   not want to have hundreds of spells; I wanted to have a system where
   you can do anything, providing you can describe how it works. We have
   explained in the book how magic functions in the world and what the
   characters cannot do. To that we have added a set of building blocks
   and the rest is down to how you play it.

  <p> CHERYL: Hmm, that sounds just like my sort of game. I tried for ages
   to come up with that sort of magic system but could never manage it.
   But then I dont have Storms in-depth knowledge of magic.

  <p> CHERYL: Talking of which, another non-fiction line that you have is
   books about magic. Serious theoretical books. It is clear to me from
   reading your novels, Storm, that this is something you know a lot
   about. But I guess other people may find it a strange thing for a
   fantasy writer to do: a bit like an SF writer talking about UFOs.

  <p> STORM: To me, my magic and my writing have always gone hand in hand,
   throughout my life. I teach witchcraft, Egyptian magic and Reiki to
   augment my writing career. It amuses me really when I read stuff in
   some fantasy novels that is supposed to be magic. To me, its like
   someone who has never worked on an oilrig trying to describe the
   minutiae of day-to-day events in such an environment. I can see the
   gaps and the holes and the misunderstandings. Real magic is not about
   special effects, or wizards zapping each other with spells. Its a meld
   of quantum mechanics, probability theory and psychology with the odd X
   factor thrown in that you really cant explain.

  <p> STORM: One thing that both Gabriel and I felt that we wanted to do
   when we started IP was to eventually have a separate esoteric
   non-fiction list. Weve only got a few titles so far, so it doesnt
   warrant a separate imprint, but hopefully that will come in the
   future. As with the fiction, were looking for different, cutting-edge
   and challenging works. So no fluffy, watered down paganism or anything
   to do with teen witches. Im not against teenagers being into magic,
   but I hate that whole cozy, hip teen witch thing, as if its an
   accessory for Barbie or something! I.E. "how cool are your spells?"
   and "make sure you wear the right make up for ritual". Oh, please!
   (Sorry, a rant was brewing.)

  <p> CHERYL: Can you tell me a bit about the Grimoire Dehara: Kaimana that
   you have on your forthcoming books list?

  <p> STORM: One thing that was missing from the original Wraeththu books
   was a fully worked out system of magic. This was more to do with the
   fact that I was still a novice myself at the time, working with
   various teachers to learn more. I wasnt equipped then to create the
   system. However, nearly 20 years on, I am, so I spent a lot of time
   working everything out. It occurred to me that, from a Chaos Magic
   perspective, Id created a system that was viable, and as workable as
   any other model. At one time, every magical system on Earth was new,
   and just because something is new doesnt mean it isnt valid. Wicca is
   a prime example of that. From the evidence Ive read, Im convinced
   Gerald Gardner made it all up in the 1950s, with help from others,
   cobbling together bits and pieces from other systems to create his
   own. This is not a criticism; the system was elegant and it worked. It
   still does. Also, even though H P Lovecraft was not into magic
   himself, several different systems have evolved based entirely on his
   fictional mythos and they work too. With these inspirations in mind, I
   set to work.

  <p> STORM: For Dehara, I got together a group of people, mainly those into
   magic from the fandom, and created an online group to work on the
   rituals, experiment, and see what came out. Grimoire Dehara: Kaimana
   is the result of that work. Some people had more input than others,
   and they get full credit for what they did. Were still working on it.
   The Wraeththu system consists of three tiers of three levels each, and
   the first book represents the first three tiers Kaimana. As Gardner
   did, weve called upon systems and practices that we already know and
   have adapted and added to them to create something different. So, to
   anyone who reads it, I hope it will be both familiar and fresh at the
   same time.

  <p> CHERYL: Some of the small presses I have talked to attend a lot of
   conventions, but you guys actually run a convention: Grissecon. I
   guess this is a result of starting with an established fan base for
   Storms work.

  <p> GABRIEL: Yep, Grissecon actually started before Immanion Press. Storm
   is best telling you the history. However, currently we have a track at
   Lunacon in NYC next March. Then in July weve got a track at Feencon in
   Bonn, in Germany. The concept of Grissecon is to offer the
   unconventional at a convention. We try to come up with panel ideas
   which blend topics and concepts and offer different points of view.
   Also, we dont stick to a rigid set of guidelines for the questions. We
   tend to throw things open to the audience so they can put people on
   the spot. This offers a much more organic and exciting panel.

  <p> STORM: Grissecon began life in the Stone Inn chat room, which is an
   online meeting place for people into Wraeththu. I drop in there
   occasionally, and one night was talking to a few women and we thought
   it might be a nice idea to have a social weekend some time, when we
   could perhaps meet up in a hotel and talk about our interests. Some of
   them had known each other for years, but had never met in the flesh,
   as it were. As England was pretty central to where everyone lived, I
   said Id try and find a venue. Then more people got to hear about it
   and eventually I realized Id have to organize a proper event. It all
   went very well, considering our inexperience as con-runners, but we
   learned a lot very quickly. We had to!

  <p> STORM: On the strength of the first Grissecon, we were asked to run a
   track at the massive Dragon*Con in Atlanta last September. It was
   called Gothic Journeys, and included events associated solely with my
   work as well as more general Gothicly inclined subjects. It was a
   fabulous success, but it costs too much to get us all over there, and
   it doesnt look like the committee wants to pay for my team to go out
   there again. Theyre still running the Gothic Journeys track, I hear,
   but I dont know who theyll get to be in charge of it. I cant help
   thinking, smugly, that it wont be as good as when we did it!

   <p>STORM: Well carry on moving Grissecon around, as the fans are spread
   out all over the place. As Gabriel said, this year well have tracks at
   Lunacon and Feencon. Possibly, in 2006, well do another independent
   Grissecon thats not part of another convention. The main problem with
   that is having the time to organize it. Hitching a lift on someone
   elses con saves a lot of time and worry.

   <p>CHERYL: How did the relationship with Lunacon come about?

  <p> GABRIEL: Well its a bit of a tale Well not quite. In 2004 Storm was
   invited as GoH at Lunacon. She asked if two of her staff could come,
   who were Lydia and I. I think it was a combination of our open and
   friendly attitude to people and that we would help out where we could,
   and that we connected with the staff of Lunacon straight away. Anyway,
   at the end we all said we wished there was a way we could come back
   next year. So one of the Lunacon staff talked with the 2005 chairman
   and got us some funding and a room allocated, so we could do our track
   with them. As far as Im aware we are the first track to be accepted at
   Lunacon and we will be back again in 2006. We hope to bring a new
   younger audience to the convention and get a whole new generation of
   convention goers. For more information on Grissecon and where we will
   be next visit see here.

   <p>STORM: Cant add to that really!

  <p> CHERYL: Will your fans be able to see you at the Worldcon in Glasgow
   this year?

  <p> GABRIEL: Due to the cost of getting there, having a stall, and paying
   for accommodation, we have had to neglect Glasgow. I think its a
   matter of timing and financial viability. At the end of the day, we
   cannot go to a convention and make a loss. Its a case of taking a risk
   on a convention where we have no track record versus a convention
   where we know we can cover our costs. We would love to go, but we do
   need to survive.

  <p> STORM: This is true, unfortunately. Were hoping to go to Novacon in
   England next year, which we know will be a good event, and there is a
   limit to how many conventions we can attend.

 

  <h> Fantasy Masterwork

  <p> Whatever else we might hope for out of the publishing industry, there
   seems little doubt that literary criticism is not going to sell in
   huge quantities. Occasionally there is a potential best seller, and
   when Michael Moorcock decided to write a book about epic fantasy back
   in the 1980s his name was big enough for Gollancz to pick up the
   title. Yet even that book, Wizardry & Wild Romance, has been out of
   print for years. Which, as China Miéville says in his introduction to
   the new MonkeyBrain Books edition, is scandalous.

  <p> MonkeyBrain have done three very good things with their edition. Most
   importantly they have rescued a very good book from obscurity.
   Secondly they have given it an absolutely stunning John Picacio cover.
   And finally they have persuaded Moorcock to update the contents. Not
   that his conclusions needed any significant modification, but it has
   allowed him to include the younger generation of fantasy writers
   (Bishop, Ford, Miéville, Vandermeer, etc.) in his considerations. Also
   the book now includes a number of additional reviews and essays by
   Moorcock that he has produced since the original publication. And
   there is an introduction by China Miéville and an afterword by Jeff
   Vandermeer. All in all there is about 25-30% new material.

  <p> However, as I said, Moorcocks views have not needed much updating. The
   scourges of formula fantasy and comfort reading that he railed against
   back in the 80s have, if anything, got worse since that time. There
   must be an audience for this stuff, but that audience (and the writers
   that serve them) are not exactly well thought of by Moorcock.
          ________________________________________________________

   <p>It is probably no coincidence that the majority of writers best known
   as fantasists, at least until the present couple of generations, were
   introverted, reclusive, misanthropic, or that a strong vein of
   misogynism built itself into the conventions of the genre over the
   years, so that women were unbelievably beautiful goddesses,
   treacherous jades, or silly slave girls. Much fantasy was
   characteristically bachelor-fiction written and read by that section
   of the community.
          ________________________________________________________

   <p>And if you think that is rude, you should see what he has to say about
   John Norman. (Although actually the short section out of a Gor book
   that he quotes condemns Norman far more effectively that anything any
   critic might say.)

   <p>Although he is famous for writing sword & sorcery novels, Moorcock has
   always tried to undermine the genre, and has little time for those who
   glory in its violence.
          ________________________________________________________

  <p> Some years ago, as a guest of a fantasy convention, I appeared on a
   panel with a group of sword-and-sorcery writers who told the audience
   that the reason they wrote such fantasy was because they (and, they
   implied, the audience) felt inadequate to cope with the complexities
   of modern life. "Where today?" asked one, "can you put an arm hold
   around a mans throat and slip a knife into him between the third and
   fourth ribs and get away with it?" The answer was, of course, that the
   Marines were still looking for recruits. Bu maybe he meant, "Where can
   you do that and not have someone retaliate?" If thats the main appeal
   of such stories it probably explains why most people over the age of
   eighteen stop reading them.
          ________________________________________________________

  <p> Yet while he might come down heavily on the misogyny and violence of
   the sword and sorcery end of the genre, Moorcock is equally
   contemptuous of works that seek to provide comfort and cuteness. Be ye
   seated, good people, and listen awhile, while ye good sage Michael
   doth make merry with ye olde fashion for High Fantasy.
          ________________________________________________________

  <p> Most of the current attempts at this sort of "high" English are pretty
   pathetic, reminiscent of children trying to write historical stories
   by peppering the text with phrases like "shiver me timbers." They
   borrow largely from Tolkien as usual and produce from his original
   porridge a gruel increasingly thin and lumpy. [] They are moulded from
   the basest of metals. They are like mass-produced ikons. They are the
   literary equivalents of the painted plaster saints and statuettes of
   Christ found in any Lourdes supermarket, or like those toys produced
   in their thousands in China and Russia. They are actually made by
   individuals, but there is virtually no evidence for this.
          ________________________________________________________

  <p> As for Tolkien himself, I think that Moorcock is being a little unfair
   when he says that The Lord of the Rings is entirely without humor.
   (Either that or Peter Jackson & Co did a much better job with the text
   than I had thought.) But there is no doubt that Moorcock has some
   cogent criticisms of Tolkiens work.
          ________________________________________________________

  <p> It is moderation which ruins Tolkiens fantasy and causes it to fail as
   a genuine romance. The little hills and woods of that Surrey of the
   mind, the Shire, are "safe", but the wild landscapes everywhere beyond
   the Shire are "dangerous." Experience of life itself is dangerous. The
   Lord of the Rings is a pernicious confirmation of the values of a
   morally bankrupt middle class. The Lord of the Rings is much more
   deeply rooted in its infantilism than a good many of the more
   obviously juvenile books it influenced. It is Winnie-the-Pooh posing
   as an epic.
          ________________________________________________________

  <p> Ouch! I know what he means, but I can just see people sharpening their
   word processors already. Being rude about Tolkien is not exactly a
   safe practice these days. But if there is anyone with the authority to
   do it and get away with it then it is Moorcock. And to a large extent
   he is right. LotR is very much a product of the English middle classes
   as they existed 100 years or so ago. This comment, I think, makes the
   point rather better.
          ________________________________________________________

  <p> If the bulk of American sf could be said to be written by robots,
   about robots, for robots, then the bulk of English fantasy seems to be
   written by rabbits, about rabbits, for rabbits.
          ________________________________________________________

  <p> I wish I had written that. Then again, I wish I had written a lot of
   what Moorcock writes in Wizardry & Wild Romance. I also wish I had
   read even half as much as Moorcock has read of the genre, and knew
   half as much as he knows. (Although someone really should have told
   him that Magic: The Gathering is not, by any stretch of the
   imagination, a role-playing game.)

  <p> Here I have concentrated on the parts of the book in which Moorcock
   takes entertaining digs at parts of the genre he doesnt like. But
   there are huge swathes of the book that are simply a fascinating tour
   through the history of epic fantasy that will leave you wanting to go
   out and buy the books he talks about.

  <p> So, three cheers once again for MonkeyBrain for giving this book a new
   lease of life. Anyone who wants to write cogently about fantasy, or
   even just read it intelligently, should have a copy of Wizardry & Wild
   Romance.

 

 <h>  Short Stuff
   
  <h> Faerie Magic

  <p> From my point of view, one of the best things about running the Hugo
   Recommendation List is that I get to find out which short stories are
   likely to get nominated without having to wade through the vast
   quantity of short fiction out there. A story that has been getting a
   lot of attention is Jeffrey Fords "The Annals of Eelin-Ok", from a YA
   collection called The Faery Reel. Ellen Datlow and Terri Windling are
   the editors, Sharyn November is the editor at Viking responsible for
   the book, and Charles Vess did the cover. There are stories by,
   amongst others, Kelly Link, Patricia McKillip, Greg Frost, Gregory
   Maguire, Delia Sherman, Charles De Lint, Emma Bull need I go on?

  <p> Utterly shamelessly, I emailed Jeff, and he sent me a copy of the
   story. "The Annals of Eelin-Ok" is a beautiful novelette about the
   Twilmish, a species of Faery that lives and dies solely for the
   purpose of inhabiting sandcastles. OK, so it is very soppy. But it is
   also very wonderful. If enough people get to read it Im sure this one
   will be on the final ballot.

  <p> Sharyn is kindly sending me a copy of the book. Expect a review of the
   whole thing next issue.
          ________________________________________________________

  <h> Rum in Ruritania

  <p> Kim Newman has a Sherlock Holmes story on the BBC Cult web site. Well
   actually it is a Moriarty story. Holmes doesnt feature. Various
   persons from Ruritania do. And one from New Jersey. Very funny.

   <p>The web site has several other Holmes stories by different writers.
   One is by Jon Courtenay Grimwood and is perhaps is little
   controversial.

  

  <h> Out of Synch

  <p> Somewhat to my surprise, Del Rey has picked up The Meq by Steve Cash
   (Emcit #93), originally a Pan Macmillan book. Good luck to you, Mr.
   Cash.

  <p> Tor is releasing the second of Steven Eriksons Malazan Empire books,
   Deadhouse Gates, on the unsuspecting American public. Still, hopefully
   lots of them will have read Gardens of the Moon by now and will have
   some idea what to expect. Hopefully Ill get a copy of Deadhouse Gates
   in time for the next issue.

  <p> But the star event of February in the US has to be the release of
   Steph Swainstons The Year of Our War (Emcit #103). Congratulations to
   HarperCollins for having the sense to snap it up for the US market. As
   you may have noticed, it is one of my top ten fantasy books of 2004.
   Go buy.

          ________________________________________________________

  <h> Indian SF Conference

  <p> The 2004 conference of the Indian Association for Science Fiction
   Studies took place in Pondicherry University on the 18^th and 19^th of
   December. Dr Srinarahari, the General Secretary, has sent me a report
   of proceedings, which Ill summarize here.

  <p> Firstly I am pleased to note that several other Western magazines and
   organizations have taken an interest in Indian SF besides Locus and
   Emerald City. A pat on the back is due to Jonathan Cowie at
   Concatenation, to Infinite Matrix, and to Andy Sawyer at Liverpool
   University.

  <p> In recognition of our interest, the folks in India are making an
   effort to make their work available to us. One of the announcements at
   the conference was of a 500-rupee prize for the best English
   translation of a Tamil language novel, Alexandarum Oru Koppai
   Theenirum (Alexander over a cup of tea) by M.G. Suresh. The idea was
   so warmly received that contributions from delegates raised the prize
   to 2,500 rupees.

  <p> The academic sessions at the conference covered a wide range of
   topics, including AI and Robotics, the relationship of SF to
   mainstream fiction, Magic Realism, and nanotechnology. This was also
   the first year in which there was sufficient interest for the
   conference to cover fantasy as well as SF.

  <p> Some kind person encouraged delegates to attend Interaction. I dont
   know who it was, but we are very grateful. We would love to see more
   Indian visitors to Worldcon.

  <p> But we also have to come down to Earth occasionally. I dont know how
   many of you know where in India Pondicherry is located, but the
   mention of stories in Tamil might have given you a clue that it is
   somewhere in the state of Tamilnadu and therefore close to another
   famous home of Tamil people, Sri Lanka.

  <p> Exactly a week after the conference took place, the guesthouse where
   the delegates stayed was flatted by a certain tsunami. Thankfully all
   of the attendees were home safe by that time. The world SF community
   has been very lucky.

  <p> Next years conference is in Mysore on December 9-11. I very much doubt
   that I will be able to attend, but I do hope that someone from the
   West will go.
          ________________________________________________________

  <h> Phil Dick Award Nominees

  <p> This years list of nominees for the Philip K. Dick Award has been
   announced. The lucky books are as follows:

  <p> The Coyote Kings of the Space-Age Bachelor Pad, Minister Faust (Del
   Rey); Stable Strategies and Others, Eileen Gunn (Tachyon
   Publications); Life, Gwyneth Jones (Aqueduct Press); Apocalypse Array,
   Lyda Morehouse (Roc); Air, Geoff Ryman (St. Martins Griffin); City of
   Pearl, Karen Traviss (Eos); Banner of Souls, Liz Williams (Bantam
   Spectra).

  <p> This is an incredibly strong list. As you will see, I have reviewed
   all but one of them, and I liked them all. Four of them have made my
   Best of 2004 list in one way or another, and the other two were very
   close. If I were a judge I think I would want to give the award to
   Geoff Ryman, but I foresee some very robust discussion amongst the
   judging panel because these are all very deserving works.

  <p> Must get a copy of the Minister Faust book. Ive just looked it up on
   Amazon and it sounds very, very strange indeed.

  <p> As usual the winner will be announced at Norwescon, which takes place
   in Seattle over the Easter weekend.
          ________________________________________________________

  <h> Fannish Reading Survey

   <p>Farah Mendlesohn is conducting a survey of fannish reading habits when
   we were young. The questionnaire is here. Please take a look. The more
   people who fill it in the better the results will be.

  <h> Interaction Programme Participants

  <p> It has become clear to me in doing PR for Interaction that many people
   in UK fandom have no idea what Worldcons are like. I have lost count
   of the number of times that people have said or written, "Ive never
   heard of any of their guests, so there is no point in going." First of
   all it is hugely depressing that there are people out there who have
   never heard of Chris Priest, Robert Sheckley and Jane Yolen. They need
   to go just to find out. But the important point is that this is not
   some tiny local convention where the only authors present are the
   guests. This is Worldcon. Authors are everywhere.

  <p> So one of the things we are doing is making a point of announcing all
   of the authors who have agreed to be on panel (or at least do a
   signing). Well be making regular press releases about this. Probably
   one a month. Here is the first batch.

  <p> Brian Aldiss, Ellen Asher, Stephen Baxter, Jonathan Clements, John
   Clute, Jon Courtenay Grimwood, Ellen Datlow, Cory Doctorow, Scott
   Edelman, Esther Friesner, David Gerrold, Joe Haldeman, Peter Hamilton,
   Elizabeth Hand, David A. Hardy, Harry Harrison, John-Henri Holmberg,
   Geoffrey Landis, Miller Lau, Rebecca Moesta, Larry Niven, Sharyn
   November, Jody Lynn Nye, Terry Pratchett, Mike Resnick, Kim Stanley
   Robinson, Justina Robson, Frank Roger, Stanley Schmidt, Robert
   Silverberg, Charles Stross, Karen Traviss, Gordon Van Gelder, Liz
   Williams.

  <p> Now tell me, what other UK convention (other than previous Worldcons)
   has ever had a guest list like that? And that is only the start. There
   will be lots more.

  <h> Footnote

  <p> Coming up next issue we have novels from Ian R. MacLeod, Richard
   Morgan, Steven Erikson and Glenda Larke. We have the Leviathan #4
   anthology and The Faery Reel. Sunday Times science columnist Bryan
   Appleyard explains why people are so keen to believe in aliens. And I
   will try to comment sensibly about Hugo nominations.

  <p> And in amongst all that I get to go to Glasgow for an Interaction
   staff meeting, go back to California, and make a business trip to
   Korea. Life is not dull.

  <p> Ciao,

  <p> Love n hugs,

  <p> Cheryl
