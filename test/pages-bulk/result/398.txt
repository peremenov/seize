  <p> Q: What is the fastest running dinasour
   from alex t, houston, tx, ?; August 29, 2000

  <p> A: No one knows for sure. The fastest runners were probably the
   bird-like meat-eaters (long-legged, lightly-built theropods), like
   Gallimimus, Ornithomimus, and Coelophysis.

  <p> Q: What is the definition of bird-hipped?
   from ?, ?, ?, ?; August 29, 2000

  <p> A: Dinosaurs are divided into two groups based on hip structure, the
   Order Ornithischia (bird-hipped) and the Order Saurischia
   (lizard-hipped).

  <p> The Ornithischian dinosaurs were plant-eaters that had a hip structure
   similar to that of birds, but they were not the ancestors of birds.
   The pubis bone (part of the structure of the hip) points downwards and
   to the front in the Saurischians and points downwards and toward the
   tail in Ornithischians. The Ornithischian pelvis is wider than the
   Saurischian pelvis. This may have made Ornithischians more stable
   while moving. Ornithischian skulls also had small, reduced openings
   (antorbital fenestrae) between the eye socket and the nares
   (nostrils), unlike saurischians.

  <p> Q: have they ever found dinasaur fossils in Jacksonville, Florida or
   anywhere in Florida?
   from shane h, jacksonville, fl, usa; August 29, 2000

  <p> A: No, because Florida was underwater during the time of the
   dinosaurs. The climate was warmer then, so there was no polar ice.
   This made the sea levels higher than they are today, and Florida was
   part of a shallow sea.

  <p> Q: What name is given to our climate in Bakersfield
   from moxy d., bakersfield, california, u.s.a.; August 28, 2000

  <p> A: A high-altitude desert.

  <p> Q: On which continent have the most dinosaur bones been found; second;
   third; etc?
   from Anthony s, Duvall, WA, USA; August 27, 2000

  <p> A: The most dinosaur fossils have been found in Asia and North America
   (roughly equal), Europe, Africa, South America, and then Australia.
   The fewest number have been found in Antarctica. This list doesn't
   necessarily reflect the relative abundance of dinosaurs; it mosty
   reflects the places that paleontologists have looked the most. For a
   list of dinosaur fossils found by continent, click here.

  <p> Q: Do you have any pictures of a megadon?
   from ?, ?, ?, ?; August 27, 2000

  <p> A: Megalodon probably looked like a huge Great White Shark that was
   more streamlined. For more infromation on Megalodon, clicke here.

  <p> Q: I AM LOOKING FOR ANY INFORMATION ON A DINASAUR FROM THE JARRASIC
   PEROID IN FRANCH THE SPELLING I have for this dinosaur is
   dactylotheuthis, I am not sure if this is the propper spelling. If you
   have any information on this dinosaur or on it's teeth, anything close
   to this spelling would be helpful
   from sh, sanat barbara, california, usa; August 25, 2000

  <p> A: I've never heard of Dactylotheuthis. For a list of the known
   dinosaur genera, click here.

  <p> Q: Which dinosaur had the largest feet and how big were they?
   from Michele, Uxbridge, MA, ?; August 25, 2000

  <p> A: The huge Jurassic period sauropods had the biggest feet, leaving
   footprints the size of a bathtub.
     _________________________________________________________________

  <p> Q: What was the smartest dionsaur?
   from Cody, Fort Worth, Texas, North America; August 25, 2000

  <p> A: The smartest dinosaurs (the ones with the largest brain to body
   mass ratio) were the troodontids (like Tro√∂don).

  <p> Q: This barely has anything to do with dinosaurs, but I really want to
   know why can't mammals be green?
   from Brad, Woodville, ON, Canada; August 25, 2000

  <p> A: I have no idea, but that's a great question. Green is a wonderful
   camouflage color, and you'd think it would be rather common, at least
   in small mammals. The three-toed sloth does appear green, but the
   green color is due to algae colonies that live on its brown fur. The
   Green Ringtail Possum looks almost green (its fur is a mixture of
   black, grey, yellow, and white hairs).

  <p> Q: What is the size of the brain of a dinosaur?
   from Adam S., Canton, Oh., USA; August 24, 2000

  <p> A: It varied quite a lot. Stegosaurus had a brain about the size of a
   walnut, and the huge Giganotosaurus had a brain the size of a banana.
     _________________________________________________________________

  <p> Q: I have a Dinosaur toy that has its name on it but I can't read the
   first initial. Can you help? the remaining letters are:- LOPHOSAURUS
   by the look of it it would walk on its hind legs, has a frill around
   its neck and a hood on its head thank you for you time
   from Jan M, LEETON, NSW, AUSTRALIA; August 24, 2000

  <p> A: That's Dilophosaurus. For information on Dilophosaurus, click here.
   Q: What during age did dinosaurs first appear?
   from saerom park, mt.roskill, ?, ?; August 23, 2000

  <p> A: Dinosaurs evolved about 230 million years ago, during the Ladinian
   Age of the mid-Triassic period (towards the beginning of the Mesozoic
   Era).
     _________________________________________________________________

  <p> Q: How could I obtain a copy of Predatory Dinosaurs of the World, by
   Gregory Paul? I've seen it mentioned quite a bit on some websites I've
   been reading lately, and many very cool and unique theories are
   supposedly presented in it. But it is out of print! And chance of a
   new edition ever coming out? Any way to get it if there isn't? At any
   price.
   from Brad, Woodville, ON, Canada; August 23, 2000

  <p> A: You could probably check it out at your local library (I just check
   my library, which has 11 copies). I don't know about a new edition.
     _________________________________________________________________

  <p> Q: How come micro-organisms didn't decompose dinosaur bones?
   from Caillin P, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; August 23, 2000

 <p>  A: Most dead animals are eaten or destroyed soon after death. Only a
   small number of organisms fossilize. These select few were quickly
   buried after their death (by sinking in mud, being buried in a sand
   storm, etc.) and were in conditions that did not favor decomposition
   (for example: low-oxygen water, very dry conditions, etc.).
     _________________________________________________________________

  <p> Q: Which was bigger the Diplodocus or the Triceratops?
   from Tammy A, Oromocto, New Brunswick, Canada; August 22, 2000

  <p> A: Diplodocus was longer and heavier. Diplodocus was about 90 feet (27
   m) long and weighed roughly 10-20 tons; Triceratops was about 30 feet
   (9 m) long and weighed roughly 6-12 tons.

 <p>  Q: Witch lived on Earth first Dinosaurs or cockroches?
   from Stephanie B., Acton, Ontario, Canada; August 22, 2000

  <p> A: Cockroaches similar to modern-day species are found in upper
   Carboniferous rock, roughly 300 million years old. Dinosaurs evolved
   much later, about 230 million years ago, during the Triassic period.

  <p> Q: What does EQ mean?
   from justin wicks, mackay, Queensland, australia; August 21, 2000

  <p> A: EQ stands for encephalization quotient. It is a ratio of the mass
   of an animal's brain to the mass of its body. This helps determine the
   relative intelligence of extinct animals. For more information, click
   here.

  <p> Q: Was Megaladon the largest shark ever found , besides the whale
   shark?
   from Tiffany P, Germantown, Maryland, America; August 21, 2000

  <p> A: No one knows exactly how long Megalodon was - it is estimated to
   have been anywhere from 40 to perhaps even 100 ft long (a minority
   opinion). The largest sharks today are the whale shark (50 feet long)
   and the basking shark (40 feet long). For more information on
   Megalodon, click here.
     _________________________________________________________________

 <p> Q: What is the Largest
   Butterfly?
   from George H, Houston, Tx, ?; August 20, 2000

  <p> A: The Queen Alexandra's Birdwing, which has a wingspan of about a
   foot. For more information on the Queen Alexandra's Birdwing, click
   here.

  <p> Q: What other things became extinct when dinasaurs did? How do we
   know? Who found this evidence?
   from Viv, ?, ?, ?; August 20, 2000

 <p>  A: Many other organisms, like pterosaurs, plesiosaurs, mosasaurs,
   ammonites, some families of birds and marsupial mammals, over half the
   plankton groups, many families of teleost (bony) fishes, bivalves,
   snails, sponges, sea urchins and others went extinct during the K-T
   extinction, 65 million years ago.

  <p> Determining when an organism went exticnt is tricky because it
   involves NOT finding fossils of that organism after a certain point.
   The evidence comes from hundreds of paleontologists and geologists who
   find, identify, and date fossils.
     _________________________________________________________________

  <p> Q: Hi, I really need to ask you a question, quick because I have a
   project due tommorow and there is one thing that I`m stuck on... How
   did the Ichthyosaurs survive evolution, PLEASE ANSWER SOON!!!! Thanks
   sooooo Much JADE
   from Jade L, Durban, South Africa, ?, ?; August 20, 2000

 <p>  A: Evolution is a process in which the gene pool of a population
   gradually changes in response to environmental pressures, natural
   selection, and genetic mutations. Organisms don't survive evolution;
   they are molded by its forces (natural selection, etc.) or if they are
   unable to adapt quickly enough, they die out.

  <p> Ichthyosaurs evolved during the Triassic period, reached their peak
   during the Jurassic period, and disappeared during the Cretaceous
   period, about 95 million years ago. For more information on
   Ichthyosaurs, click here

  <p> Q: A small red (wine, actually) bird was seen in our neighborhood. It
   has a very bright orange beak. It's about the size of a robin, has a
   grayish head, and wine colored wings. What could it be?
   from Jean L, Kingsport, TN, USA; August 19, 2000

  <p> A: It sounds like it could be a femal cardinal. They are mostly
   gray-buff with red wine colored wings and tail, a bright orange-to
   pink beak (it is a short, wide bill), and a pale gray-red feather
   crest on the head.
     _________________________________________________________________

 <p>  Q: Becasuse saurouds had such long necks the blood flow would have to
   be tremendos to reach the brain! Does that mean when it lowered it's
   head to ground level the blood flow would shoot the head off?!
   from Jonathan L, Wirral, ?, England; August 19, 2000

 <p>  A: That would explain why most of the skullls are
   missing (no, no, that's just a joke).

  <p> Seriously, the sauropods must have had tremendously high blood
   pressure in order to get blood up to the brain, but paleontologists
   think that their arteries may have a series of valves (like we have in
   our veins) that kept the blood from going backwards down the neck, and
   keeping the pressure even along the length of the neck regardless of
   position (head up or head down).
     _________________________________________________________________

  <p> Q: Were oppossums around at the time of dinosaurs?? Is there a web
   page with this information?
   from Cortney W, HOT SPRINGS, Arkansas, USA; August 18, 2000

  <p> A: Yes, some early relatives of the opossum lived during the late
   Cretaceous period, towards the end of the time of the dinosaurs. An
   early relative of the opossums, Deltatheridium, an early marsupial,
   dates from about 80 million years ago (about 15 million years before
   the dinosaurs went extinct).
     _________________________________________________________________

  <p> Q: Which dinosaur is bigger the Stegoceras or the Stygimoloch?
   from Alic, ?, ?, ?; August 18, 2000

  <p> A: The pachycephalosaurids Stegoceras and the Stygimoloch were about
   the same size, about 7 feet (2 m) long), weighing roughly170 pounds
   (78 kg), but only the skull of Stygimoloch has been found, so this is
   an estimate.
     _________________________________________________________________

  <p> Q: why do dinos migrate?
   from jim, qeuzon, metro manila, philippines; August 18, 2000

  <p> A: It isn't known definitively that any dinosaurs migrated, but some
   (like Edmontosaurus) may have migrated seasonally, to feed and
   reproduce in appropriate areas (the same reason that modern-day
   animals migrate).
     _________________________________________________________________

  <p> Q: What dinosaur has pebbly skin and a toothless, spoon-shaped beak
   that is perfect for eating plants? Its long crest on top of its head
   slotes backwards and it likes to travel in herds.
   from Tim C., Fayetteville, NC, USA; August 17, 2000

  <p> A: That sounds like Parasaurolophus.
     _________________________________________________________________

  <p> Q: What dinosaur lived 65 million years ago
   from jordan o, perth, Willetton, wa; August 17, 2000

  <p> A: Some of the many dinosaurs that lived during the very late
   Cretaceous period included T. rex, Triceratops, Alioramus,
   Microceratops, Protoceratops, Anatotitan, Ankylosaurus, Edmontosaurus,
   Alamosaurus, and many others. For more late Cretceous dinosaurs, click
   here.
     _________________________________________________________________

 <p>  Q: We are doing dinosaurs at school,my question to answer is about
   extinction and the theories. I know about the K-T Theory but I have
   heard others like eating themselves to extinction, (running out of
   food), and the farting one. Do you know of any other possible
   theories. Thankyou
   from Rita P., Tauranga, Bay of Plenty, New Zealand; August 17, 2000

 <p>  Q: What is a megalodon
   from Tommy S, Brigeton, NJ, USA; August 15, 2000

  <p> A: Megalodon was a huge, ancient shark. For information on Megalodon,
   click here.
     _________________________________________________________________

  <p> Q: what is a cynadont?
   from Geoff.A, Bathurst, N.S.W, Australia; August 15, 2000

 <p>  A: Cynodonts are extinct animals that had had multi-cusped post-canine
   teeth (they had many points). Some ate meat, others were herbivores.
   They lived from the Permian period (before the dinosaurs evolved)
   until the late Triassic period (when the dinosaurs were just beginning
   to appear). Cynodonts (synapsids) led to the true mammals. Cynodont
   means "dog teeth", since their teeth looked like those of dogs.
     _________________________________________________________________

  <p> Q: What does the T stand for in T-Rex?
   from Amanda A, Millstone, WV, USA; August 15, 2000

  <p> Q: what is the extinct cousin of the great white shark
   from michael k, frostproof, florida, u.s.a; August 14, 2000

  <p> A: Megalodon.
     _________________________________________________________________

 <p>  Q: Which came first in the evolutionary ladder - shark or cock roach?
   from Shawn L., Kingsford, MI, USA; August 12, 2000

  <p> A: Cockroaches similar to modern-day species are found in upper
   Carboniferous rock, roughly 300 million years old. Sharks evolved
   earlier, during the Devoninan, over 350 million years ago.
     _________________________________________________________________

  <p> Q: What is Thescelosaurus's nick name?
   from Tara Kairupan, Shepparton, Victoria, Australia; August 12, 2000

  <p> A: I can't answer this question because it's current question on the
   CyberSafari quiz, but to get the answer, click here and read the page.
     _________________________________________________________________

  <p> Q: I seem to remember, when I was a kid, studying learning about a
   Dinosaur whose brain was in his tail? Is that correct or am I going to
   lose this bet?
   from Kim E, San Diego, CA, USA; August 11, 2000

  <p> A: You're right; scientists used to think that some dinosaurs (like
   Stegosaurus and the sauropods) had a second brain at the base of the
   tail. They no longer think that this is true, however.
     _________________________________________________________________

  <p> Q: When did the dinosaurs live?
   from D.T, Missippi, Mocomb, Texas; August 11, 2000

  <p> A: The dinosaurs lived during most of the Mesozoic Era. They evolved
   about 230 million years ago and went extinct 65 million years ago.
     _________________________________________________________________

  <p> Q: What was the dinosaurs habitat and climate?
   from Lindsey R, Fort Worth, TX, USA; August 11, 2000

  <p> A: It varied tremendously for different dinosaurs. Some lived in hot,
   desert-like areas, some lived in lush forests, others lived in
   relatively cold places.
     _________________________________________________________________

  <p> Q: how much does the mussaurus weigh?
   from wendy s., fortworth, texas, u.s.a.; August 11, 2000

  <p> A: As an adult, Mussaurus was perhaps up to 10 feet long (3 m),
   weighing roughly 260 pounds (120 kg). For more information on
   Mussaurus, click here.

  <p> Q: was there any dinosaur bones found in ohio.if so where and when
   from john g., cleveland, ohio, united states; August 10, 2000

  <p> A: No dinosaur fossils have been found in Ohio. For a list of
   dinosaurs fossil finds, listed state by state, click here.
     _________________________________________________________________

  <p> Q: Why are the older dinosaur names usually given by one person, but
   the new dinosaurs are named by many people?
   from Brad, Woodville, ON, Canada; August 10, 2000

  <p> A: That's a really good question. I've never seen heard any discussion
   of this, but my guess would be that long ago, there were also many
   people involved in finding fossils, but only the top guy got any
   credit. When you read about some of the early "dinosaur hunters" and
   their famous feuds and bullying episodes, you can bet that they gave
   little credit to their less-famous co-workers. It's hard to believe
   that these men found so many new genera single-handedly. Perhaps the
   world has become more egalitarian and a bit fairer.
     _________________________________________________________________

  <p> Q: How many years ago did they die
   from ?, ?, ?, ?; August 9, 2000

  <p> A: Most evidence points to the dinosaurs going extinct 65 million
   yeasr ago. There is one new controvertial find that seems in indicate
   a few survivors into the Tertiary period.
     _________________________________________________________________

  <p> Q: I heard that scientists in Japan were either in the prosses of or
   are attempting to bring back the wooly mamoth by using a frozen
   mamoths sperm or egg and combining it with a regular
   elephant....exactly what further information can you give me on this
   and when do we'the public' we expect to see this resurrected
   paccaderm?
   from jennifer w., midwaycity, california, united states; August 7,
   2000

  <p> A: Japanese and Russian scientists (K. Goto, A. Iritani, and S. Zimov)
   are trying to combine woolly mammoth genetic material (from the
   23,000-year-old Jarkov mammoth recently found frozen in Siberian
   permafrost) with that of a modern-day elephant. They will try to
   inject a cell nucleus of the mammoth into a living elephant cell in
   order to produce a viable embryo in a living female elephant, and
   eventually produce a new animal that is part-mammoth, part-elephant.
   This could be done again and again using the new organisms, getting
   closer to a pure mammoth offspring. The first problem is finding
   viable genetic material from the mammoth.

 <p>  Q: How big is Brachiosaurus heart ?.
   from Sarah M ., Auckland, ?, New-Zealand; August 7, 2000

  <p> A: No fossilized Brachiosaurus hearts have been found, but it must
   have been large and powerful in order to pump blood up the long neck
   to its head. For more information on Brachiosaurus, click here.

  <p> Q: Hi could i please have as much information as posible on the
   breeding of Brachiosaurus. Did brachiosaurus stay withun a heard,did
   it nurtreits young,did Brachiosaurus have any nests our eggs and what
   did Earths continents look like during Brachiosauruses time.
   from Josan Biggins, Adilaide, ?, South Australia; August 7, 2000

  <p> A: Brachiosaurus probably hatched from enormous eggs. It
   is not known if it cared for its young or build nests. That's about
   all that is known about its breeding. It may have lived in herds, but
   it is far from certain. For information on Brachiosaurus, click here.

  <p> Q: How long do you have to go to school to become a paleontologist?
   from raptor h., chandler, az, ?; August 5, 2000

  <p> A: You'll need an undergraduate degree (which usually takes four
   years) plus a graduate degree (usually a Ph.D., which takes 4 or more
   years). For more information on becoming a paleontologist, click here.

 <p>  Q: What is the name of the dinosaur that as the sort of hamer on the
   back of it's head?
   from ?, ?, ?, ?; August 3, 2000

  <p> A: It could be the meat-eating dinosaur called Cryolophosaurus, which
   had a horn-like, upward pointing crest above its eyes (it was named by

  <p> Q: are some dinoaurs still alive like unknown and in rivers and things
   like that?
   from megan, oklahoma city, oklahoma, usa.; August 3, 2000

  <p> A: It's unlikely.

  <p> Q: What is bipedal?
   from Amel S, Oxon Hill, MD, Fenwood; August 3, 2000

  <p> A: Bipedal (which means two feet) refers to an animal that walks on
   two legs. For example, people and T. rex are bipedal.

  <p> Q: Is it true that most of the dinosaurs were wiped out by a metorite?
   from Dean m, hainult, ?, England; August 3, 2000

  <p> A: The most accepted theory (the Alvarez Asteroid Theory) is that an
   asteroid (or a series of asteroids) hit the Earth, triggering
   catastrophic climate changes, which caused many organisms to go
   extinct.

  <p> Q: I know this is a lot, but any answers you can give me will be very
   helpful to my project. :) I need to know when (which period) the
   following first evolved and if and when it flourished: 1)weeping
   willow 2)trees like oak or maple 3)common shrubs 4)ground flowers,
   preferably roses, if they are even called ground flowers :P 5)palm
   trees 6)fruit-bearing trees 7)kiwis, the bird not the fruit :)
   8)cobras or any snake really 9)I don't know what they are called, LOL,
   but those large ice age birds that kinda resembled an ostrich in body
   plan; long, strong legs, little wings, and it's flightless... Thanks
   so much for your help! :)
   from Lyssi, Victoria, Texas, USA; August 2, 2000

  <p> A: 9. Dinornis was a huge, long-legged, flightless bird that lived
   from the Pleistocene until about 200 years ago.

  <p> 8. The earliest-known snakes date from the early Cretaceous period,
   about 130 million years ago (they probably evolved from lizards).

  <p> 7. The oldest-known kiwi fossil is only 1 million years old, but the
   kiwi is thought to be quite a bit older than this.

  <p> 6. Flowering plants evolved during the early Cretaceous period.
   Modern-day fruit-bearing tree evolved quite a while after this (during
   the Eocene, roughly 45 million years ago).

  <p> 5. Palm trees are flowering plants and monocots, and evolved during
   the Cretaceous period.

  <p> 4. Roses are flowering plants (angiosperms) and dicots, and their
   ancestors evolved during the late Cretaceous period, (97.5 to 66.4
   million years ago).

  <p> 3. Different shrubs evolved at different times. The flowering shrubs
   evolved much later (from the early Cretaceous period) than the
   non-flowering shrubs (like juniper).

  <p> 2. Different trees evolved at different times. Oaks and maples are
   flowering plants (angiosperms) whose ancestors first appeared during
   the middle Cretaceous period. Some trees, like conifers, are much more
   ancient

  <p> 1. I can't find when the modern-day weeping willow evolved, but it is
   closely related to magnolias, which evolved during the Cretaceous
   period.

  <p> Q: Uh, I don't know what exactly I'm looking for this time. LOL I just
   need information on ice age tar pits. Things like what causes them,
   where they occur (geologically and geographically :)), what they
   looked like, what happened to the victims... etc. would be great! If
   there is anything else about tar pits that is important or just fun
   and interesting:) please tell me that too. :) Thanks again! :)
   from Lyssi, Victoria, Texas, USA; August 2, 2000

  <p> A: A tar pit is a pool of gooey asphalt. It is created when crude oil
   seeps up from deep inside the Earth through a crack, called a fissure.
   The less dense elements of the crude oil evaporate, leaving asphalt (a
   very sticky mess). Water pooled on the tar, attracting thirsty
   animals. As an animal gets stuck in the tar, it probably attract
   predators. The animals' bones, teeth, and other hard parts are
   well-preserved in this environment (but they turn brown from the
   asphalt).

  <p> Tar pits are located around the world. A famous tar pit is the Rancho
   La Brea Tar Pit (in southern California, USA). The oldest organism (a
   wood fragment) found in the La Brea Tar Pit is from 40,000 years ago.

  <p> Q: Where have the fossilized remains of water-dwelling 'dinosaurs'
   such as plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs been located ?
   from Karen S., Gowrie Junction, Queensland, Australia; August 2, 2000

  <p> A: Plesiosaurs have been found in England, Germany, France, Japan,
   Kansas (USA), Queensland (Australia), parts of the former USSR, and
   other localities that were covered by a shallow sea during the
   MesozoicEra. Ichthyosaurs have been found in Nevada, Alaska, (USA),
   Alberta (Canada), the Canadian Arctic, China, Timor, the Alps,
   Spitsbergen, Greenland, Argentina, England, Germany, and other ancient
   sea bed areas.

  <p> Q: My four year old daughter wants to know what was alive before there
   were dinasaurs. i thought maybe birds and fish, but i really don't
   know. she would be tickled to see her answer here. thanks a lot
   from natalie t, riverview, mi, usa; August 2, 2000

  <p> A: There were lots of animals that lived before the dinosaurs,
   including many reptiles, fish (including sharks), amphibians (like
   frogs), corals, sponges, insects (like cockroaches and beetles), shell
   fish, and many others. Mammals evoloved about the same time as the
   dinosaurs.

 <p>  Q: Where are fossils found
   from sheila sgp, San Bernardino, California, United States; August 2,
   2000

  <p> A: FOssils have been found all over the world (on every continent),
   usually in exposed sedimentary rock (especially in areas like
   badlands).
     _________________________________________________________________

  <p> Q: I read in the paper that a shark tooth of Cretodus crassidems Would
   you give me a info sheet if you have one Thanks.
   from Samuel C., Columbus, Georgia, U.S.A; August 2, 2000

 <p>  A: Cretodus is an extinct genus of Mackerel sharks that lived during
   the late Cretaceous period. This shark is known only from fossilized
   teeth and vertebrae that have been found in Africa, Europe, and North
   America. The length of the teeth (from the tip of the crown to the tip
   of the root) is about inches (5 cm). Cretodus was named by Sokolov in
   1965. Classification: Order Lamniformes, Family Cretoxyrhinidae.

 <p>  Q: Which oceans did the Ichthyosaurus live in?
   from Rebi N, Cairns, Queensland, Australia; August 2, 2000

  <p> A: Ichthyosaurus lived in shallow seas that covered what is now
   England, Germany, Greenland, and Alberta (Canada). During the early
   Jurassic period until the early Cretaceous period, roughly 206 to 140
   million years ago, when Ichthyosaurus lived, these areas of Europe and
   North America were covered by many shallow seas (these shallow seas
   existed becasue the sea level was higher during his time, since there
   was no polar ice.

  <p> Q: how many brains do they have
   from Tamara pritchard, Alexandra, Otago, New zealand; August 1, 2000

  <p> A: One per dinosaur. It used to be thought that some of the larger
   dinosaurs (like Stegosaurus and the giant sauropods) had a second
   brain at the base of the tail. This is no longer believed to be true.
     _________________________________________________________________

  <p> Q: What type of prehistoric animals were found in Florida or Ohio?
   from Eric V., Keystone Heights, Florida, USA; August 1, 2000

  <p> A: Florida was underwater for a lot of Earth's history (including
   during the Mesozoic Era, the time of the dinosaurs). It has been home
   to millions of marine organisms (like teeth of Carcharodon the ancient
   shark, other fish, porpoises and whales, seacows, shells, other
   invertebrates, etc.), and later land animals like Mammuthus columbi,
   Cuvieronius (a gomphothere ), bears, horses, camels, protoceratids,
   rhinos, dogs, amphicyons, oreodonts, lizards, turtles, snakes,
   alligators, amphibians, birds, bats, etc.

  <p> Ohio was also under the sea for a long time. Fossils from Ohio include
   trilobites, nautiloid cephalopod, bryozoans, horn corals, gastropods,
   brachiopods, crinoids, pelecypods, Cladoselache (an early shark),
   Dunkleosteus, lungfish, and many other fish, mastodons, horses, and
   others. For a good page on Ohio fossils, click here.

   <p>Q: WHAT IS THE LARGEST DINOSAURS EGG?
   from Jessie L., Blountville, Tn., USA; August 1, 2000

  <p> A: The first fossilized dinosaur eggs (and the biggest yet to be
   found) were football-shaped Hypselosaurus eggs found in France in
   1869. For more information on dinosaurs eggs, click here.

 <p>  Q: what are the three main theories on the dinasaurs extinction
   from ?, ?, ?, ?; August 1, 2000

 <p> A: The Alvarez asteroid theory is the most widely accepted theory. For
   other dinosaur extinction theories, click here.
     _________________________________________________________________

  <p> Q: I've had that Safari model for years, and the colour scheme is
   really stuck in my head. But I don't want ot use it, because I think
   it could be plagarism. It is pretty unique. I've also seen it with
   zebra stripes, which is cool, but again its already taken. I might
   just make it sand-coloured. I've subscribed to the dinosaur mailing
   list and recieve tons of e-mail, but I'm not sure how to post stuff so
   it appears in the archives. Can you help me?
   from Brad, Woodville, ON, Canada; August 1, 2000

  <p> A: When you write to the list, your post will be put in the archives.
   For information on writing to the list (and other things you should
   know about the list), click here.
