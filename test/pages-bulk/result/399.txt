     _________________________________________________________________

   <p>Do not wear the emperor's clothes. Put on something alittle more
   modest.
   <h>CLOTHING GUIDELINES
   <p>What will you wear to Europe? This is a major concern, but it
   issecondary. The real question is -- how much? You are
   infinitelybetter off going with nothing but an umbrella and a
   toothbrush thanwith the load you would typically bring on a vacation
   in the UnitedStates.
   <h>Pack Light
   <p>As every traveler and chronicler of the subject relates,pack light.
   Seldom does anyone define the meaning of pack light,except to present
   a list of clothes and accessories to bring, nosuch list ever being
   universally practical. To enjoy travel, youmust pack light. To define
   pack light, travel with your chosen loadand see for yourself if it is
   convenient and gives you the freedomyou need.
   <h>Dress Sharp
   <p>It pays to be well presented, with a European flavor.Europeans are
   clothes conscious. Northern Europeans look somber,while brighter
   colors are more common as you go south. Clothesrepresent personality
   and social status. People weartheir better clothes almost all the
   time.
   <p>Europeans seeing you for the first time and only brieflywill judge you
   completely by your appearance, and will behaveaccordingly.
   Unfortunately for the traveler, most of your personalcontact in Europe
   will be with hotel clerks and cafe waiters. Tosecure a good room, good
   table, and good service, dress as if youdeserve it. In fact, you will
   be stopped at the door of many placesif you are not properly dressed.
   <h>Be Comfortable
   <p>In addition, you must keep yourself comfortable. NorthernEuropean
   weather is generally cooler, wetter, and more variablethan in the
   United States. South of the Alps and Pyrenees it can bewarm and stuffy
   just about any time of the year. Walking in and outof museums,
   restaurants, and stores may force you to off and onyour coat. In
   stores the heat from those little halogen lamps canbe very
   uncomfortable. Be ready for rain or shine, hot or cold.
   <h>Pack Light Field Test
   <p>I propose the following test, preferably taken in a lightrain.
   Pack everything, put on your hat and coat, open yourumbrella, (raining
   or not), check the time, and walk one mile awayfrom home with
   everything you have. Then, pretending you are tryingto catch a train
   or trying to get to the tourist office before itcloses, run or walk
   home. If you can make the round tripcomfortably within 45 minutes, you
   have packed light. It is best ifyour test course includes a short,
   steep hill or several flights ofstairs, upwards on the return leg.
   Also make sure that all of your traveling companions canpass the pack
   light field test. If not, old friends may becomelifetime enemies.
   Failure to obey the pack light rule will doom youin so many ways that
   you will be better off to stay home and wateryour tomatoes. Those
   taking a cruise or tour may think that theycan escape this rule, but
   be aware that porters and taxis areusually scarce and/or expensive.
   <h>RECOMMENDED CLOTHING
   <p>Rules for the easy traveler, then, are rather formidable:
   <l>1. Pack light
   <l>2. Dress sharp
   <l>3. Be comfortable
   <h>Typical Tourist Clothing
   <p>The clothes worn by most American tourists announce them asAmericans
   better than any trilingual poster ever could. From theground up you're
   wearing: jogger or tennis shoes, worn Levi's,collared tee shirt, and
   ski jacket, with a backpack. If you arepast the age of backpacks, your
   oversized plastic suitcase willeven more effectively identify you as
   an American.
   <h>Go Like a Local
   <p>For a number of reasons you are better off looking like alocal citizen
   rather than a standard American tourist. Don't misinterpret this. I
   love the USA and all that it represents, but I try to avoid being an
   American billboard when I travel overseas. The primary reason is to
   avoid being a target of pickpockets, a breed endemic in Europe. You
   might also think that it could avoid being caught up in terrorist
   bombings as London had in July 2005. That is probably not an issue
   since the murdering sons of bitches just kill anybody, including
   fellow Muslims praying at their local mosque.
   <p>For many years my personal preference was a pairof black slip-on
   shoes, wool/polyester blend slacks, turtleneckshirt, and sport coat.
   This ensemble will get you through almostany door in Europe with
   reasonable respect, keep you comfortableunder most weather conditions,
   and allow you to blend in withoutbeing instantly identified as "the
   American."
   <p>The wool/polyester blend slacks look more like wool thanplastic, but
   they wash drip dry. You won't need to iron theseif you care for them
   according to the label. Levi Strauss has introduced a new Dockers line
   available in several colors besides the normal khaki. A couple of
   pairs of the dark charcoal served me well throughout Europe on my
   January 2006 trip. Turtleneck shirts arenot common in America. In fact
   I couldn't find a single one in December 2005. The men's shops all
   said that they weren't in style this year. Booosh! You can find them
   inski clothing shops. If you are not in ski country get catalogs from
   Lands End and from L.L Bean for a good selection. I ended up buying a
   couple of good cotton T-necks at the V+D department store after I
   arrived in Holland. An open collar dress shirt is a good substitute
   for the turtleneck in warmer weather. In very few restaurants is a tie
   required, though you'll see them often in better establishments. For
   off-season travel, I also bring a lightweight turtleneck sweater. My
   sport coat has a herringbone pattern and travels very wellwithout
   showing wrinkles or minor stains.
   <h>Levi's
   <p>Levi's and other brands of denim jeans became fashionable inEurope in
   the 1990's. Levi's are now tolerated in many cafésand restaurants
   during the day. However, regular slacks are muchmore common as street
   wear in major cities throughout Europe. Based on my observations of
   people walking through the central train stations of Europe less than
   20% were wearing denim jeans. The preference for the vast majority,
   men and women, young and old, was black slacks.
   <p>Slacks are also much more in harmony with packing light. Levi's
   areheavy and bulky, and take a day to dry out when they get rained on.
   If you do wear denim, select a lightweight pair with a bit of fashion.
   You might want to consider wearing Levi slacks rather than Levi jeans.
   Levi Strauss makes a good looking line called "Action Slacks." These
   are 100% Dacron and travel very well. Wash them off in the shower at
   night and hang them to drip dry by morning. I have a couple pairs in
   black. I recently switched to another Levi Strauss product for my
   European travels and everyday wear. These are charcoal Dockers, 55%
   cotton and 45% MicroPolyester, style number 405189256. They are very
   comfortable and look like dress slacks.
   <p>When strolling in major cities in the summer a lightweight pair of
   black slacks or skirt plus a white top will serve you well. This is
   standard attire for a large percentage of the native populations, and
   tourists from other European countries.
   <p>I have no ambition of being a clothing cop so accept this chapter as
   you will. The advice is based on my personal experience in Europe.
   Yeah sure, you can wear your back yard jeans or shorts, t-shirt or no
   shirt, sneakers or flip flops, and that is the way you will be viewed
   and treated in the cosmopolitan cities throughout Europe. Expect no
   respect.
   <p>Dressing well does not have to apply only to Europe. I had drifted
   into wearing Levis at my local pub in Michigan a few years ago. One
   night last summer I was returning home from an event where I was
   wearing a jacket and slacks and decided to stop in at Oscar's, my
   regular place, to shoot some eight ball. It wasn't long before a young
   lady about half my age started bumping into me and making strong eye
   contact. After that I started wearing slacks and a dress shirt when I
   went to Oscar's. Approachments by young dames has happened again and
   again to the point that it has become embarrassing, but I won't brag
   on it. Guys, listen up here! Dress sharp and you won't need all those
   bull drop lines to meet a girl in Europe, or anywhere.
   <p>I would expect that a woman dressed in Levi's would normally be
   approached by a man in more or less the same low-life outfit. It's
   only speculation, but I guess that if you want to meet the prince of
   your dreams in Europe you would dress to the nines. Why not? Besides,
   women in Levi's are about the most asexual creatures on the earth. I
   don't know why girls wear Levis. They are so unflattering to the
   derrière. And it won't cost you much to dress better. It will probably
   cost you less than that name brand stuff. Think, have you been to your
   local second hand store recently. They have some great stuff at
   laughingly ridiculous low prices. You will want to tell your friends,
   as I have just done. Male speaking, I just bought a London Fog brand,
   zipper in liner,trench coat for $40. It looks better than the the one
   in my closet that I bought 15 years ago for $140. Well, I must admit
   that it is a bit out of fashion. Most coats in Europe are black and
   the length is just above the knee, so this thing is the wrong color
   and a foot too long per current styles.
   <h>Layers
   <p>Dress in "layers." This means dressing in items that can be added to
   orremoved individually without changing everything when the
   weatherchanges. For example, instead of a heavy overcoat wear a
   sweater and a windbreaker. If it gets too warm in the afternoon take
   off the sweater and carry it in a shopping bag. Dressing in layers
   requires that all of your clothes be complementaryand mixable. Dark,
   neutral, and earth colors tend to avoid fashionclashes, and do not
   need cleaning as often as lighter colors.
   <h>Shoes
   <p>In Europe you'll notice all sorts of footwear -- boots,clogs, tennis,
   joggers, sandals, army issue, and Italian fashion.Many people will see
   and examine your shoes before their eyes comeup to meet yours, if they
   ever do.
   <p>Appearance is important.Wear a good looking, durable, broken-in pair
   of shoes. Your averageAmerican department store shoes will probably be
   mistaken forItalian fashion. Perfect. An average pair of polished
   black slip-ons will get you in the door anywhere. Also, rubber soles
   willsurvive far better than leather soles on the rain soaked
   sidewalksof Europe.
   <p>Instead of shoes, I have become a convert to sandals, morespecifically
   Birkenstocks, a German brand. Once you break in a pairof Birkenstocks
   you will never go back to shoes again, except forduring stormy
   weather. You won't even want to go barefoot again. Birkenstocks have a
   half inch of cork between the hard rubber bottom and the leather part
   you rest your feet in. Cork is very easy to walk on. You can go all
   day in these things. I recommend black socks with the Birkenstocks,
   unless you are at the beach. Birkenstocks are expensive so you can
   make this one of your purchases when in Germany, at prices 50% less
   than the American prices.
   <p>Carry an extra pair of shoes since it is likely that yourshoes will
   get soaked occasionally. If you invest in a pair withnatural leather
   uppers, you can oil them to the point that theyresist water like wax
   paper. Use mink oil or equivalent once aweek.
  <p> Again, do not wear any kind of sports shoes, e.g. tennis,jogging, or
   whatever else they call them these days. I was withsome business
   associates in The Hague a few years ago and wedecided to take a pub
   crawl. Two of them had just bought new joggershoes and wore these out
   for the evening stroll. Several placeswould not allow them in the
   door. These places were just youraverage Dutch cafés and bars, not
   fancy or up-scale. Andmy associates were businessmen in their 50s,
   certainly good potentialcustomers in any establishment. Those doormen
   want to keep their jobs so they keep theoff-spec people outside.
   Nothing looks clunkier than freshwhite tennies. I've heard that the
   French call them marshmellows. In my Amsterdam and Brussels train
   station observations, jogger shoes were worn by less than 5% of those
   passing through, usually by young people with backpacks.
   An alternative for those who like tennies is the Florsheim line of
   shoes called "Comfortech." These are light weight black slip-ons with
   a cushion bottom. They look great at a distance and will get you past
   any maitre d' or doorman.
   <h>Rain Gear
   <p>Weather protection is essential. Bring a telescopingumbrella. You can
   find umbrellas which slide down to under 10 inches. A lightweight
   hooded mackintosh is veryhandy for those frequent all day rains. A
   light pair of leathergloves and a hat are helpful for off-season
   travel, and can even beuseful in northern Europe in the summer.
   <h>WOMEN'S WEAR
   <p>Friends who have read this book often say that it is overly male
   oriented. A major reason,perhaps, is my discussion of clothing, but
   the attitude probablysurfaces in other areas as well. I've seen
   packing lists on the internet written by women who must have had a
   platoon on hand to carry their utterly essential stuff. Some girls
   claim that they simply can'ttravel with only a carry-on bag, and some
   bring everythingbut the kitchen sink on a weekend sortie.
   <h>Here's How
   <p>I used to travel like that but learned the hard way how todo it the
   easy way. For a weekend trip to Paris with my Dutch girlfriend many
   years ago I packed two suitcases with six days worth ofextra clothes
   and other just-in-case stuff and drove over to pick her up.I was
   amazed. She wore a black jumpsuit, colorful scarf, a fashionable
   raincoat, and carried a slightlyoversized purse with everything she
   needed. Although our room was a nice one in an above averagehotel,
   there was hardly enough space to hang my things or stash thesuitcases.
   My precious Paris time was wasted putting things away,deciding what to
   wear, and repacking everything.
   <p>Women writers can give youplenty of tips for advice on how to pack
   light. For encouragement and advice, ladiesshould consult the books of
   Mesdames Dena Kaye, Georgia Hesse , Louise Purwin Zobel , and Eleanor
   Adams Baxel . Some of these books are decades old but the advice is
   timeless.Another great source of clothing advice for women is on line
   at JourneyWoman. This is a collection of first-hand reader-submitted
   comments for countries around the world, with a generous helping for
   every country in Europe.
   <h>Friendly Helpers
   <p>Pack light girls. Yes, you can do it. Yes, you must.
   <p>In fact it is more important for women to pack light thanfor men.
   Remember -- if you pack it you carry it, you burroyou. And if you have
   too much and some helpful stranger offers togive you a hand in a train
   station or tourist office, chances are nine outof ten that he is
   helping himself. You might have nothing left tocarry when he is done
   with you.
   <p>You wonder why a guy would steal awoman's suitcase? He probably has a
   girl friend who would beoverjoyed with some American clothes and
   toiletries. If yoursuitcase takes a walk, I hope that you didn't hide
   your money andpassport in it; cash, I.D., and clothes -- what a score!
   I wrote this paragraph decades ago and recently saw the film "French
   Kiss" with Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan. It is a hoot for Francophiles and
   graphically illustrates my point. I give Kevin first billing for his
   great characterization.
   <p>By the way, when the friendly helper is done with yoursuitcase, you
   might look to see if you still have a purse. One ofhis buddies
   standing nearby probably picked that off as the firstcavalier
   distracted you with his charming accented English. Thisscenario sounds
   a little harsh, but this is the real world, not thefantasy feely-good
   world created by most travel writers. Seechapter 8 for advice on
   avoiding Jesse James and thebandit gangs. They're everywhere, and they
   rarely work alone.
   <h>BUSINESS WEAR
   <p>Casual is not cool.
   <h>No Dockers
   <p>Americans traveling to Europe on business must wear theirbest.
   Impression is critical in doing business overseas. If youwear khaki
   Dockers to work because they are socomfortable, put them aside for
   your trip. A dark plain lightweight wool suit will be accepted for
   alloccasions. Use it for after work social events as well.
   <h>The Tie Is the Thing
   <p>White shirts are fine and are always OK. You'll see many men wearing
   colors. I prefer a light blue. Ties from the top fashion names, or
   knock-offs, are the order of the day.
   <h>Women on Business
   <p>Ladies, please please please leave your Madeline Albright suits
   athome. Better yet just throw them in the trash. Those tight
   pastelskirts and jackets are screaming yuk absolutely horrible.
   <p>What you should do is pack a neutral dark pantssuit, a few of your
   best blouses, and a couple of splashy scarves or a string of pearls. I
   am so happy that our present Secretary of State, Dr. Condoleezza Rice,
   looks right sharp all over the world, and presents an image that all
   Americans can really be proud of. She is cool, so cool. Imitate her
   and you won't go wrong.
   <p>Bring only the jewelry that you can afford to have stolen.
   <h>BEACH WEAR
   <p>Speedos are the tradional beach wear for men in Europe. Younger
   fellows have taken up with California surfer style trunks which they
   wear over the speedos.Women normally wear one piece and two piece
   suits as in the USA. However a large percentage of women leave the top
   half of the bikini at home. Topless girls are everywhere. And the
   tonga is popular, showing 99% of the derrière and leaving not much to
   the imagination.
   <p>To leave even less to the imagination and not wear anything go to one
   of the nude beaches. Going naked is allowed on designated coastal
   beaches and inland waterways throughout Europe.
   <h>LAUNDRY
   <p>Unfortunately you do have to wash your clothes whiletraveling. There
   are several ways to get it done. In packing light you need only 3 days
   worth of everything plus the clothes on your back. This means a
   laundry job twice a week.
   <h>Hotel Service
   <p>In standard tourist class hotels you rarely see a laundrybag, a normal
   item in American motels. When I have found thelaundry bag in Europe I
   almost used it for something else afterreading the prices. It would be
   cheaper to buy new clothes atAmerican prices, but you won't find
   American prices in Europe. Ifthe hotel does not have a cleaning or
   laundry service, the deskclerk will be able to direct you to a dry
   cleaner or laundromat.
   <p>If you are on an extended business trip you probably mustuse the hotel
   service because you don't have time to do ityourself. Some miserly
   Dilbert managers will single out this itemon your expense report and
   try to disallow it. Stand your ground.
   When having dry cleaning done, make sure that cleaning isdone and not
   just pressing. Write down the native word forcleaning. If there are
   spots or stains, point them out to theattendant. Spot removal can't be
   guaranteed because the spot may bedue to loss of dye rather than
   misdirected spaghetti sauce or wine.
   <h>Hostel "Service"
   <p>If you are using hostels as you travel, for the economy or the
   camaraderie, you are likely to find a washing machine in a side room.
   This will be one of the most convenient and cheapest opportunities for
   washing your clothes. If you are traveling in high season you may have
   to wait in line to use the machine.
   <p>These facilities will be strictly self-service. If you don't
   understand the workings of the machine, ask. If you put your stuff in
   and come back six hours later you can expect to see your clothes
   dumped on any adjacent table or chair. Someone else needed to wash. Do
   likewise if you need to, but ask the manager first. Just because the
   machine has stopped does not mean that the wash is finished. It may be
   on one of its pauses.
   <p>Before starting ask what the fee is if it is not posted. You may or
   may not need to furnish your own suds.
  <h> Laundromats
   <p>Public laundromats are usually attended, sometimes are coinoperated,
   normally have restricted hours, and are typically closed one or two
   days aweek. European machines are smaller than American ones and take
   one houror more per load. Part way through the wash cycle the
   machinepauses for an extended soak.
   <p>If you allow the laundromat to dothe wash for you the attendant will
   set the temperature dependingon the color of your clothes. Attendants
   follow the rules on themachine, period. Your permanent press white
   shirts will probably beboiled and returned as permanently wrinkled. I
   suggest that you doit yourself in a coin machine. If you can't read
   the directions,ask around to see if someone speaks English. If that
   fails, watchthe others. Temperatures are in Celsius, a.k.a.
   centigrade. Forinformation on Celsius see chapter 27, "The Metric
   System in Europe."
   <p>The price of one load of wash can be three dollars or more.Detergent
   will be available, either in single load sizes from acoin automat or
   free from a soap tub in the laundromat.
  <p> Dryers are similar to ours so you should have nodifficulty. Dryers
   normally run on a ten minute cycle and the costis reasonable.
   Lonely Planet is the only guide book series which locateslaundromats
   in the major cities. Use their maps and legend to finda place to wash
   your clothes. You don't necessarily want to askyour hotel. The manager
   may direct you to one of his associates orsub-contractors. That is not
   always your best deal.
  <h> Wash Basin or Bidet
   <p>It's the old fashioned way. If you do not want to go to alaundromat
   then you must scrub, soak, rinse, wring, and hang to dry.
  <p> Almost every hotel room in France is posted, "Don't washyour clothes
   in the room, and don't eat in the room" -- freetranslation from le
   français (French). My theory isthat if no drip marks or crumbs are
   left on the floor, the spiritof the hotel keeper's request is honored.
   Hand washing clothes inyour room will certainly save you money, will
   probably occupy less ofyour time, and will relieve you of the
   uncertainty of delay due tosometimes service. Picnicking in your room
   has exactly the same benefits. See chapter 15, "Eating Your Way
   Through Europe."
  <p> Instead of doing your laundry in the wash basin, use thebidet. A
   letter from a reader of an earlier edition asked if thisis sanitary.
   The bidet is clean so why not? You can let yourlaundry soak for a
   while and still be able to brush your teeth andwash your face.
   Wring out yourunderwear and hang it over the usually present radiator.
   It will bewarm and dry by morning. But dust off the radiator first.
   And dothe wash early in the evening since the heat is often turned off
   atnight and then comes back on for a few hours in the morning.
   One challenge to the scrub-it-yourselfer will be in hanging your
   clothes if they are still dripping. This applies to slacks, skirts,
   shirts, blouses, and other outer-wear. If you have no bathtub or
   shower in the room, use anewspaper to catch the drips. Sometimes a bit
   of ingenuity will beneeded to figure out what to tie your line on.
   Some rooms arealmost impossible. Strapping tape can sometimes come to
   the rescue. See chapter 6, "A Packing List for Europe."Take your wash
   down in the morning so that the chambermaid doesn't observe. You
   don'tneed a confrontation with the hotel keeper. If your clothes are
   still damp just hang them in the closet, if there is one.
   <h>BUYING EUROPEAN CLOTHES
  <p> Buying clothes in Europe can be a challenge. Clothing iscut
   differently, partly for style and partly to fit the build ofthe
   average citizen. This varies considerably from country tocountry.
   <h>Size Conversion Tables
  <p> Take care in using the clothing size conversion tablespresented in
   travel books. Tables differ. Sales clerks are seldomknowledgeable or
   helpful on this. They know less about Americansizes than you can learn
   about European sizes. Size tables areposted in some of the large
   department stores, though in somestores I have seen conflicting
   conversion tables for American toEuropean sizes on the wall and on
   garment packages. I have boughtthe same size under shorts with the
   same brand name in two differentEuropean countries. One was loose and
   one was tight.
  <h> The True Test
   <p>If you buy clothes in Europe, have yourself measured by acompetent
   salesperson, if you can find one. Measurements and sizes will normally
   be incentimeters. See chapter 27, "The Metric System in Europe" if you
   don't know what this is. Men's shirt sleeves are measuredfrom the
   shoulders, not the spine. Also try the garment on.Ascertain whether or
   not it will shrink when washed. Cotton itemspurchased in Europe will
   probably shrink. Buy something a size too big, maybe two sizes over.
  <h> HAIR
   <p>Although it is not something that most of us pack for atrip, hair is
   an important part of your wardrobe in the context ofyour appearance.
   <h>Men
  <p> The long grizzly look is characteristic of laborers anddopey students,
   just as it is in the United States. Before you go,get a haircut. Short
   hair is much easier to take care of, animportant consideration while
   traveling. But, don't get a militarytrim. That's too short.
   The morning shave is probably the one thing most men wishthey could do
   without, but it might be better to continue shaving.Beards invoke
   suspicion in many people (e.g., customs agents andairport security
   folks), fear in some (e.g., young women), and instantdislike in most
   of the rest (e.g., hotel clerks and maitres d').You don't need hassles
   and rejections from these folks while youare traveling. But then
   again, wearing a beard saves time and trouble in the morning so make
   your own call on this. Try to keep it neatly trimmed if you have a
   beard. I have had a beard for many years, on and off.I put up with the
   hassles for the convenience of avoiding the morning scrape. See
   chapter 6, "A Packing List for Europe" to learn a better way to shave
   -- with vinegar.
   <h>Women
   <p>Traditionally, European women do not shave their legs. But theyseldom
   show much leg (except at the beach) since their dresses and skirts
   overlap their boots. An American woman traveling in Europe couldeasily
   escape the regular leg shaving. In addition, many European women do
   not shave under their arms. These traditions are crumbling and women
   generally shave these days. Whether or not to go traditional is a
   matter of personal taste.
