<h>Second Stage of the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Bill 2005

S<h>econd Stage Speech by Micheál Martin, Minister for Enterprise, Trade and
Employment in relation to the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Bill, 2005

<h>In Dail Eireann on Thursday 19^th May 2005

   <p>A Cathaoirleach,

  <p> I move "That the Bill be now read a Second Time"

   <p>The Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Bill 2005 is a short but
   vitally important Bill which proposes to protect the State's interests
   in property that has been acquired for industrial development purposes
   by IDA Ireland, Shannon Development and Udarás na Gaeltachta by
   including these bodies among the "State authorities" that are not
   bound by the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No.2) Act 1978.

   <p>Section 16 of the Industrial Development Act 1986 empowers IDA Ireland
   to purchase, lease and dispose of property for the establishment,
   development or maintenance of an industrial undertaking but for no
   other purpose. This was amended by the Industrial Development Act 1995
   to permit IDA Ireland to dispose of properties for other purposes but
   only with the express consent of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade
   and Employment. In order to comply with the requirement of the 1986
   Act and for good estate management reasons, IDA Ireland adopted the
   practice of selling property by way of long lease (usually for a term
   of 999 years) with a covenant restricting the use of the land to
   manufacturing or the supply of internationally traded services. The
   leases also contain provision for rent review which removes them from
   the scope of the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Acts, that
   entitle a leaseholder to acquire the fee simple. Acquisition of the
   fee simple under the Acts would result in the covenant restricting the
   use of the land being extinguished. IDA Ireland estimates that it has
   entered into over 700 such leases.

   <p>In December 1981, IDA Ireland granted a lease of a unit in one of its
   industrial estates to a client company, which subsequently erected
   industrial premises on the land. The original client assigned its
   interest to a second company in 2000 which in turn, granted a
   sub-lease to a third company, in November 2004. The following day a
   Notice of Intention to acquire the fee simple interest was served on
   IDA Ireland by the third company. It transpired that the sub-lease had
   been structured in such a manner - entailing a term of 50 years plus
   one day, the payment of a fee and no provision for rent review - as to
   comply with the conditions in the Landlord and Tenant Acts entitling a
   lessee to acquire the fee simple. The second and third companies are
   connected companies.

   <p>IDA Ireland contested the application when it was heard before the
   County Registrar on 7 April 2005 and the hearing was first adjourned
   to 18 April and subsequently to 17 May. However, Senior Counsel
   advised IDA Ireland that the sub-lease conferred a statutory
   entitlement to acquire the freehold interest. This was confirmed by
   advice provided to the Attorney General. On the basis of this advice,
   IDA decided to negotiate a settlement and agreed a price for the
   conveyance of the fee simple. Having been advised by the Attorney
   General, I decided to grant my consent to this settlement so as to
   secure the best return to the Exchequer in the circumstances. The
   County Registrar was informed of the proposed settlement at the
   adjourned resumed hearing this Tuesday, 17 May.

  <p> This case, which was first brought to my Department's attention on 2
   March 2005, highlights the fact that a legitimate scheme can be
   devised whereby sub-leases created by lessees can establish an
   entitlement for the sub-lessee to acquire the fee simple thus
   extinguishing restrictive covenants in the head lease. This anomalous
   situation, whereby a sub-lessee can extinguish an agreement between
   the lessee and a third party, was noted by the Law Reform Commission
   in 1989 and again in 1992. This has serious implications for IDA
   Ireland both in relation to the execution of its statutory functions
   and also in relation to the possible loss of value to the State in any
   sale of its land assets. In addition, enquiries by my Department have
   shown that there are also similar implications for Shannon Free
   Airport Development Company and Udarás na Gaeltachta in the operation
   of their property functions related to their industrial development
   roles.

  <p> On learning of this issue, my Department immediately examined the
   matter, including initial examination of the legal and practical
   implications both in relation to the specific case cited above and to
   the general implications in respect of the impact on the role and
   effectiveness of the State's industrial development agencies and the
   assets they hold on behalf of the State. When these became clearer,
   the matter was brought to my attention on 13 April and a process put
   in place to remedy the situation. This has lead to the Bill, which I
   am presenting to the Houses of the Oireachtas here today.

  <p> High standard property solutions, both business parks and buildings,
   for both inward investment and indigenous enterprises are crucial for
   regional industrial development in Ireland. In order to provide
   attractive locations for such inward investment and indigenous
   enterprise, elaborate master plans have been drawn up for such
   estates. If individual tenants are entitled to purchase the fee
   simple, thereby circumventing the covenants in the original head
   leases, then the agencies concerned will not be able to ensure that
   such property continues to be used for the legislative purposes for
   which it was provided. In effect, the agencies' ability to control
   activities on their industrial estates will be undermined. As well as
   giving rise to a situation whereby State assets are not being used for
   the purposes of each of the agencies' industrial development mandate,
   the agencies will also be faced with estate management issues in that
   they will not be able to enforce covenants such as "quiet enjoyment"
   on their estates. Finally it is also unlikely that any tenant will
   continue to pay service charges if another occupier is not paying
   similar charges.

  <p> There will also be a loss in the value of State assets. Using the
   sub-lease mechanism, the private sector may be put in a position to
   make substantial gains from property which was originally provided by
   Exchequer funding. There is a substantial difference in value between
   a freehold title and a leasehold title subject to covenants, and it is
   clear that the valuation mechanism set out in the Landlord and Tenant
   legislation which is based on a multiple of the ground rent will not
   yield that value to the head lessor, in this case the three
   named-agencies.

  <p> The selling price that is sought by the agencies is determined by
   valuation, which is based on the existence of the restrictive user
   covenants. If these covenants cannot be enforced, the selling price of
   the land should be higher to reflect the freedom of the purchaser to
   use the land as he/she pleases. This may make the selling price
   unattractive to potential purchasers, including inward investment
   concerns, who intend to use the property for qualifying activities and
   will consequently adversely affect the agencies' ability to carry out
   their industrial development functions.

  <p> The advice of the Attorney General was sought regarding the
   legislative action necessary to prevent the widespread use of the
   device employed in the case referred to above. The Attorney General
   has advised that an amendment be enacted to section 4 of the Landlord
   and Tenant (Ground Rents)(No. 2) Act, 1978 which currently provides as
   follows:

  <p> This Act shall not bind a Minister of the Government, the
   Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland or the Irish Land Commission.

  <p> The purpose of the amendment would be to include IDA Ireland, Shannon
   Development and Udarás na Gaeltachta among the "State authorities"
   that are not bound by the legislation.

 <p>  IDA Ireland, Shannon Development and Udarás na Gaeltachta enter into
   leasehold arrangements in respect of their properties in the context
   of their industrial development functions. In IDA Ireland's case, the
   agency has estimated that there are over 700 leases where its
   ownership of State property is at risk. While the current application
   has been settled out of court, there is no guarantee that it will not
   act as a catalyst for other similar cases. The Attorney General has
   advised that the proposed legislative amendment could not apply
   retrospectively where a notice of intention to acquire the fee simple
   in land leased from one of the agencies has been served. Accordingly,
   considerable urgency attaches to securing early passage of the
   amending provision. I therefore urge all members of the House to
   support the Bill, the objective of which is to protect the interests
   of taxpayers and the State.

  <p> The Bill is being introduced today, with a view to its passage through
   both Houses of the Oireachtas in one day and signature by the
   President without delay. This is considered to be of the utmost
   urgency and necessity in view of the circumstances I have outlined.

  <p> Turning to the contents of the Bill itself, the Bill is a short one,
   containing only four sections.

  <p> Section 1 defines the relevant Acts.

  <p> Section 2 provide for the amendment of section 4 of the Landlord and
   Tenant (Ground Rents) (No.2) Act 1978 by adding the Industrial
   Development Agency (Ireland), the Shannon Free Airport Development
   Company and Udarás na Gaeltachta to the list already cited: the
   opportunity has also been taken to remove the reference to the Irish
   Land Commission as it no longer exists.

  <p> Section 3 provides the appropriate savers in respect of notice of
   intention or any application made in relation to the acquisition of
   the fee simple before the passing of the Bill or any arbitration or
   appeal to the Circuit Court in respect of such a notice or
   application.

  <p> Section 4 sets out the short title of the Bill and the collective
   citation.

  <p> I commend the Bill to this House.
