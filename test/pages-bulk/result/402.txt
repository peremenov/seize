<p>It is sometimes easy to forget that EPA Region 2 employees, working
virtually in the shadow of the World Trade Center, were as personally
affected by the collapse of the towers as anyone in lower Manhattan.
<h>"Oh My God, Look at That Plane!"

  <p> For many Region 2 employees, the work day was just getting under way
   on September 11 when the first airplane hit the World Trade Center.
   Bonnie Bellow, regional communications director, was at a coffee cart
   on the corner of Reade Street and Broadway when the first plane hit.

  <p> Bellow recalls: "Somebody behind me on line yelled, `Oh my God, look
   at that plane!' We all turned. It was going so fast, we turned and it
   had gone behind the buildings. The plane itself was blocked by the
   Woolworth Building, so we couldn't actually see it, but within a few
   seconds we heard the explosion and the ground shook. It's a moment
   that will, I think, be forever stopped in time. It was a moment that
   felt like total silence."
     

   <p> "Literally within minutes after the first attack on the World Trade
   Center, EPA employees were on the scene. Even in the midst of so much
      loss and sorrow, you persevered. ... Your quick response helped
   safeguard the health of thousands of rescue workers and civilians. ...
   Each and every one of you has earned the respect of your peers and the
                          gratitude of a nation."

           <p>"Excellence in Response" Employee Recognition Ceremony
                                <p>July 3, 2002
     _________________________________________________________________

<h>Opening Moments

   <p>Seconds after the first explosion, Kathy Callahan, then acting
   director of the region's Emergency and Remedial Response Division,
   telephoned Bruce Sprague, head of the Response and Prevention Branch
   in Edison, to set in motion the region's emergency response. In those
   first moments, Callahan believed it was a horrendous accident that
   might require EPA's involvement because of the smoke, fire, and
   airplane fuel.

                                

  <p> Many employees witnessed the second plane's impact from their office
   windows at 290 Broadway, just a few blocks from the World Trade
   Center. One of them was Deputy Regional Administrator William J.
   Muszynski, who was acting Regional Administrator for the first three
   months of the response. "When the second plane hit," Muszynski says,
   "there was no question that this was not an accident. You could tell
   from the way the plane approached that it was no accident. That's when
   people in the building began to be concerned that perhaps these
   (federal) buildings were also targeted, and people began to leave the
   building."

  <p> While the Manhattan office evacuated, EPA's Edison office geared up.

  <p> Neil Norrell was one of many Edison employees watching the events
   unfold on TV. "When the second plane hit," Norrell says, "we just
   started getting stuff ready. We weren't sure what we were going to do,
   but we figured we'd be doing something."

                                

  <p> Within minutes, Sprague dispatched the first crew of Agency on-scene
   coordinators (OSCs) from Edison to New York City to monitor ambient
   environmental conditions. OSCs Mike Solecki, Mike Ferriola, Gad
   Tawadros, and Bob Montgomery were a few blocks away when the first
   tower began to collapse.

  <p> "Someone yelled, `I smell gas, I smell gas' and everyone began
   running," Solecki says. "The dust there was so thick, I couldn't see
   the hand in front of my face."

  <p> The OSCs had to scramble just to find where New York City had set up
   its temporary command center. The city's state-of-the-art Emergency
   Operations Center had been located in the World Trade Center complex
   and was destroyed in the collapse, sending the mayor and other top
   officials scurrying for safety. All radio communications were lost,
   and the dust was so bad, not even EPA's satellite phones worked.

  <p> Overcoming such obstacles, the OSCs took the first dust samples within
   an hour or two of the collapse. "We didn't really have a lot of
   sampling equipment," Solecki says, "So we went to a local store and
   bought ziploc bags. We had to do things like that," he says.

  <p> Muszynski, who returned to his office after sending 290 Broadway
   employees home and coordinated the Region 2 response through computer
   contact with Sprague and phone contact with EPA headquarters, points
   out, "While most people were going away from the site, our emergency
   crews were coming toward the site. That's part of the initial
   reaction, and I think it's predominantly because of the training they
   have about how to respond to a disaster."

  <p> "It wasn't until weeks later," Sprague recalls, "that I realized, when
   I finally had some time to really think, I wonder whether these guys
   thought about the danger that they were going into. They were going to
   go through the Holland Tunnel. Well, was the Holland Tunnel going to
   be blown up? Was there something else that was going to happen? I
   didn't even think about that. There were so many other things racing
   through my mind at that time."

                                

  <p> Later that day, after the buildings collapsed, EPA sent crews from its
   Environmental Response Team (ERT), also located in Edison, to Brooklyn
   and Liberty State Park, just across from lower Manhattan. The Brooklyn
   crew gathered dust and air samples, the New Jersey team only air
   samples, "because the wind wasn't blowing there," Muszynski remembers.

  <p> Three Region 2 employees lost family members in the attacks that day.
   Many others, including OSC Steve Touw, lost dear friends.

  <p> "Father Mychal Judge (the New York City Fire Department chaplain
   listed as the first casualty of the World Trade Center attacks)
   actually married my wife and I," Touw explains. "He had been the
   parish priest at our church when my wife was in high school and was
   very actively involved in the parish. So when we got engaged, we
   immediately called Father Mychal and asked him to come back and do the
   wedding. When I was driving home on the night of the 11th, I got hold
   of my wife on the phone and she told me she had heard on the news that
   Father Mychal was killed. So I took this response very personally."

                               

<h>Week One: Directing the Response from Edison

   <p>With its lower Manhattan headquarters off-limits for nearly two weeks,
   Region 2 began 24-hour operations in Edison. By the morning of
   September 12, the analysis of the bulk dust samples taken on the day
   of the attacks was completed, showing asbestos levels ranging from
   non-detects to 4.5 percent (1 percent is the level at which dust is
   considered to be asbestos-containing). That day, EPA on-scene
   coordinators established nine monitoring stations in the World Trade
   Center area.

   <p>Although EPA eventually monitored for hundreds of contaminants, OSC
   Chris Jimenez, who arrived at Ground Zero on September 12, explains
   how they first approached the disaster. "The way we started was, OK,
   we know asbestos is an issue. We know VOCs (volatile organic
   compounds) are going to be an issue because of the burning. We also
   knew there are other chemicals that you'll find as a result of fires -
   acid gases as an example. We knew we were going to want to sample
   those immediately."

                              

   <p>Jimenez says that one of the first difficulties was in establishing
   air monitoring locations. "We couldn't really get very close because
   the police and fire departments were trying to keep everyone back. It
   was incredibly smoky. We ended up having to run because there were
   alarms going off from buildings possibly coming down."

   <p>From Edison, the Region 2 leadership worked with EPA headquarters, the
   Federal Emergency Management Agency, and New York city and state
   agencies to coordinate a multi-faceted response, acting on FEMA
   mission assignments under the Federal Response Plan triggered by the
   disaster declaration issued by President Bush the night of the
   attacks.

   <p>In addition to the monitoring already under way, EPA assumed lead
   responsibility for hazardous waste collection and disposal, street
   vacuuming and power washing, and the operation of wash stations for
   workers and trucks at Ground Zero and the landfill. (Strike Teams from
   the U.S. Coast Guard's National Strike Force provided enormous support
   - both manpower and technical assistance - as EPA carried out its
   mission assignments.)


   <p>Along with its critical role in protecting public health and safety,
   EPA took part in helping Wall Street get up and running. On September
   12, EPA began vacuuming the streets, using specially equipped trucks
   to remove dust and debris from lower Manhattan's financial district.
   Over the next few days, with help from the Coast Guard, EPA also
   escorted financial district executives back to their offices to
   retrieve backup computer system files.

   <p>OSC Andy Confortini explains: "The Bond Market Association would fax
   over a list of the firms that needed to get into their buildings. We
   would set up a schedule to meet up with them outside the Ground Zero
   perimeter, get them onto our vehicles, take them down to their
   buildings, give them a mask and take them where they had to be to get
   their backup systems and files. The Coast Guard would go there the day
   before to evaluate the building for `immediately dangerous to life and
   health' conditions - combustible gas, low oxygen, high CO2, any kind
   of volatile organics. They would do that recon and report back to me.
   There were a lot of natural gas leaks, but there was only one building
   that we never got into (the Deutsche Bank building adjacent to the WTC
   site) because of structural concerns and because of gas leaks."

                                

   <p>EPA Administrator Whitman toured Ground Zero on September 13,
   accompanied by Muszynski. "There was a concern that one or two of the
   buildings had the danger of collapsing," Muszynski recalls. "As we
   were walking down there they had one or two alarms. Can you imagine
   evacuating and saying, no, it's OK to go back to work, and you go back
   to work and the alarm goes off and you have to evacuate again? To
   think about the courage people had to go back in those conditions and
   still search for survivors, it was incredible."

  <p> Over the first week of the response, as police, fire fighters, and
   rescue workers searched for victims amid the rubble and battled the
   fires that would burn for months within the pile, EPA expanded its
   ambient environmental monitoring activities, increasing both the
   number of fixed stations and the contaminants to be probed. On-scene
   coordinators were also assigned to monitor conditions at the Fresh
   Kills landfill, where debris from the World Trade Center was
   transported for sifting by federal crime investigators, including
   members of EPA's Criminal Investigation Division.

    

  <p> The chief purpose of EPA's monitoring was to assess health risks for
   the workers at Ground Zero and for those who would soon return to work
   and live in lower Manhattan. EPA labs and private labs under contract
   to the Agency analyzed air and dust samples for asbestos and a host of
   other contaminants, then turned the data over to an interagency team
   of scientists. The team included Dore LaPosta, then acting director of
   the region's Division of Environmental Science and Assessment (DESA).

  <p> The challenge was to determine at which level each contaminant posed a
   health concern, so that the data could be reported meaningfully.
   Health-based benchmarks had never been established for many
   contaminants being monitored.

   <p>For example, no outdoor standards existed for airborne asbestos
   exposure, which more commonly occurs indoors. Asbestos, a
   heat-resistant material used as fire-proofing in part of the World
   Trade Center, is known to cause lung cancer and asbestosis. EPA turned
   to a nationally accepted standard for asbestos that is based on
   long-term indoor exposure: the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act
   (AHERA) standard of 70 structures per square millimeter, which is used
   to determine whether children may re-enter a school building after
   asbestos removal or abatement.

   <p>"Once we got the data," says LaPosta, "we had to start judging and
   evaluating it against whatever we came up with as the best parameters.
   We had to work with the risk assessment people and other people in the
   field to figure out, for instance, whether the AHERA standard is the
   right standard and what does that mean from a risk perspective? And
   what do we do about dioxin - do we use a 30-year removal number, do we
   use a one-year number, or do we use an OSHA (Occupational Safety and
   Health Administration) number? These criteria issues became a data
   management and assessment problem we had to work through."

   <p>Sampling quickly extended from air and dust to water. After a heavy
   rain prompted concerns that hazardous material from the collapsed
   buildings was seeping into water supplies, EPA sampled drinking water
   at 13 distribution points in New York City as well as water pumped out
   of the Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) train tunnels that flooded
   after the collapse. Drinking water sampling results showed no
   contamination and, in fact, the only impact on water detected by EPA
   was a small amount of temporarily elevated levels of asbestos and
   other compounds in storm-drain runoff in the Hudson River.

   

<h>Return to 290 Broadway

  <p> As the financial district returned to operation, EPA continued its
   vacuuming activities. Bulk dust sampling in and around Ground Zero had
   indicated an uneven spread of asbestos-containing dust in the area;
   the Agency decided to vacuum all public spaces throughout lower
   Manhattan. Coordinated by OSC Dan Harkay, 10 vacuum trucks removed
   dust from streets and sidewalks, open areas such as parks and
   sandboxes, and federal building lobbies (including 290 Broadway) into
   which response workers had carried dust on their shoes.

  <p> With the lower Manhattan cleanup progressing quickly, EPA set a return
   date of September 24 for employees working at 290 Broadway. In the
   interim, Muszynski and Assistant Regional Administrator Herb Barrack
   worked with EPA headquarters to restore the facility's communications
   capabilities, which were lost when a major telephone switching station
   was inundated with water following the World Trade Center collapse.
   They also arranged through EPA headquarters to provide trauma
   counseling for Region 2 employees, enlisting a Massachusetts-based
   group with broad experience in counseling disaster victims.

  <p> "The question was," Barrack says, "should we bring employees right to
   the regional office or transition by another location first, where
   they wouldn't be immediately confronted with going back to the horrors
   that they experienced? We reached consensus that it was better to do
   it offsite."

  <p> The voluntary session, held at the Grand Hyatt in mid-town Manhattan,
   drew more than 600 employees - about three-quarters of the region's
   workforce. The trauma group also provided counselors for EPA employees
   re-entering their lower Manhattan offices on September 24.

   

<h>Work at Ground Zero

   <p>"The first day you came in," Norrell says about his on-scene
   coordinator experience at Ground Zero, "you didn't have any idea what
   to expect. For the first hour or so you found yourself from time to
   time just staring at it, seeing and not believing. It was enormous."

   <p>OSCs assigned to Ground Zero carried out several functions: removing
   hazardous materials; monitoring environmental conditions in and around
   the site; establishing on-site wash stations to decontaminate workers
   and trucks involved in the rescue and recovery; contributing personal
   protection equipment to the rescue effort; and communicating with
   recovery workers and other agencies about monitoring results and their
   implications for health and safety.

   <p>Solecki recalls climbing through gaps in and below the pile at Ground
   Zero alongside search-and-rescue personnel, beginning the third night.
   "I went through the hole every night. I worked a lot with the USAR
   (Urban Search and Rescue) people, and I actually went through with
   them looking for bodies. That wasn't my purpose - my purpose was
   looking for hazmats ... I didn't really find anything at first because
   there was so much rubble."

    

   <p>EPA on-scene coordinators pumped approximately 600,000 gallons of oil
   from the World Trade Center sub-basements and removed a host of other
   hazardous materials, such as dry cleaning fluids, fire extinguishers,
   and underground fuel tanks. They also monitored for Freon R-22 leaks
   from the trade center's enormous refrigeration system, especially when
   city officials posed the possibility (later disproved) that this
   particular form of Freon, when combusted, would form the poison gas
   phosgene.

   <p>Throughout EPA's response, asbestos monitoring remained a top
   priority. Twice each day, OSCs collected samples from more than 20
   different fixed continuous air monitoring locations in and around
   Ground Zero. Of the more than 9,500 samples eventually collected, only
   21 measured above the 70-structures-per-square-millimeter level of
   concern. Even those 21 samples did not reflect a significant long-term
   health risk. Asbestos exposure generally becomes a health concern when
   high concentrations of asbestos fibers are inhaled over a long period.
   Illness is very unlikely to result from a single, high-level exposure,
   or from a short period of exposure to lower levels.


   <p>Along with asbestos monitoring, EPA sampled the ambient air for
   volatile organic compounds such as benzene, metals such as lead, and
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), dioxin, particulates, silica,
   and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).

   <p>Of particular concern were substances associated with the fires that
   burned at Ground Zero. Monitoring took place in the smoke plumes each
   day as the fires burned, and later in the recovery pits and at a
   number of stations ringing the Ground Zero site. Early on, EPA found
   elevated levels of some substances in the smoke itself, but these
   levels tailed off dramatically even a few feet from the source of the
   smoke. Once the fires ceased, the pollutants fell to either extremely
   low levels - well below EPA's benchmarks - or to undetectable levels.

   <p>Although the risks were considered short-term, many people, including
   EPA employees at 290 Broadway, had teary eyes, scratchy throats, and
   other respiratory problems in the early months while the fires were
   raging. Members of the public were instructed by EPA and the health
   agencies to consult their doctors if they were experiencing symptoms
   related to the dust and smoke from the fires.

   <p>"We were getting relatively high levels of some pretty hazardous
   chemicals, benzene being the most prominent of them," Jimenez says.
   "Right from the vents we were getting relatively high levels, but if
   you would take a sample just stepping away even a couple of feet, the
   levels would drop off dramatically. Plus, provided you were wearing
   your respiratory protection and changing your cartridges regularly,
   the levels of benzene we were finding we didn't see as hazardous to
   yourself."

                                 

   <p>While OSHA and New York City, which controlled the site, had
   responsibility for enforcing safety standards at Ground Zero, EPA
   on-scene coordinators did all they could to encourage rescue workers
   to wear respirators and other personal protection equipment. EPA
   contributed tens of thousands of respirators and other equipment,
   using the Agency's own stock and new orders from vendors.
   Nevertheless, many rescue workers opted not to use the safety
   equipment.

   <p>"From day one, we said you gotta wear respirators," Sprague recalls,
   "and we supplied a lot of equipment. ... The issue became very
   frustrating."

   <p>Jimenez says, "Guys would be sitting near a huge plume of smoke with
   no respirator on, and you'd look at them and say, listen, you should
   be putting your respirator on. We put out press releases (advising
   that Ground Zero workers wear respirators). Having said that, a
   building falls, the building's on fire, it is made with plastics and
   fuel oils, it doesn't take a bit of common sense to realize that you
   should probably have a respirator on."

   <p>Norrell is philosophical about it. "There was absolutely nothing
   anyone could have said - whether you're EPA or any other agency or
   person - that was going to stop anybody from doing what they were
   doing," he said in March. "Certainly not during the first couple of
   days and probably even not now. Firemen are still down there finding
   their brothers. The only thing we could have done is exactly what we
   did, which was identify the need for everybody who was working here to
   wear a respirator, and then do the best we could in conjunction with
   other folks."

                           

   <p>EPA faced a similar challenge as OSCs worked to install personal and
   truck wash stations at the disaster site. By September 19, seven wash
   stations were in operation at Ground Zero, and five more would be
   added in the next few days. But without the authority to enforce
   compliance (the City of New York controlled the site), on-scene
   coordinators had to rely on the power of persuasion - and ultimately
   the lure of a warm meal.

   <p>"Many, many conflicts were always going on," recalls Jim Daloia,
   Emergency Response Team leader. "The contractors on the site would
   say, we will build our own wash station, and besides, the site you
   selected was too far from our equipment."

   <p>As work continued in October and November, EPA worked to erect a
   260-foot by 120-foot central wash station - heated in anticipation of
   winter - for all Ground Zero workers. The temporary structure provided
   boot and mask washes, high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) vacuums
   for dusty clothing, and shower stalls and lockers for worker use.

                             

   <p>"We built this thing really big," Sprague recalls, "thinking that half
   of it would be used by the City for something, maybe either for food
   or for an indoor memorial that the workers from Ground Zero would get
   some positive feelings from. When the City decided to have the
   Salvation Army use it for food, that really made the operation go
   well."

   <p>"When we first opened it up, we had a trickle of people coming in,"
   says John Higgins, who acted as operations chief for the regional
   response. "That could have been a very large white elephant. If we
   didn't partner with New York City and the Salvation Army and get food
   in there, forget it."

   <p>The tent, which acquired the nickname "Taj Mahal" among workers,
   eventually attracted more than 650,000 worker-visits to its wash
   stations and food lines - 6,000 people on its busiest days.

   <p>Nine months at Ground Zero provided EPA on-scene coordinators with
   technical, logistical, and physical challenges - and human ones as
   well. This was not only a disaster site but also a murder scene.

  <p> "You'd see the look in the fire fighters' eyes whenever they would
   recover somebody, or the police would recover somebody from the
   uniformed services," Touw says. "They'd have the procession of the
   flag-draped stretcher. You'd see these grown men, these muscular
   construction workers, firemen, and police officers, holding hands
   saying the Lord's Prayer and crying, hugging each other after it was
   over. Things like that were a constant reminder of what had happened."

   <p>OSC Arlene Anderson, who spent a month and a half working at Ground
   Zero, says, "I will never forget the day when they found the first
   hundred victims in the North Tower. It was an image that will always
   stay with me."

                              
   <p>"There were definitely things here that I never thought I'd have to
   see, never thought I'd have to deal with," Norrell recalls. "The
   hardest part is when they were bringing families (of victims) through.
   You realize that a wife who lost a husband, or a husband who lost a
   wife, they're going to look at this big dusty pile of steel that has
   some smoke coming out, and that's it. That's the only closure they're
   ever going to have."

   

<h>The Landfill

   <p>On a wall in the EPA trailer at the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten
   Island, a makeshift sign was scrawled on duct tape, reading, A little
   bit of hell on earth.

   <p>OSC Greg DeAngelis explains that, as emotionally charged an assignment
   as Ground Zero rescue and recovery was, work at the landfill was
   perhaps even harder. "They were sifting to a much finer detail,
   finding many, many more very graphic things," DeAngelis says. "It's
   one thing to find a whole, dead body, but when you find bits and
   pieces... I feel for these cops. They have to be having nightmares
   from things that they're seeing on a daily basis. It's just absolutely
   brutal."


   <p>EPA was one of many federal, local, state, and nonprofit agencies
   supporting the police work at Fresh Kills. The landfill, officially
   closed to garbage disposal just a few months earlier, became a sifting
   area for investigators hunting for evidence from the World Trade
   Center rubble. Mountains of debris were hauled by barge from Manhattan
   to the landfill during the cleanup at Ground Zero; a separate area at
   the landfill was dedicated to evidence from Building Seven, which
   housed FBI files, weapons, and other highly sensitive federal
   government items.

   <p>Just as at Ground Zero, EPA provided wash stations for workers and
   vehicles, monitored air and dust for asbestos and other contaminants,
   and removed hazardous materials. At the landfill EPA also inspected
   the washing and vacuuming of cars crushed in the collapse and the
   washing of New York City Department of Sanitation barges. Most of the
   cars were decontaminated and eventually sent off-site for recycling.

   <p>EPA on-scene coordinators initially set up 10 air sampling locations
   at the landfill - eight around the perimeter and two within the
   sifting areas. They later added three off-site locations to make sure
   the winds weren't carrying contaminants into the surrounding
   communities. During the course of the landfill operations, EPA took
   more than 5,200 air samples, finding asbestos above the AHERA standard
   in less than 1 percent of the samples.

   <p>"We never hit the OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit," DeAngelis points
   out, referring to the federal standard for asbestos exposure under
   OSHA (.1 fiber per cubic centimeter averaged over an eight-hour day),
   designed to protect workers on the job. The discrepancy between the
   AHERA and OSHA standards caused confusion among some workers,
   according to DeAngelis. "When we would come up with a hit on (the
   AHERA) standard, but the OSHA standards wasn't coming up with a hit
   because it was less than their level of concern, in the workers' minds
   somebody was lying to them."


   <p>Confortini took charge of EPA's effort to build wash stations. The
   stations, which were completed in the first week in October, processed
   about 2,000 people a day and replaced temporary washing facilities
   provided by the National Guard. "There were people sitting in cars
   with their work gloves on," Confortini recalls. "They were so focused
   on evidence retrieval, and retrieval of remains, that they weren't
   thinking about health and safety."

   <p>After the wash stations were built, Confortini communicated regularly
   with managers of each of the law enforcement agencies involved in the
   sifting to achieve compliance with the site's health and safety
   procedures. He credits the NYPD leadership for much of the personal
   hygiene success at the landfill.

   <p>"My job is not to police all these law enforcement guys who have guns
   and bullet-proof vests," says Confortini. "I haven't got a gun. My job
   was to get their management to do it. When the rank and file
   understood that their management recognized and mandated the washing
   protocols, it meant something, rather than some guy from the EPA."

                            

   <p>Fresh Kills also served as a staging ground for the final disposal of
   the 1.6 million tons of debris from the World Trade Center. Thanks to
   concerted efforts by the city and EPA, much of the debris was recycled
   - including heavy steel, light steel, compressed gas cylinders,
   crushed cars, batteries, and flourescent light ballasts. Hazardous
   materials were set aside for proper disposal.

   <p>"Some of the recycling," DeAngelis says, "was done with the eye that
   we didn't want materials to show up on eBay as souvenir items. We
   needed to make sure, when we got certain items like SCBA
   (self-contained breathing apparatus) bottles, that they were crushed
   and cut to where they couldn't be sold that way, and then either
   recycled or disposed of."

   

<h>Communicating the Response

   

   <p>EPA faced a daily communications challenge: explaining the monitoring
   data in a meaningful way to news reporters, citizens, community
   groups, and the rescue and recovery workers. While the data was
   clearly showing no pattern of extended exposure to long-term health
   risks, individual exceedances such as those for asbestos and
   particulate matter were cause for concern among the press and public,
   especially when local residents and rescue workers began experiencing
   short-term health effects, such as persistent coughs.

   <p>"In a time when the public wanted absolute assurance," says EPA
   spokesperson Mary Mears, "not only could EPA not give it to them, but
   science can't give them that kind of assurance."

  <p> "People wanted to see the information," Muszynski says. "They just
   didn't want to see data. They wanted to see what it represented and
   where it came from."


  <p> With assistance from the headquarters Information Technology team, EPA
   established a computer database tied to the agency's Geographic
   Imaging System (GIS) to gather and report monitoring results for all
   the contaminants being sampled. Daily monitoring summaries were posted
   on the EPA Web site and made available to the press throughout the
   recovery operations. Each day, EPA brought the Fire Department and
   other responding agencies its latest sampling data on volatile organic
   compounds so that recovery workers could take appropriate precautions.

   <p>"The monitoring system was something EPA can be really proud of," says
   Callahan, whom Regional Administrator Jane M. Kenny placed in charge
   of the response's day-to-day operations. Callahan worked on the
   monitoring data system with LaPosta and EPA staffers including Joe
   Cosentino, Nick Magriples, and Mark Gallo, along with city, state, and
   federal agencies. "It was collaborative and forthright," Callahan
   says. "Everyone just kept talking and working together."

   <p>In addition to responding to the flood of press inquiries - Mears
   estimates that Region 2 handled upwards of 100 press calls a day in
   the first week of the response - EPA also reported on its monitoring
   results at numerous public meetings around the city and in testimony
   before city, state, and federal committees.

    

<h>A New Phase Begins

   <p>As recovery efforts at Ground Zero and Fresh Kills landfill came to an
   end, EPA halted its activities at these sites as well. Outdoor
   environmental monitoring ended at Ground Zero in late May and at the
   landfill several weeks later, and the wash tents came down soon
   afterward.

   <p>EPA's role in the response has now entered a new phase: providing
   local residents the assurance that their homes have been cleaned
   properly.

   <p>In the first several months of the response, EPA urged people who
   returned to dusty homes and workplaces to have these indoor spaces
   professionally cleaned. With concerns about indoor air quality
   lingering into the new year, EPA Administrator Whitman established the
   Task Force on Indoor Air in Lower Manhattan to address the problem.

  
   <p>In May, responding to the Task Force's recommendations, Regional
   Administrator Kenny announced a cleanup plan for residences in lower
   Manhattan in conjunction with the city, FEMA, OSHA, and New York
   State. She said in announcing the program, "While the scientific data
   about any immediate health risks from indoor air is reassuring, people
   should not have to live with uncertainty about their futures."

   <p>The voluntary program gives lower Manhattan residents the option of
   either having their units tested for asbestos or cleaned and then
   tested by professional cleaners on contract with the government.
   Residents can also request free HEPA vacuum cleaners through the
   program.

   During the summer, EPA tested various cleanup techniques in a
   still-unoccupied building near the World Trade Center site. Testing
   began on a limited number of the more than 800 units at which
   residents requested testing only, and EPA anticipates that cleaning of
   the more than 3,000 units requesting cleaning and testing will begin
   in the next few weeks.

 

<h>Final Impressions

   <p>On the day of the attacks, Acting Regional Administrator Muszynski was
   preparing for a 9 a.m. meeting with officials from Puerto Rico on
   drinking water issues. For obvious reasons, that meeting never
   happened on September 11. It was finally held in the summer of 2002 -
   a sign that life at EPA's Region 2 is beginning to return to normal.

   <p>"Everybody understands how impossible it probably is for us to get
   back to do the usual things," Muszynski says. "The Trade Centers are
   no longer there, so it's a constant reminder. So as the Administrator
   has said, we will go back to doing the usual things, we just won't
   always do them as we usually did them."

   <p>As many Region 2 staffers look back on an unforgettable year, they do
   so with pride.

                  

   <p>"Are there things we could have done better along the way? Yes, as
   anyone would expect," says Barbara Finazzo, who was Acting Deputy
   Regional Administrator last September. "But I firmly believe we
   responded in the best way that we knew how. I will always stand by the
   fact that I'm very proud of what we all did."

   <p>"There was a lot of dedication, a lot of serious consideration of
   science issues, a lot of reaching out to people beyond our agency who
   could provide information about the issues we were dealing with, and a
   tireless effort," says LaPosta.

   <p>"I'm proud of the fact," Mears says, "that a whole group of people
   from this agency pulled together in a hurry despite being traumatized
   on all different levels and turned our attention to whether the people
   in and around lower Manhattan were safe. (And) I'm really proudest of
   the people who actually went out there day after day after day, on
   that pile, taking samples, not because they were worried about their
   own health but because they wanted to make sure we were protecting the
   health of the people of New York."

   <p>Norrell may have summed it up best for his fellow OSCs - and, indeed,
   all EPA staff involved - when he explained the privilege he felt at
   taking part in the response. "Everybody in the world wanted to do
   something, and I was getting the chance to do something."

 

   <p>True to its mission to safeguard public health and protect the
   environment, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been
   playing a key role in the nation's response to the September 11, 2001
   terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. With much help from EPA
   headquarters and other regions, more than 200 employees from EPA's
   Region 2 offices in lower Manhattan and Edison, New Jersey, have
   engaged in the response at Ground Zero and the Staten Island landfill
   where debris was brought for evidence-gathering. Their major
   activities have included:

   <h>o monitoring air, water, and dust for potential environmental hazards
   <h>o vacuuming dust and debris from streets and other outdoor spaces in
   lower Manhattan
   <h>o removing and disposing of hazardous wastes from the sites
   <h>o creating an online database to report monitoring results to the
   press and the public
   <h>o setting up wash stations and providing protective equipment for
   recovery workers
   <h>o developing a cleaning and testing program for indoor residences in
   lower Manhattan

  <p> "We were just doing our part," says Deputy Regional Administrator
   Muszynski. "We were doing our part, just as the Red Cross was doing
   its part, the way so many support groups were, the way the Corps of
   Engineers was doing its part, the way truck drivers were moving
   material out and doing their part."

   <p>"Beyond the science and the regulation, beyond the standards and the
   benchmarks, EPA is at heart about helping people," says Regional
   Administrator Kenny. "Our employees proved that every day of this
   response."
