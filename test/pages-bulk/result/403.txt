<h>SANTA'S SACK

   <p>In the tradition of heaving stockings, bulging packages and stuffed
   stomachs the contents of this year's Epic Christmas newsletter are
   overflowing. We have added a couple of features including an
   e-learning diary showing the most important dates in the first half of
   2005. Epic will be exhibiting at a number of locations during the
   year, the first of which will be the Learning Technologies show
   starting on January 26th in Olympia, London. Epic will be on stand 62
   - if you would like an invitation to the show please contact us.
   Following on from last month's iPod learning White Paper, this month's
   jamboree publication features a review of downloadable audio files by
   Steve Rayson and Donald Clark has summarised the year's e-learning
   events. As usual, we welcome your comments and suggestions and I would
   like to extend personal thanks for your continued support throughout
   this year. Have a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year - see you
   in 2005.

<h>INTRODUCTION

   <p>1. A short round-up of the year by Donald Clark, Epic

   <p>2004 was the year of the monkey and, true to form, there was a great
   deal of monkey business going on.

   <p>In January we had the now infamous Towards a Unified e-Learning
   Strategy. It was a sort of educational tract/DfES deapartmental plan,
   completely missing the commercial sector. End of January was the
   deadline for responses to the Government's Consultation Document. We
   are still waiting on the results! Someone mentioned February 2005. In
   the meantime, things have moved with informal learning and a dozen
   other market shifts.

   <p>Throughout the year some consolidation was seen in the US, notably the
   Docent and click2learn merger in March. In June Blackboard had hugely
   successful float on NASDAQ, but their competitors such as eCollege,
   Corinthian Colleges and DeVry continue to suffer. In the corporate
   sector we're still waiting on Sumtotal to sort out the merger.
   Skillsoft have stabilised, however poor product perceptions continue.

   <p>In the UK KnowledgePool and ACT went into receivership while the UkeU
   collapsed with a Select Committee grilling the Chair and Chief
   Executive of HEFCE, especially the bonuses for 30 of the 70 staff.
   November saw the NHSU merge down into a new NHS Institute.

   <p>Merry Xmas

                               

                              

<h>WHITE PAPER

   <p>2. Informal Learning

   <p>Informal, casual, instant, spot, embedded or workflow learning is now
   recognised as perhaps the most important form of adult learning,
   quantifiably more important than formal learning interventions. We all
   know that over a lifetime, most of what we learn is not within the
   context of a college, classroom or course. We develop daily through
   natural exploration, exposure and encounters with knowledge and
   people. It has even been described as learning that `takes place at
   subconscious levels' Rusaw (1995).

  

<h>RESEARCH

   <p>3a. A practical guide to accessible e-learning

   <p>Providing accessible e-learning is becoming ever more critical in
   today's marketplace. It is not just a legal requirement, but can
   confer a competitive advantage on the organisations who make the
   effort to ensure that their e-learning is accessible.

   <p>A new report commissioned by the CIPD from Epic depicts the current
   state of play, and provides practical recommendations on how
   organisations should approach this thorny issue. Case studies
   illustrate how some other organisations are going about providing
   accessible e-learning without losing any interactivity or engagement.

   <p>The full report will be available in the next few days for free
   download via the CIPD website (www.cipd.co.uk).

   <p>3b. Workflow Research

   <p>Want to learn? Then stop trying.

   <p>Research released in November 2004 suggests that, in some
   circumstances, we learn best when we are not thinking about something
   too much. Dr Paul Fletcher published his findings in Cerebral Cortex.

   <p>The experiment was very clever involving the pressing of buttons in
   response to screen information. What the learners did not know, was
   that there were hidden sequences. Bizarrely those who simply went on
   to push the buttons did well, even denying that there were any
   sequences. When people were actively looking for the sequence, they
   did not show any evidence of getting faster or better. In fact, it
   appears that explicitly trying to learn obliterates implicit learning.

   <p>What's going on here?

   <p>Their results indicated that the frontal lobes were most active during
   explicit learning, which was when they were looking for the sequence
   but showed least improvement in performance. It was also the case
   that, under this condition, the frontal lobes showed a very different
   relationship with other key brain regions and interacting with them in
   a different way than under circumstances in which subjects were
   performing the task optimally.

   <p>As Dr Fletcher said, 'This study shows that our frontal lobes,
   although thought to be the seat of higher human psychological
   function, may, under certain circumstances, be more of a hindrance
   than a help. That is, as many sportspeople have already discovered for
   themselves, there are certain circumstances under which we should stop
   deliberating and just act.'

   <p>This is an interesting finding and, in a small way supports the idea
   of embedded or workflow learning, as opposed to separate learning
   interventions.

                                                                      top

   <p>3c. E-learning research - University of Sussex

   <p>An interesting source of research in e-learning is the
   www.reveel.sussex.ac.uk site. This provides access and links to good
   research with the research methodology. This is an attempt to separate
   out the significant studies from those that have poor methodologies.

   <p>Several studies on learning effectiveness are of interest including:

   <l>Allen et al (2004)

   <l>Guerandel et a (2003)

   <l>Kekkonen-Moneta (2002)

   <p>On community and connectivity:

   <l>Uschi (2002)

   <l>De Laat & Lally (2004)

   <l>Rovai (2001)

   <l>Kreijns et al (2003)

   <p>There's also a warning about the so-called `grey literature', where
   the research is perhaps serving specific interests.

   <p>On the whole this is a credible site that holds lots of promise.

   <p>3d. ASTD State of the industry

   <p>Research: ASTD State of the Industry Report

   <p>Just released this month, the annual 2004 report has a wealth of data
   on the training industry based on data from 344 US organisations.

   <p>The headlines are:

   <l>1. Learning increasingly linked to performance
   <l>2. E-learning up from 15.4% to 23.6%
   <l>3. Annual training expenditure per employee steady at $820
   <l>4. Time steady at 26 hours per employee

   

<h>INTERVIEW

   <p>4. Given the chance, Epic loves to hear the opinions and experiences
   of influential figures within the learning industry. You may remember
   we ran an interview with John Brown of Ufi Ltd. back in October. This
   month, Lee Maxey, Chief Learning Officer at Pathlore, has generously
   answered our e-learning questionnaire. The questionnaire aims to get
   personal views, rather than general thoughts on the state of the
   market and the questions have been designed acccordingly.

   <h>Introduction by Donald Clark, Epic

   <p>Lee Maxey has been a constant source of inspiration for me. We have
   bumped into each other at many conferences in many cities and I'm
   always amazed at the freshness of his thoughts. One of his most
   endearing habits is his ability to change his mind. Having promoted
   the idea of LCMSs, he now sees them as red herrings. As an American
   who spent his early years in Europe, he can also see things from both
   sides of the pond. His sheer enthusiasm for learning and the internet
   comes through in this interview.

   <p>Q What's your INTEREST in learning/online learning?

   <p>I LOVE learning. My view is that if one is not learning, then one is
   not really living. As a student, competitive athlete, teacher, coach,
   and now as a parent, I continue to be amazed at how different learning
   can be depending on one's perspective. Online learning is not the
   issue as much as one's view of learning as a whole. Having the
   understanding and appreciation of how learning can change one's world
   is far more important than the delivery vehicle for learning.

   <p>Q What interactive technology do you use and have at HOME?

   <p>We have a wireless DSL connection to the internet and a basic TV. We
   don't watch much TV. Our use of the internet ranges from email, to
   shopping, to searches for needed information, to finding kids
   resources.

   <p>Q What stands out as your MOST EFFECTIVE learning experience?

   <p>Wood Badge training for Boy Scout Leaders and flight school training
   to be a pilot were both powerful learning experiences. They both were
   totally immersive, and continue to impact how I think about learning
   today. One was a team-based collaborative experience that involved a
   lot of behavioural and a "soft skill" focus. The other was an intense
   solitary activity with high degrees of precision and procedure.

   

<h>ARTICLE

   <p>5a. Audio Review: Will Wright - Simulation Design

   <p>At Epic we have all been excited recently by the potential of audio
   files and iPods as learning devices. Thus when I came across an audio
   file by Will Wright on www.itconversations.com I downloaded it to my
   iPod and began listening. Will Wright, for those that don't know, was
   the founder of Maxis, the company that created the world's best
   selling PC game The Sims. This is a game that my daughter spends many
   hours playing and hence I was also interested to understand the way
   the game was designed.

   <p>Will is also a very amusing speaker and interesting individual. He
   explained that when he gets a new game the first thing he does is work
   out what you have to do and then do the complete opposite i.e. drive
   the wrong way on a racing game. He also likes his children to
   experiment in the same way and added "do you know that Barbie's hair
   is flammable?" I personally liked his style which made me listen on.

   

   <p>5b.Audio downloads and Podcasting

   <p>www.itconversations.com offers free download audio files of
   conversations with leading people in the IT industry and is just one
   of many sites offering free audio downloads. You might also be
   interested in Podcasting. Podcasting is like subscribing to a set of
   news feeds except that rather than read them on screen you can listen
   at your PC or on an iPod. There are many podcasting feeds you can
   subscribe to at www.ipodder.org. These include regular podcasts from
   US Universities on education and technology. Even the BBC is getting
   in on the act. You can now sign up to the "In our Time" podcast where
   Melvyn Bragg and three guests investigate the history of ideas and
   debate their application in modern life. Just go to
   http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/mp3_podcast.shtml. This
   automatically delivers a new audio file to your PC whenever the BBC
   updates it. Alternatively if you just want to download the file
   manually go to
   http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/mp3.shtml.

   <p>Happy listening!

  

<h>SHOW REPORT

   <p>6. Online Educa Berlin 2004

   <p>Epic's Donald Clark recently spoke at the Online Educa international
   conference in Berlin. Here is his report of the show.

   <p>Online Educa is 10 years old this year and remains the leading
   European e-learning conference with:

     <l>* 1700 registered participants from 60 countries
     <l>* attendees from 63 countries
     <l>* 344 speakers from 43 countries
     <l>* 71 themed sessions

   <p>It's an eclectic mix of researchers, educationalists, corporates and
   policy makers. Note that this doesn't mean any real interaction
   between them. Indeed there were some fractious sessions and more than
   the odd culture clash (more of this later). In many ways this is what
   makes this an interesting event.

   <p>A strong feature of the conference is the short speaker slots. Three
   or four speakers per session means they're limited to about 20 mins
   each. This lowers the odds on boredom, and as the speakers still have
   to pay to attend the quality can be variable. In fact, this year,
   there was some disgruntlement around `presentation skills'.

   
<h>NEWS

   <p>7a. Useful e-learning source

   <p>Schmoller news

   <p>Seb Schmoller has been working away in e-learning for years. His ALT
   organisation is now a large and credible body, but it is his useful
   mailing that I'd like to turn your attention to. If you want useful UK
   news stories and links in e-learning, Seb keeps his eye on the
   e-learning ball. I have personally found this a useful source of
   market and academic information.

   <p>He also reviews our White Papers (fairly and objectively). I should
   add that our decision to make some available without registration was
   his idea.

   <h>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

   <p>7b. Healthcare and e-learning in the US

   <p>Healthcare in the US has surprisingly low levels of training spend
   with many hospitals facing shrinking budgets, an unsophisticated
   infrastructure but a highly technical and diverse audience and 24/7
   operations. However, they have lots of external training requirements
   - especially in health and safety.

   <p>Joint Commission for Accreditation of Healthcare Organisations
   (JCAHO), an accreditation body that requires documented annual
   training. Then there's the Office of Inspector General (OIG) where
   compliance is backed up with huge penalties on fraud and abuse
   allegations. Hospitals therefore need compliance plans and need to
   adhere to National standards. Clinical professionals also need annual
   training. It is imperative that they receive annual training. The Risk
   Management Issues are enormous, especially around professional
   liability and malpractice issues.

  

<h>JOBS!

   <p>8. Job vacancies
