  <h> Comp time bills off target
  <h> Existing labor law already allows the flexibility that employers say
   they want for their workers

   <h>by Lonnie Golden

   <p>The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 is the principal federal law that
   regulates work hours and limits the expansion of the work week. By
   requiring employers to pay a 50% wage premium for work beyond 40 hours
   in a week, the act successfully made a 40-hour work week the norm,
   both legally and culturally. It is, in fact, the original and maybe
   the most important family-friendly law enacted by the federal
   government, since it established the principle that employees should
   have a normal work week short enough to leave ample time for leisure,
   rest, and family.

   <p>Yet employer organizations, which generally opposed enactment of the
   FLSA and have sought to limit or weaken it for more than 60 years, now
   allege that the law itself is somehow an impediment to family-friendly
   work schedules. Since 1995, legislation has been introduced in the
   U.S. Congress to modernize the FLSA by changing the standard work
   week, overtime pay rules, and classifications of exemptions, on the
   presumption that the FLSA has become outdated (Finegold 1998; Abbott
   1999; Wilson 2001; Bird 2000). In particular, bills have been
   introduced (S. 317, the Working Families Flexibility Act, and H.R.
   1119, the Family Time Flexibility Act) that would legalize the
   substitution of compensatory time off for overtime pay in the private
   sector. The Senate bill also proposes establishing an 80-hour standard
   over a two-week work period.

   <p>If the true aim is to benefit working families, such legislation is
   inadequate, poorly targeted, and likely to prove counterproductive.
   Options already exist within the time-honored FLSA that permit
   employees the kind of flexibility in schedules they increasingly
   needflextime, other time-banking schemes such as the compressed work
   week, and the use of comp time within the weekwithout having to first
   put in long, overtime hours. Truly family-friendly amendments to the
   FLSA would bring more workers under its protection, reduce hours of
   work, expand minimum paid-leave times, and limit if not ban mandatory
   overtime.

   <p>Reducing the daily, weekly, and annual hours of those workers who
   prefer shorter working times should be the focus of public policy,
   including FLSA reform. But legalizing compensatory time in lieu of pay
   is more likely to heighten the incidence and severity of
   overemployment, for three reasons. First, such a system intensifies
   the economic incentives for employers to lengthen the number of
   overtime hours scheduled per week (Golden 1997, 1998). By paying no
   cash at all for employees overtime work, and being legally permitted
   to deny use of comp time for a year or more, employers will lower the
   marginal cost of scheduling overtime. Cheapening overtime work
   guarantees that there will be more demandedto the detriment of those
   workers agreeing to the substitution of comp time for pay. Employers
   would effectively receive an interest-free loan from their employees,
   while workers who gave up premium pay would get shortchanged by
   devalued banked comp time (Leibig 2002). Second, if some fraction
   (one-third or more) of the employees banked comp time hours earned are
   either unused or unusable, the employees are likely to wind up working
   longer annual hours than they would have without a comp time program.
   Third, workers schedules will become more volatile and less
   predictable as they work more overtime without gaining additional
   control over their time off.

   <h>The problems of overemployment and inflexible hours in America
   <p>The continuing rise of family work hours and dual-income households
   (Mishel, Bernstein, and Boushey 2003) intensifies the need for more
   family-friendly work schedules. Unfortunately, however, the spread of
   flexible work schedules and voluntary work-at-home arrangements has
   recently stalled (Appelbaum and Golden 2002). And increasingly, the
   work day is spilling over into evenings and weekends (Hamermesh 2000).
   Much of this is uncompensated or unclaimed overtime work (Employment
   Law Alliance 2002).

   <p>A small but growing proportion of workers in the U.S. consistently
   expresses in polls a need for more time for their personal and family
   needs, that is, less time at work. Estimates of the rate of
   overemployment (i.e., working longer hours than the employee desires)
   in the U.S. labor force are scarce and imprecise, but an upward trend
   is discernible from snapshots provided by periodic surveys asking
   people if they are willing to reduce proportionately both their work
   hours and income. The rate of overemployment appears to have risen
   from the levels of 6-9% observed in the 1980s (Shank 1986; Lang and
   Kahn 2001). A Work-in-America Institute (2002) poll found that as many
   as 22% of nonunion (16% of union) workers would accept 90% of their
   current pay for 10% fewer hours. The most credible indicator of change
   comes from the federal governments General Social Survey, which found
   that the percentage preferring fewer hours, even though earning less
   money, rose from 5.7% in the 1988-91 period to 10.3% in 1998. All of
   the estimates cited above might be exaggerations: when push comes to
   shove, an expressed preference for reduced hours might not be acted
   upon once the opportunity arrives, when the reality of a reduction in
   income sinks in. But despite the elusiveness in measurement, the
   salient point is that a significant share of workers lacks the
   flexibility to shorten its work hours.

   <p>The reasons these workers increasingly feel overworked no doubt
   include the fact that Americans, on average, are working longer hours
   both as individuals and, especially, as families. Total weeks worked
   annually by two-income, married-couples have increased from 78 in 1979
   to 98 in 1999. On average, wives in prime-age, married-couple families
   with children worked almost 400 hours more per year in 2000 than they
   did in 1979. One contributor to these longer hours is the increasing
   number of workers who are excluded from the FLSAs overtime
   protections. The share of the workforce exempt from the overtime
   provisions of the FLSA has risen from about 32% in 1978 to 40% in the
   late 1990s (Hamermesh 2000). According to the Department of Labor, 74
   million workers were covered by the FLSAs overtime provisions in the
   year 2000, leaving about 50 million uncovered and unprotected. Only
   20% of covered workers exceed 40 hours a week, while 44% of exempt
   workers work more than 40 hours a week (U.S. GAO 1999). As employers
   succeed in exempting more and more of their employees, average work
   hours and the resulting time pressures on workers and their families
   can be expected to increase even further. Such exemptions promise only
   to widen under the Department of Labors recent recommendations to
   change the longstanding part 541 regulations, which will make it
   easier for employers to exempt as administrative, executive, or
   professional various employees currently covered by FLSA overtime
   requirements.

   <p>In many industries, including transportation, agriculture,
   communications, and mining, more than a quarter of all workers work
   more than 40 hours a week, and they generally work very long hours. In
   10 industries, the average work hours are greater than 40 hours a
   week, even accounting for part-time workers. In all industries, the
   workers who do work overtime tend to work excessive amounts, averaging
   more than 11 hours of overtime a week. In effect those workers, about
   20% of the workforce, work six-and-a-half days a week, leaving little
   free time for themselves or their families.

   <p>When these long hours of work are added to the problems of longer and
   longer commutes to and from work, the time squeeze becomes even
   tighter. From 1990 to 2000, the average commute time to and from work
   increased more than 13% and now exceeds 50 minutes a day.

   <p>The most extreme case of overemployment is that of working mandatory
   (forced, compulsory) overtime. A significant number of U.S. workers
   cannot refuse overtime work, often required with little or no advance
   notice, without facing some sort of reprisal, such as disciplinary
   action, demotion, or even discharge. Estimates of its incidence are
   wide-ranging and sensitive to survey wording. The best available
   recent estimate is that about 18% of the workforce performs
   involuntary overtime work, since a third of the 60% of overtime
   workers in a representative survey reported being compelled by their
   supervisor to work more overtime than they preferred (Cornell
   University Institute of Workplace Studies 1999). Workers employed in
   transportation and emergency health services face more employer
   pressure than others. Another recent survey found that 45% of workers
   reported having to work overtime on little or no notice (Heldrich
   Center for Workforce Development 1999). In the late 1970s, about 16%
   of workers reported that overtime was mainly up to their employer and
   that they would suffer a penalty if they refused it. Involuntary
   overtime was found to be relatively higher among men, blue-collar and
   non-union workers, and workers with medical or pension plans
   (Ehrenberg and Schumann 1984). Finally, a small but non-negligible
   1.4% of the workforce is involuntarily working full time, usually
   employed part-time but actually working a full-time work week. Such
   workers are more likely to be women or college students, and working
   in non-managerial, sales, service, or laborer occupations (Golden
   2002).

   <h>Comp time is not designed to reduce hours worked
   <p>If employers want to reduce their employees work hours, they can do so
   now, without changes in the law, by hiring more employees and
   spreading the work or by better managing the flow of work and getting
   greater productivity from their workers within a 40-hour week. But
   employers have instead been lengthening their employees hours of work
   over the past decades, even while more and more women have entered the
   workforce and productivity has risen dramatically. This process has
   occurred in government, where various forms of comp time are
   permitted, just as surely as it has in the private sector. In fact,
   despite the comp time option, the average employee worked 40.3 hours
   per week in public administration in 2000, longer than the 39.1-hour
   average for all employment.

   <p>The motivating force for these longer hours is that it is generally
   cheaper to require overtime workeven with a 50% premiumthan it is to
   add new employees. The FLSA overtime premium is calculated on the
   employees wage alone, rather than on the total cost of compensation.
   Since social insurance taxes, health benefits, pension and 401(k)
   costs, and other compensation expenses are such a major part of total
   compensation today, the 50% wage premium is much less potent than it
   was in 1938.

   <p>The only sure way to reduce hours would be to set a legal maximum,
   such as 45 hours a week, and enforce it. Another, less-certain
   solution to long overtime hours would be to increase the overtime
   premium and reduce the number of exempt workers. Finally, giving
   workers the right to refuse to work unwanted overtime would reduce its
   prevalence and lead to better compensation of workers who choose to
   accept overtime work.

   <h>Comp time as provided in S. 317 and H.R. 1119 does none of these
   things; it would also do little or nothing to reduce overtime work and
   could actually increase it. The fundamental problem with comp time as
   provided for in the congressional bills is that it requires employees
   to work overtime first in order to have any chance of earning comp
   time off. Moreover, rather than discouraging employers from assigning
   overtime by penalizing it with the overtime premium, the bills
   encourage overtime work by making it free.

   <h>If comp time proposals became lawalternative scenarios
   <p>The best way to understand the ramifications of changing the FLSA is
   to compare likely scenarios under the current and proposed systems of
   overtime regulation in terms of their ultimate impact on both worker
   time off (in number of hours) and worker income. Suppose an employee
   works an extra two hours past his or her regular shift times both on
   Monday and Wednesday, thus putting in 44 hours per week, with four
   hours of overtime:

   <h>Extra hours under current FLSA
   <p>A conscientious employer could pay the overtime that week and then, to
   reward the employee for giving up personal time, could schedule future
   unpaid leave time off, perhaps during slow times. Result: total annual
   hours worked and income received could be the same as under the
   proposed bills, but employees would not have to wait indefinitely to
   be paid for the overtime hours (when they do, they in effect are
   making an interest-free loan to the employer). This arrangement can be
   offered today, with no new rights, duties, paperwork, recordkeeping,
   causes of action, or oversight.

   <p>Alternatively, to avoid having to pay overtime at all, the employer
   could limit the employees hours to 40 for the week by giving the
   employee the afternoon off on Friday.

   <h>Extra hours under congressionally proposed FLSA reforms
   <p>The worker sacrifices premium pay, and the net change in hours worked
   over the year is ambiguousit could go down or up. Indeed, longer hours
   are more likely. Take the case of an employee who works the four hours
   of overtime on a weekly basis. On an annual basis (with two weeks paid
   vacation standard) the employee will work 200 hours of overtime (OT).
   This means that he or she will bank up to 300 hours of comp time (CT)
   over the course of the year. If at the end of the year, half of these
   hours (150) are actually taken in time off (TO) and the other half
   remain in the leave bank, the employee will have worked 50 more hours
   than if he or she were not assigned overtime at all. For an employee
   to actually work fewer hours net, the ratio TO[t] / OT[t] must be
   greater than 1.0, or, put differently, TO must be greater than 2/3 CT.

   <p>Any employee who has an unused comp time balance in excess of
   one-third of their total comp time credits actually gains no
   additional time off in the year under the proposed comp time program.
   Even without reliable, systematic records of comp time banks,
   anecdotal evidence suggests that, among public sector non-exempts or
   private sector exempts, average annual balances among employees often
   exceed one-third of the comp time allotment. In the public sector
   experience, it is precisely the large comp time accruals that lead so
   many government employers to push the use of comp time in order to
   avoid end-of-the-year cash payments for overtime.

   <p>Because overtime work would become both a deferred compensation
   program and an underfunded liability, the deterrent effect of the
   immediate premium payment for overtime would surely be weakened.
   Employers will become more apt to schedule overtime work generally,
   postponing new hiring. Moreover, those workers who opt for comp time
   are precisely the ones who would be the most attractive to place on
   overtime, in particular for short-term-minded employers who are
   looking to restrain costs and boost profits in the current quarter.
   Furthermore, without the current pay premium the supply inducement
   would be weakened, undercutting the willingness of many workers to put
   in overtime. Thus, allowing substitution of comp time for overtime
   threatens to make overtime work both longer and more involuntary.

   <h>Comp time for overtime pay in state and local government
   <p>Proponents of comp time in lieu of overtime pay argue that this
   practice is an employee benefit enjoyed by public sector employees but
   denied to private sector employees. Unfortunately, a lack of data,
   recordkeeping, documentation, or surveys regarding the use of and
   experience with comp time in state and local governments precludes
   verification of the alleged advantages. The purpose of the FLSA
   amendments in 1986 that permitted the public sector to substitute comp
   time for overtime pay (following the Supreme Courts decision in Garcia
   v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority) was largely to protect
   public sector budgets and, ultimately, taxpayers from large overtime
   pay obligations. Indeed, the court, in AFSCME vs. State of Louisiana
   (1998) declared that the purpose of the comp time option was to
   alleviate the financial burden of owing overtime pay.

   <p>Public employers large cash liabilities, when comp time credits build
   up for various state, county, or municipal employees, have led to
   pressures on employees to use or lose their comp time. Court decisions
   have swung back and forth regarding the legality of employers forcing
   employees to use accumulated comp time. In Heaton v. Moore (1994), a
   court struck down the Missouri Department of Corrections policy
   compelling comp time use, deciding that the FLSA amendment implies
   that time off must be consumable by the worker on the workers terms,
   unless an employees use of requested compensatory time would disrupt
   the employers operations.

   <p>In Collins v. Lobdell (1999), however, a California court ruled that
   the FLSA did not prohibit a public employer, again for budgetary
   reasons, from requiring employees to use accrued comp time, even
   though the Spokane Valley firefighters did not want to use it. The
   right of employers to compel their employees to use their comp time
   accruals, even without the employees approval, was solidified by the
   Supreme Courts reasoning in Christensen (originally, Moreau) v. Harris
   County, Texas (2000) (Barnes 2001). Sheriffs deputies complained that
   they had been denied use of their accumulated compensatory time when
   they requested it, forced to use it when they did not request it, and
   suffered retaliation. As the deputies accumulated ever more comp time
   by being scheduled for overtime, the county feared the mounting fiscal
   obligation both to employees who worked overtime after reaching the
   statutory cap on compensatory time accrual and to those with sizable
   reserves of accrued time. The county adopted a policy requiring all
   employees who had accrued a large bank of comp time to schedule time
   off. Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the majority, saw nothing in
   the FLSA that explicitly prohibits employers from scheduling and
   compelling the use of comp time.

   <h>Problems with exporting public sector comp time to the private sector
   <p>Neither the House nor the Senate bill provides any guarantee that the
   worker who chooses comp time will ever be able to take it. But the
   many differences between the private sector and public sector make
   comp time riskier for private sector employees. First, there is the
   real danger of losing comp time accruals in the event of a business
   failure. The U.S. Small Business Administration reports that even in
   the business boom year of 2000, 550,000 employer businesses closed,
   and more than 200,000 were business failures. Employees will have a
   hard time finding lawyers to bring suits against closed businesses;
   they will find it impossible to recover anything from failed
   businesses. Employees will also risk the loss of accrued comp time in
   the event of their employers merger, fraud, or bankruptcy,
   particularly in the case of small and thinly capitalized enterprises.

   <p>Second, because enforcement of the FLSA is so sporadic, the relative
   absence of unions in the private sector leaves employees vulnerable to
   employer abuse. Fewer than 1,000 wage-and-hour inspectors are
   responsible for enforcing the FLSA and a score of other statutes in
   more than 7 million workplaces across the entire nation. To make
   matters worse, there is substantial non-compliance with the existing
   FLSA overtime rules and regulations. In 2001, the Department of Labor
   investigated 31,772 cases of alleged employer violations and ordered
   $134 million in back wages paid to 219,195 employees who had worked
   uncompensated overtime (Bigler 2002). Violations are highest in
   sectors such as construction and nursing homes and residential
   facilities. The third factor making comp time riskier for private
   sector employees is the fact that private sector employers are not
   required by law to provide any paid leave for vacations or sick days.
   Nothing would prevent an employer from reducing or eliminating the
   paid leave it provides now and substituting comp time in its place. To
   earn paid leave, an employee could first be required to work overtime.
   At a Senate hearing in 1997, an employer testifying on behalf of the
   U.S. Chamber of Commerce admitted that he assigns overtime to
   employees on weekends and, if they refuse, forces them to use their
   vacation leave. Fourth, with no civil service protection, private
   employees will be unable to challenge employer denials of comp time
   use on grounds of undue disruption, an employer defense that will be
   far more common in the private sector where work loads are more
   volatile. Fifth, private employers will inevitably be tempted to try
   to increase profits by implementing a comp time system. They will
   discriminate in the assignment of overtime, favoring employees who are
   willing to forego their right to premium pay. Public employers, by
   contrast, have no profit motive to game the system or pressure
   employees to accept comp time.

  <h> Existing comp time in the private sector
   <p>Some private sector organizations already make comp time available for
   some of their exempt staff. The arrangement is instituted largely as
   an employee benefit and reward for going above and beyond the
   understood, albeit informally defined, work week norm for a particular
   job. For example, an employer may have a policy that an employee
   required to return to the workplace or work offsite an extra day on
   the weekend may qualify for a future day off with pay, provided that a
   supervisor determines that such time worked was beyond the normal job
   function. As such, it is at the discretion of the employer to
   determine how many hours employees must work in a work week before
   they are eligible to earn comp time, whether to cap the total amount
   of comp time that an employee can accrue, and whether unused comp time
   will expire after some time limit (such as six months or a year).
   Notably, most such comp time plans do not permit use or cashout of
   comp time credits upon severing of the employment relationship or even
   transfer, so unused comp time is uncompensated. Indeed, South Carolina
   law actually prohibits cash payments to exempt employees for comp time
   earned, and this rule led to problems for one university implementing
   a comp time program. For employees who resigned having accrued
   compensatory time, supervisors had to delay filling vacancies until
   after comp time credits were used up. For terminated employees, unused
   comp time credits were not granted at all. Eventually, the university
   abandoned its formal comp time program (Inside Clemson 1997).

  <h> Conclusions
   <p>The overtime provisions of the FLSA were designed, it is widely
   agreed, to prevent the tendency toward overwork and to spread job
   opportunities by promoting an eight-hour day, five-day work week for a
   traditional household breadwinner. However, the disappearance of the
   breadwinner model, the rise of dual-income households, more diverse
   preferences regarding work weeks, and crumbling boundaries between the
   workplace and other aspects of life suggest the need to re-evaluate
   the FLSA overtime regulations.

   <p>Creating a truly more family-friendly FLSA means pursuing reforms that
   will unambiguously promote a net reduction in worker hours, not just
   an employer-friendly shift in the timing of work with family and
   flexibility on the label. By this measure, the congressional comp time
   bills, S. 317 and H.R. 1119, are not family friendly and will not
   yield more flextime, flexible scheduling, paid time off, or worker
   control of work schedules, despite proponents attempts to market them
   as such (Furtchgott-Roth 1998; Finegold 1998; Abbott 1999; Bird 2000).
   Critics have pointed out that the current bills requirements and
   remedies are far too weak to provide employees any real protection
   from employer coercion, from being forced to take comp time in lieu of
   overtime pay, from discrimination in the allocation of overtime toward
   those who select the comp time option and away from those who prefer
   payand from preferential hiring of those applicants who prefer comp
   time over those who prefer overtime pay (Clark 1996; Golden 1997;
   Walsh 1999; Henke 1999; Linder 2002; Vance 2002; Conti 2002; Leibig
   2002). Given recent court interpretations, the bills inadequately
   protect the right of employees to use the comp time they have earned
   when they need to, since employers are given the right to refuse comp
   time use if the employer deems it an undue disruption of business or
   operations.

  <p> The Senates proposed legislation does create opportunities for
   employers to more closely match employee hours with the annual flow of
   work volume. This may be a worthy objective, but promoting a more
   unstable work week, which allows greater escape from overtime
   compensation, merely reinforces the cost incentive for employers to
   schedule overtime and further erodes the deterrent effect of overtime
   pay.

  <p> Finally, the FLSA comp time bills are not only too one-sided to
   deliver a more family-friendly work week or workplace, they are also
   poorly targeted. Working longer-than-standard hours is concentrated
   among white-collar workers (U.S. GAO 1999) and non-traditional shift
   workers, 72% of whom work at least 100 hours of overtime per year and
   27% of whom work at least 300 hours (Circadian Learning 2002).

  <p> Without pilot programs and empirically gained knowledge of how well
   such a new system might work in terms of delivering shorter average
   hours to workers risking a comp time option, the current system is
   better left alone. A more comprehensive and effective way of
   delivering a truly more family-friendly FLSA would be to incorporate
   or adopt:
     <p>* a protected right to refuse assignment of overtime (see Golden and
       Jorgensen 2002), with a minimum advance notice time for requested
       overtime work;
     <p>* extension of the pay premium regulation to work day length,
       evening/night/weekend work, and annual hours (Hamermesh 2002);
     <p>* coverage extending to those currently exempted, such as certain
       managers and professionals (Jacobs and Gerson 1998; Schor 1994);
     <p>* annual hours limits for salaried non-exempts;
    <p> * creative work-sharing and work-spreading practices (see Appelbaum
       et al. 2001);
     <p>* incentives for employers to offer and workers to accept various
       reduced-hours options (see Bailyn, Drago, and Kochan 2001);
     <p>* prorated benefits by hours worked and reduced bias toward longer
       hours per employee (Golden 1998; Jacobs and Gerson 1998);
     <p>* coverage of currently exempt vehicle drivers, covered at present
       only by Department of Transportation hours-of-service regulations
       that set a maximum of 60 hours per week (and that are widely
       considered to be commonly disregarded);
     <p>* rights to a shorter standard work week, such as 35 hours, for
       workers claiming younger dependents, with a daily overtime premium
       after seven hours.

                                                              <p> April 2003
