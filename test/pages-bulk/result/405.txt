<h>Alesis QS8.1

  
   <h>THE QS8.1: Would the Masters Have Approved?
   <p>Jul 20 '00 (Updated Sep 24 '02)
   <h>Author's Product Rating
   <p>Product Rating: 4.0
   
   <h>Pros
   <p>Excellent value quotient, nice looks, expandable, great sounds with
   ample programming versatility.
   <h>Cons
   <p>Complex user interface with small display, awful tech support (Alesis
   now bankrupt!), no onboard sequencer.
   <h>The Bottom Line
  <p> Unfortunately, Alesis has gone bankrupt, but you can still find many
   of these keyboards at a good price online. It's a good instrument, but
   requires patience.
   <h>Full Review
   <p>It's hard to imagine the composers of yesteryear: armed with just pen
   and paper, the only way to get the musical masterpieces that echoed in
   their minds was by writing it down. If they were lucky, they could
   doodle on a piano to hear more or less what the music sounded like. Of
   course, it was nothing like the ocean of sound a massive orchestra
   could produce. Alas, even today, no machine can truly reproduce "the
   real thing" yet. Even so, keyboards have taken their place as an
   integral part in many forms of music. One day, I had the task of
   choosing one.
   <h>ENOUGH ABOUT YOU, LET'S TALK ABOUT ME:
   <p>Before you hear my impressions, perhaps it would be easier to
   understand my point of view if I briefly explain a few things about my
   musical background.
   I'm trained primarily in the piano (15 years), although I've played
   the cello, violin, and am currently fumbling with guitar. I love all
   forms of music, from classical to electronic. These two classes of
   music that I just mentioned are my main focus of interest as far as
   composition is concerned. Until I got the QS8, I used a Yamaha 510-PSR
   (a $400 machine) to achieve that end. It was fun, but a toy, no more.
   I wanted a serious machine that I could play piano on and compose
   music with. My training in MIDI sequencing was very sparse, and even
   today I'd still consider myself an amateur when it comes to advanced
   MIDI functions.
   <p>I've used this keyboard live on a couple of occasions (playing
   funk/fusion), and it's performed rather well. Usually, however, this
   keyboard sits inside my "makeshift studio" at home.
   <h>ONE MORE THING BEFORE I START!
   <p>I'm not going to bore you with all of the technical details (there's a
   lot) of the QS8. For that, check out the Alesis website. Also, note
   that the model I'm referring to is the QS8, not the QS8.1. There
   aren't any major differences between these two models. Basically, the
   display is a little larger on the QS8.1, and it has two new buttons
   (Transpose and Sequence Select) that make navigation a little easier.
   Alesis also claims that the General Midi sounds on the QS8.1 are
   improved, but I haven't noticed that much of a difference. Other than
   that, the two keyboards are identical.
   <p>Okay, let's get started, shall we?
   <h>DECISIONS, DECISIONS!
   <p>I was in the market for a new keyboard when I got my own apartment a
   couple of years ago. Because I wanted the full "piano experience" in
   addition to having many voices for composition, my search was narrowed
   down to 88-key machines only. This was a problem because the cost rose
   accordingly.
   <p>Ideally, I wanted the Korg Trinity ProX workstation, but at a price
   reaching $3500, it was (and is) way out of my range. My search finally
   brought me down to the Alesis QS8 and the Korg N1. Both were great
   machines, but I chose the QS8 for several important reasons:
   <p>» For starters, the piano sounded good on both machines, but better on
   the QS8. What's more, the action of the keys was much better on the
   Alesis than the Korg. The N1 only has weighted keys, nothing more.
   There is a dead feel at the end of the key travel that isn't great for
   playing fast. The QS8, on the other hand, had simulated hammer action
   in addition to having fully weighted keys.
   <p>» The QS8 is expandable by use of Flash RAM cards or Alesis Q-Cards
   (more later). The N1 had more voices in memory, but was not
   expandable, and didn't even have a floppy drive.
   The only major drawback I could see of the Alesis QS8 was that it had
   no onboard sequencer. That is, I couldn't compose the music on the
   machine itself and had to use an external sequencer. Still, the QS8
   had most of the key ingredients (and was $200 cheaper than the N1), so
   I was sold on it.
   <h>ON THE OUTSIDE:
   <p>The QS8 feels like a heavy booger, but it's relatively light for its
   class. At 55 pounds, it's cumbersome to carry alone, but possible. I
   recommend getting a case if you plan on traveling with it. The surface
   of the keyboard is a rough metal (a wrought iron feel, if you will),
   and two black wooden braces support the frame on either side.
   Fortunately, unlike many other keyboards, the power supply is
   internal, so you won't need to use a huge power adapter to plug into
   the wall. A serial port is in the back of the keyboard's frame for
   hi-speed transfer of files (much faster than traditional MIDI cables),
   and it works in either PC or Mac mode. It's a little expensive, but
   worth it if you do a lot of file swapping with the computer.
   <p>The keys (full size, of course), are designed by Fatar. I've heard
   mixed reviews about these keys. Some swear by them and say that
   they're the highest quality out there. There are those that think
   otherwise. As for me, I've felt more solid keypads, but mine have
   given me absolutely no trouble after years of constant banging and
   trilling. My only complaint is that there's an audible *thud* when the
   keys hit the keypad. It's not that noticeable, though, and really no
   big deal.
   <p>Few buttons grace the QS8, so it's not overly busy or flashy. They're
   also the soft-pad variety, which I don't like one bit. I like the kind
   of buttons that give you a *click* so you know you pressed it hard
   enough. The backlit display on the QS8 is tiny, and not much larger on
   the QS8.1, I might add. All in all, though, I find the aesthetics of
   the QS8 visually pleasing. It's simple yet cleanly attractive.
   <p>The design is tough, from what I can tell. In truth, I've never really
   been tough on my machine, but the keyboard feels sturdy and of good
   quality.
   <h>"THE PIANO-PLAYING EXPERIENCE":
   <p>In my humble opinion, keyboards have a ways to go before they can
   truly emulate the feel and sound of a real piano. That said, the QS8
   does a respectable job at it, with a broad selection of pianos that
   suit many tastes. Although it doesn't feel the exact same as the real
   thing, I absolutely love the simulated hammer action. When you strike
   a key on a real piano, you can feel when the hammer disconnects with
   the keys right before striking the strings. The key bounces right back
   up after the note is played and allows for clean trills and fast
   playing. You can really feel this effect with the QS8, which makes the
   experience all that more real. As I said before, few keyboards on the
   market offer this (not even my beloved Korg Trinity Pro X).
   <p>The piano sounds themselves are very nice, and can be tweaked in a ton
   of ways. I don't particularly like one called "Grand 64" because it
   sounds oversampled... as if the same exact note was duplicated (giving
   that nasty, metallic sound). Still, you can choose from dark pianos to
   bright, good for any musical genre.
   <p>My one complaint with using the QS8 as a piano is that the velocity
   curve isn't exactly right. That is, when you want it to play extremely
   soft it will play too loud, and when you want to play very loud it
   won't. You can tweak the keyboard's sensitivity, but it's nothing like
   the real thing. For example, if you very lightly touch a real piano
   key you will hear nothing because the hammer wasn't hit hard enough to
   strike the string. Do the same on the Alesis and you'll be reminded
   it's not a piano: a note plays softly. In short, it's the little
   nuances of a real piano that I miss when I play the Alesis.
   <h>THE SOUNDS!
   <p>Of course, there's many things the Alesis QS8 can do that a piano
   could only dream of doing. The sound library of 640 voices on the QS8
   is what makes it possible. There are three Preset banks, one General
   Midi bank, and one User bank. All of these banks are found in a
   "Program" library. The Preset banks are a bunch of factory programs
   made from sounds on the keyboard's 16 megabytes of ROM (each program
   can be made of up to four sounds). These Preset programs cannot be
   altered. However, the User bank has 128 programs that can be altered
   or completely deleted and started from scratch. Although I'm not a
   MIDI programmer, making voices is pretty fun once you get the hang of
   it.
   <p>In addition to the "Program" library of sounds, there is a "Mix"
   library, where you can mix up to 16 programs as one (or split them,
   etc.). The keyboard has 64-voice polyphony. If we do the math, that
   means you could mix 16 different programs, each with up to four sounds
   making them. Of course, that's probably more than I'll ever need, but
   it's nice to know my keyboard is capable of it.
   I'll break down the musical sound groups individually, because they're
   pretty important:
   <p>Pianos and organs: As I said before, the pianos are very nice, and can
   be used adequately in pretty much any musical style. The organs are
   fantastic, in my opinion. They are great for classic rock songs,
   gospel, or blues. Just my luck, that's not the stuff I compose with.
   They should sound awesome live, however.
   <p>Strings: In context (with other instruments), they're okay, but be
   careful using them on their own. They don't sound right at all.
   Individual instruments, with the exception (maybe) of the cello sound
   downright awful and I never use them.
   <p>Brass: Once again, these sound okay if played in context. Some of them
   sound too shrill, others are too muffled.
   <p>Winds: These can be played by themselves nicely. The oboe sounds
   cheesy, though. There are nice ensemble presets, however, that sound
   almost real when played in context.
   <p>Synth: There is a very impressive array of synth sounds. Some of them
   are "fillers" (just thrown in) but others are way cool. There's a lot
   of emphasis on lead voices, which means there's no polyphony (play
   only one note at a time). I still don't think the sounds are as
   imaginative as those found on the Korg machines, but they're good.
   <p>Drums: The drums sound great by themselves and awesome in context. My
   only complaint is there is no classical percussion.
   <p>All in all, the sounds are nice, but there's one thing that bugs me:
   they are geared much more to the synth side of the spectrum than the
   orchestral side. This makes the keyboard great for stuff like
   techno/dance or rock and roll, but not the best for composing
   concertos or movie soundtracks. Again, the sounds are all pretty good,
   but when you listen to the five rather "synthy" demos on the keyboard,
   you know where the emphasis is.
   <h>EXPANDABILITY:
   <p>You can use one of two methods for expanding the sound memory, or both
   at the same time. The QS8 has two slots for two memory cards,
   described below. Because you already have 16 MB of sound ROM, and can
   add two cards qith 8 MB each, the QS8 is expandable to 32 MB of sound
   ROM, which is a lot. Here's the two methods you could try...
   <p>The first is Flash Ram cards, which are good for creating and burning
   your own sounds. You can also import sounds of different formats using
   the CD-ROM that comes with the QS8. Also, you can burn whole songs on
   these cards, so you can leave your computer at home in a live
   situation. The problem here is that Flash Cards are expensive, and
   they must be compatible with the keyboard.
   <p>If you don't want to go that route, the second option are the Alesis
   Q-cards. These are pretty much Flash ROM cards that have the sounds
   made for you, specifically tailored to a musical genre. The Alesis
   Q-cards are as follows:
   <p>Classical Q-card: For classical music (duh). Bought it on eBay and
   have been very happy with it, though I expected better pipe organ and
   string sounds.
   <p>Eurodance Q-card: I own it (bought thru eBay, which is the best way to
   do it), and like it a lot. It has way cool voices and neat drum loops.
   <p>Sanctuary Q-card: For "spiritual" music and church hymns.
   <p>Hip Hop: Neat bass grooves and drums (I've heard 'em).
   <p>Vintage Keyboards: Emulates many analog organ sounds.
   <p>Vintage Synths and Classic Beatboxes: Imitates the old synths and drum
   machines.
   <p>Latin Q-card: I heard a salsa sample with this card, and it sounded
   very neat!
   <p>Rap/Techno/Dance: Only 4MB on this card. Discontinued, although you
   might still find it on eBay.
   <p>I may have left a couple out, but I think you can appreciate the
   variety of extra sounds you can have access to. The cards vary in
   cost, but are all over $150. Buy them on eBay for cheap!
   <h>USER INTERFACE:
   <p>Oh, boy... watch out. This is the Achille's heel of the QS8.
   Unfortunately, with so few buttons and such a small display,
   navigation is far from obvious. I've had to read the manual almost
   cover to cover. Luckily, the manual is very complete, and even teaches
   you about MIDI, its history, and how to manipulate it.
   Plus, the versatility of the keyboard is very good. You can adjust up
   to six parameters of a voice (like chorus, volume, reverb, vibrato,
   leslie, lo-pass, hi-pass, etc.) at once using the four control
   sliders, the pitch wheel and the modulation wheel. Each of these
   controllers can be programed to any effects that you want.
   <p>Still, you just might find yourself tearing your hair out from being
   trapped in submenus trying to do so.
   <h>SEQUENCING:
   <p>Well, Achilles had two heels, didn't he? Here's Achille's heel number
   two. As I said, there is no onboard sequencer on the Alesis. So,
   you'll need to connect to a computer and use some sequencing software.
   This was also far from obvious to me, although at the time I was a
   beginner. However, sometimes I'm still a little befuddled with the
   interface and sometimes I've been overcome with laziness and stopped
   my composing out of fatique. If you compose a lot and aren't that
   well-versed at sequencing with software, I advise you to consider
   another keyboard. It's the source of much frustration, and the manual
   tells you very little about it.
   <h>PROGRAMMING:
   <p>If it weren't for the complicated menus and such, the Alesis would be
   an ideal machine for this. A great number of parameters can be changed
   of each sound in a voice, so you can tweak sounds to be as classical,
   techno, or rock as you can.
   <p>The effects are equally impressive. You can do just about anything
   with them. The great part is that there are up to four effects buses.
   That means you can add bass to a drum, reverb to a piano, leslie to an
   organ, and vibrato to a trumpet all at the same time. They can also be
   modified in a live situation using the control sliders and wheels once
   they've been programmed.
   <h>CUSTOMER SUPPORT:
   <p>Absolutely terrible. I had e-mailed Alesis numerous times about my
   sequencing woes, and received no answers. I called, only to be put on
   hold for a half hour, and was met with a very brusque representative
   who taught me nothing. I guess my problem was too basic for them, I
   guess. I had to learn on my own, and it wasn't easy for me. I have
   them to thank for that "character-building" experience!
   <h>THE VERDICT: AFTER A FIERCE STRUGGLE, IT'S A FUN MACHINE & A GREAT
   VALUE.
   <p>For what you get, the QS8 certainly has a great bang-for-the-buck
   quotient. It has given me hours and hours of fun and inspiration, but
   also frustration and confusion. Once you get over that rather steep
   learning curve, however, this keyboard is a blast. Still, I can't help
   but wonder how things would have been if I bought the Korg N1 or
   waited for something else. That's due to my musical tastes, mind you,
   because this is indeed a quality instrument.
   <p>If you don't want to have to deal with the complexity of the machine
   or you can spend more, I strongly suggest you buy something else.
   Heck, get a Korg Trinity Pro X in my name (or the new Triton). If
   you're on a tighter budget and consider yourself to be extremely
   patient, I say go for the Alesis QS8 (or QS8.1).
   <p>Recommended:
   <p>Yes
