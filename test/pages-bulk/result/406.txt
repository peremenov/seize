                      <h>I was born September 30,1955 at
                     11:07 P.M. weighing 6 lbs 11/4 oz.
                      <h>I've gained weight sincethen....

   <p>This is a collection--in no particularorder--of my weight at different
   ages. As you'll see, my body weight wasa defining and persistently
   pervasive part of my life from a very earlyage.

   <p>I am the fat daughter of a fatwoman who desperately wanted to save me
   from the pain she'd suffered asa child, including the taunts and
   hateful messages of inadequacy and undesirabilitythat came from her
   mother.

   <p>These words are written to documentmylife experience as a chubby
   child, fat teenager, and super-sized adult.There is no blame, and I am
   not angry at my Mother...This is Mystory, and I think it needs to be
   told. For those of you who arenot, and/or never have been fat, the
   numbers alone may not provide enoughinformation or insight. Wherever
   possible, I am including childhood pictureswhich can be viewed by
   clicking on my age at the beginning of the paragraph.I will add
   pictures over time as I find and scan them.

   <p>Please keep my story in mindwhen judging yourself, or someone you love
   (which actually, should be oneand the same;-) Teach yourself, and the
   fat people in your life that theirvalue should not be determined by
   their body shape, size or any of a hundredother variables. Learn to be
   beautiful, smart and strong on the insidefirst.This will radiate from
   your center regardless of your physical size, andeveryonewill know how
   beautiful you are!

   <p>If you'd like to see how I startedout, click hereand I will share a
   few pictures of myself as an infant and toddler.

   <p>Age 5: We lived in garden apartments,and an older boy of 7 named Kevin
   called me fat. Someone told methat he drew a picture of me in chalk on
   the front of the brick building.It was a crude stick figure with a
   circle for the head and a larger bubblefor the body. That's the first
   time I remember being called fat.

   <p>Age 7: During a trip to the doctorfor my usual earache problems, it is
   decided that I should be put ona diet. I don't recall my exact weight,
   but what I do remember isgoing home with a piece of paper which
   inspired my Mom to give me a bowlof Wheaties with skim milk and no
   sugar for dinner. The rest ofthe family had steak, or hamburgers. I
   was markedly different fromthis moment on.

   <p>Age8: 88 lbs, I think. I have a clear, but distant memory of being
   atmy cousin Selma's country home, and she gives me a pair of shorts to
   tryon. They don't fit, and she tells me that a little girl my age
   shouldn'tweigh this much, and that if I lose 40 lbs she will buy me
   all the newshorts I want...I adore Selma, so I promise to do
   it--because eventhough I'm sure she loves me, I'm somehow certain that
   she'll love me moreif I'm not chubby. During this same year, I also
   had diet pills for thefirsttime.

   <p>Age9: 121 lbs. Mrs Wise's fourth grade class is lined up outside the
   nurse'soffice at Ridge Ranch School in Paramus, NJ. We are being
   weighed, andwhen it's my turn, I am logged at 121 lbs. The nurse
   points out that Iweigh more than even the biggest and strongest boys
   in the school. I hearsome of the boys in my class laughing and
   exclaiming "Wow, what a tub oflard--Mason weighs over a hundred
   pounds!" This fact is mentioned muchmore often than the fact that I
   learned a monologue in Norwegian--aswell as designing and creating the
   scenery for the class play--a feat Ipersonally found much more
   impressive.

   <p>Age 10: 131 lbs. My Mother takesme to Dr Di Donato because I have an
   earache. Of course, I am weighed (earinfections are directly linked to
   fatness, right?) and when the doctorcomes into the examination room,
   he shakes his head in disgust and exclaims,"131 pounds! My nurses
   don't weigh that much!!!" I am humiliated, lookingto my Mother for
   comfort--who in turn looks at the doctor and says, "Doctor,didn't you
   know? Susan is going to be wearing my clothes to schoolthis fall!" The
   doctor seemed to ignore my Mother's remark, but says "We'vegot to do
   something about her," as though I were not even present. I wasgiven
   diet pills again, and I remember later that year telling myteacher
   that I wasn't taking them, but flushing them down the toilet. Iwas
   proud of that, having read that diet pills can be dangerous...but
   Idon't think she saw it that way, and though I'm not certain, I think
   shemight have called my parents and told them. Was I clairvoyant, or
   simply"too smart for my own good?"

   <p>Age 11: 156 lbs. My sixth gradeteacher was Miss Fowler, who was a
   bastion of strictness. She kept me afterschool one day to talk to me
   about the Girl Scouts--from which I'd justresigned. Miss Fowler told
   me that I was bright and talented, and oh, yeah--Ihad "such a pretty
   face," but I had to lose weight...

   <p>Age12: 166 lbs. Before school started, my Mom took me shopping for
   back-to-schoolclothes. She held up a dress for my approval. I gasped
   and said "I'm notreally that wide!" My Mother replied, "Yes, you are.
   We rarely seeourselves as we really are...the way everyone else sees
   us.

   <p>It's my first year in JuniorHigh School. Mr. Cirinelli is my homeroom
   teacher, and he takes it uponhimself to mentor me in "You'd better
   lose that weight now, 101."Hehas just lost 66 lbs on Weight Watchers,
   and encourages me to join. So,I join the teen group of Weight Watchers
   that meets in the lunchroom ofAlexander's Department Store on Friday
   nights. That first night, they weighme and give me a report card which
   logs my weight and progress and alsodisplays my goal weight, which is
   88 lbs. The woman who weighs me in says"You have to lose a whole
   person!" I was very gung-ho for a while, butslipped up--no, I cheated!
   Mr. Cirinelli warned that I was goingto ruin my life if I didn't lose
   weight, and my Mother told me that itwas more important for me to
   stick to the diet than for her...my wholelife was ahead of me, but
   hers was already settled. She was 42.

   <p>Age13: I'd just survived the most interesting summer of my younglife.
   My parents sent me to diet camp in upstate New York. I was almost200
   lbs, but can't recall the exact number. I'd never been to
   sleep-awaycamp before, but I willingly went so that I could transform
   my life andguarantee my future happiness through weight loss.

   <p>The short version of this storyis that the camp was a broken down
   hell-hole, and I responded appropriatelyto this situation with Civil
   Disobedience, a cornerstone of 60's politicsfor change! The result? I
   was expelled from diet camp. The camp directorcalled my Mother and
   said "You've got to come and get her...she's got herwhole bunk on
   strike...girls are refusing to come to meals or go to activities.Susan
   has turned this place upside down and disrupted the entire camp!"

   <p>I was thrilled to be leaving.I swore I'd stick to my diet and make my
   parents proud. It had been thelongest four weeks of my life, and it
   wasn't until we were a few hoursaway from the camp that my Mother
   turned to me in anger and said "We didn'tcome to get you because we
   love you so much. We came because the camp director,Selma Ettenberg
   said you'd disrupted the entire camp, and they could notget things
   under control until you were gone!"

   <p>On the surface, I was devastatedand embarrassed...but underneath, I
   was smiling. It was my first tasteof power, and I knew that I had been
   right!

   <p>Age 14: 257 lbs. My freshmanyear in high school, and the school nurse
   weighs me in at 257 lbs. I'dbeen admitted to Bergen County Vocational
   & Technical High School inHackensack, NJ. My entrance exam scored in
   the top 10%.  My plan wasto study commercial art...but my memories of
   diets and fat-bashing aremuch more vivid than anything I accomplished
   in my academic career--includingribbons won in a national Teen Arts
   Festival, and a very successful performancein a one-act play
   competition.

   <p>After the sudden death of a belovedsecond cousin from cancer, I was
   determined to lose the weight "so Martywould be proud of me." That was
   my first go-round with Dr. Stillman.Hamburgers, hot dogs, hard-boiled
   eggs and cottage cheese, plus 8 glassesof water a day. I lost about 30
   lbs or so before I faltered.

   <p>Age16: 311 lbs. In an obesityclinic at Hackensack Hospital, I weigh in
   at 311 lbs. The nurse in chargeof my case is very nice. I like her a
   lot, and she convinces me that Ican do this--maybe even lose enough
   weight for someone to ask me to theprom next year. How sad...after
   all, I didn't know that self-esteem wouldhave gone a long way in
   making me desirable. As usual, I lose some weight,but it's never
   enough.  This is also the year that I auditioned forthe part of Mama
   Rose in Bergen Tech's production of "Gypsy."  Despitea standing
   ovation for my audition, I didn't get the part--because of myweight.
   I was told that I just didn't fit the image of Mama Rosebecause of my
   size.  Oy.

   <p>Age 17: 321 lbs. Our family belongedto a camping club, and one of the
   people from the Jersey Skeeters wasa woman named Carol. She was well
   over 300 lbs, with a husband and childrenwho adored her. Suddenly
   during the last year or so, she got thin. On WeightWatchers, of
   course...so now that I had my drivers license, I joined theclass that
   Carol lectured. She told me how much everyone in the class adoredme,
   and how much the rest of the world would, too--once I'd lost the
   weight.She wanted to make a giant poster of my "report card" to
   motivate me andhelp the class monitor my progress. Duh. Can you say
   "Make an exampleof me, and humiliate me any way you can?" A couple of
   months, and Iwas gone!

   <p>Age 17 3/4: 356 lbs. My Motherworked at Castro Convertibles in
   Paramus, NJ. She was their first femalesalesperson, and she was fat.

   <p>One day, I'm in the store tosee her, and I notice this man watching
   me. I didn't like the way he waslooking at me, but I ignored him
   because I was in my Mom's place of business.

   <p>That night, she tells me thestrange man was Bob, and he'd taken an
   interest in me because he'd lostover a hundred and fifty pounds on
   Weight Watchers. So...a few days afterhigh school graduation, I join
   yet another Weight Watchers group and weighin at 356 lbs. Bob assures
   me that if I do the right thing, I'll lose weightand someday, maybe
   even have a boyfriend. If I don't, I'll never be happy.

   <p>Age 19: 375 1/2 lbs. I am acceptedfor participation in an obesity
   research program at The New York StatePsychiatric Institute at
   Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York City.Behavior modification,
   incarceration and the fear of being integrated with,or mistaken for a
   member of the general psychiatric population--Thesewere a few of my
   favorite things.

   <p>I stayed for the better partof six months and lost 88 1/2 lbs. I was
   under 300 lbs for the first timesince the age of 16...

   <p>Age 20?: 375ish...again. Followingan automobile accident and serious
   back injury, I land in a drug rehabin Miami, FL on May 20, 1976
   because my Mother has convinced them thatmy compulsive eating is
   comparable to chemical abuse. I'm admitted becausethe paperwork goes
   through, and the program gets the bucks.

   <p>This place makes the diet camplook like paradise. The food is
   horrendous, the facility (an old moteljust a block off of Biscayne
   Bay) is roach infested, and worse...and aself-imposed regimen of
   arbitrary fasting is easy. Yeah, I lostweight. And then I regained
   it...

   <p>Age 22/23: Still in Miami, nowworkingin the program. One of the
   directors decides that I have to lose weightto set an example for our
   clients, so under the threat of "lose weight,or lose your job," I go
   to Mount Sinai Hospital on Miami Beach and enrollin the Optifast
   Program.

   <p>David Kudzma, my doctor is verycool. He's searing, sarcastic and
   taunts me, telling me I'll never succeed.I did though...I lost 67 1/2
   lbs, and he admitted that he might havebeen wrong. In the long run, he
   wasn't. And I already had the seeds ofanorexic and bulimic behaviors
   planted within me. I wasn't drinking my5 packets a day, thinking that
   somehow if I cut the 350 calories a dayin half, I'd lose more
   weight...faster. I ended up in the hospital afternearly passing
   out--repeatedly over a period of a week or so. I was tooweak to drive
   to the hospital, so a friend brought me. I keeled over inDr. Kudzma's
   office. I remember "spiraling" toward the floor, and the nextthing I
   remembered was wondering how, if I was on the floor, the ceilingseemed
   so close...(I was actually being wheeled to the emergency room ona
   gurney. I never asked, and don't think I want to know how they got
   meup off of the floor.)

   <p>Once I'd recovered from whatwas referred to as an "unknown viral
   thing," I am determined to resumemy diet. I beg for an appointment
   with a staff surgeon who will performa gastro-intestinal bypass on me.

   <p>The surgeon tells me about allof the risks, presumably to scare me,
   but I am not afraid. "I am goingto die anyway," I tell him. "Just do
   it." He refused. I'll bet that's arecord, huh? His name was Dr.
   Ackroyd and he was at Mount Sinai, too. Ihated him that day...but if I
   could thank him now, I would.

   <p>Age 24: 433 lbs. I couldn't believeI'd broken the 400 pound mark, and
   with the blessing of the doctor by whomI was employed, I embarked on a
   high protein, low carbohydrate diet. Whenthat didn't yield long
   lasting results, I had my jaws wired shut. I lostabout 22 lbs in 8
   weeks. Every morning, I beat a raw egg into a glass oforange juice. I
   don't know how I survived--physically, or emotionally.One of the
   things one must do when their jaws are wired is keep a pairof wire
   cutters handy in case the victim--er, dieter, that is, begins tovomit.
   The wires must be cut to avoid choking on ones own vomit. (If
   thisfrightens or makes you uncomfortable, good. It ought to. I wish
   I'd beenfrightened instead of desperate.)

   <p>I had to have the wires cut tohave emergency dental surgery, and chose
   not to get them re-wired. A yearor so later, I asked a dentist to
   remove the braces because I had no intentionof being re-wired, and he
   refused at first. He wanted me to reconsider--andhe wasn't even the
   one who'd put them in!

   <p>Age 25: 450-500 lbs (approximately)I couldn't weigh myself, but this
   is a fair estimation.

   <p>Age 26: 425 lbs on the morningof my Gastroplasty surgery.

   <p>Age 27: 321 lbs, and I am nowanorexic and bulimic. Yes, really! I
   know, because I watched all the talkshows and read the books. The
   symptoms said that someone suffering fromthese eating disorders is
   often emaciated, (but not always) The real keywas, and is behaviors!
   I'm not talking here about "behavior modification,"or discipline. I'm
   talking about the self-destructive, self-loathing behaviorsthat
   destroy our bodies and our souls. Self-Esteem is the Penicillin
   thatkeeps these destructive obsessions with dieting and airbrushed
   physicalperfection at bay.

             <p>Age44: 420 or so (give or take a few pounds,) but
                           does it really matter?

            <p>Thoughts, feelings, comments?Let me know
