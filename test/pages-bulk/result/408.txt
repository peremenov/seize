    <h> amputation: Early infection intervention can save feet & legs

<h>Diabetes patients may benefit most from minor surgery plus antibiotics

   <p>ANN ARBOR, Mich. -- A small sore on a toe may not seem like a major
   medical threat. But for the millions of people who have diabetes and
   other conditions, it can be the first step on a road that leads to the
   amputation of a foot -- or even a leg.

   <p>Now, a new study from the University of Michigan Cardiovascular Center
   may help more people save their limbs. Published in the June issue of
   the Annals of Surgery, it's the first-ever large study of how
   foot-bone infection, called osteomyelitis, is typically treated and
   how well the different approaches work.

   <p>Because diabetes interferes with the body's ability to heal, even the
   smallest foot wounds can become infected, spread to the bone, and lead
   to an amputation. Poor circulation and numb feet, also common in
   people with diabetes, make the situation worse. More than 80,000 such
   amputations happen each year in the United States. Experts already
   recommend that people with diabetes take special care of their feet
   and have regular foot exams to spot problems early.

   <p>The study is the first large account of the prevalence, treatment
   characteristics and high cost of treating osteomyelitis, which
   interferes with walking and sends thousands of people to the hospital
   each year.

   <p>On average, it shows, patients stayed in the hospital for about a week
   at an average cost of $19,000. Almost one in every thousand
   hospitalizations may be due to foot osteomyelitis, the study suggests.

   <p>"This study grew out of our own observations that many osteomyelitis
   patients were being treated for months or even years with antibiotics,
   but not healing, and this can contribute to the loss of their foot or
   leg," says lead author Peter Henke, M.D., an assistant professor of
   vascular surgery at the U-M Medical School. "But there's little
   evidence to guide treatment, so we wanted to look at epidemiology and
   outcomes. Our results show this is a common, costly issue that needs
   much further study."

   <p>Henke and his colleagues performed the study using data from the
   Nationwide Inpatient Sample, a database of hospital patient
   information maintained by the federal Agency on Health Care Research
   and Quality. They also used data from 237 osteomyelitis patients
   treated at the University of Michigan. Both sets of data were from
   patients treated between 1993 and 2000.

   <p>In all, the national data showed that 8.5 percent of patients
   hospitalized for foot osteomyelitis had a leg or foot amputated, and
   23 percent had a toe amputated. About 1.6 percent died before leaving
   the hospital. Patients who were older, African American or had kidney
   problems were more likely to have an amputation.

   <p>Of the U-M osteomyelitis patients, 80 percent had diabetes, and 30
   percent had chronic kidney problems. Nearly 40 percent also had
   blockage in the blood vessels of their legs, a condition called
   peripheral vascular occlusive disease. Nearly a quarter of the
   patients died within 31 months of their hospital stay.

   <p>"This is a patient population in which a non-healing foot wound
   becomes an ulcer, exposes the bone, and leads to osteomyelitis," says
   Henke.

   <p>About half of the U-M patients had been on antibiotics before being
   hospitalized, many of them on intravenous doses of the drugs. On
   average, patients had been on antibiotics for five months, and 30
   percent had had more than one course of antibiotics prescribed to them
   before being admitted.

   <p>However, U-M patients who had been on antibiotics before they entered
   the hospital were much less likely to heal -- perhaps because the
   bacteria in their infected wound had grown resistant to antibiotics.

   <p>Those who had been on antibiotics for a long time before
   hospitalization were also less likely to keep their limbs, possibly
   because the non-healing infection spread too far to allow the foot or
   leg to be saved. The national data did not include pre-hospital
   antibiotic use.

   <p>But the patients who had blood vessel reconstruction to improve
   circulation in their legs and feet were several times more likely to
   have successful wound healing and to keep their foot or leg. Toe
   amputees were also more likely to keep their limbs.

   <p>Patients who had clogged leg blood vessels -- the condition known as
   peripheral vascular occlusive disease or PVOD -- before their
   hospitalization were far less likely to keep their legs or feet over
   time. The patients in the study, Henke notes, were younger and more
   likely to have diabetes than the typical PVOD patient, but had a
   higher than usual risk of losing a foot or leg.

   <p>"This study suggests that antibiotics alone are not as effective as
   surgery plus antibiotics, both for healing wounds and saving limbs,"
   says Henke. "It also suggests that diabetic patients, especially those
   with PVOD, have a very high chance of developing osteomyelitis -- and
   that these patients should be considered for aggressive arterial
   reconstruction or other early intervention. This also really drives
   home the need for good foot care for all patients with diabetes."

   <p>Among the steps recommended for all people with diabetes are to
   examine their feet daily for any signs of redness, blisters, cuts or
   sores; to wear well-fitting shoes and protect their feet from injury;
   and to remove their shoes and socks at each diabetes-related checkup
   so feet can be examined

   <p>The researchers also find that patients whose wounds didn't heal, and
   those who didn't receive early surgical intervention, were much more
   likely to use home-health services after leaving the hospital. This
   kind of care, and outpatient visits, must also be considered when the
   costs of osteomyelitis are tallied, says Henke. But since surgery can
   decrease the need for outpatient visits, it may also help reduce costs
   of caring for a non-hospitalized osteomyelitis patient.

   <p>Because the U-M study was performed using retrospective data, the
   authors say a large prospective study comparing antibiotic use with
   surgical therapy will be needed to confirm their results before they
   have an impact on clinical care.
