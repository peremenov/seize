       <p>The Eurofighter Typhoon benefits from a number of advances in
      technology and engineering. The aircraft makes extensive use of
     composites in the airframe with only 15% of the surface comprising
       metal. The newly developed EJ200 powerplants combined with the
   aircraft's aerodynamics allow it to cruise supersonically without the
   use of reheat for extended periods of time even with a normal weapons
     load. The advanced flight control system and pitch unstable design
    impart great manoeuvrability at high and low speeds. These, combined
     with; cutting edge automated defences, advanced active and passive
        sensors, leading cockpit ergonomics and a reduced RCS instil
     Eurofighter with more than an even chance of success against most
                            competing aircraft.

    <p>Beyond present and near-future threats a key feature of Eurofighter
    development has been a committment to future enhancement of all its
    systems, the so called Capability Enhancement Programme. Most of the
    aircrafts systems are specifically designed to be easily swapped out
   and replaced in future years. This should enable the Typhoon to remain
   competitive as improvements in technology and reductions in cost allow
   the fitting of more advanced equipment. Many of these potential system
                     upgrades are covered on this site.

                         <h> OpEval

      <p>The Eurofighter project has been subject to several operational
      evaluations. These have been carried out, independently from the
      Eurofighter consortium, primarily by Britain's DERA, the Defence
     Evaluation and Research Agency (now split into QinetiQ and DSTL).
    Unlike many previous theoretical operational capability studies, the
     Eurofighter analysis utilised a true simulation approach. This was
    achieved through a number of networked battle simulation computers,
         termed JOUST, each of which can be flown by human pilots.

   <h>BVR Combat Rating
   <l>F-22 Raptor rating : 91% [1.61kB] 91%
   <l>Typhoon rating : 82% [1.4kB] 82%
   <l>Rafale rating : 50% [1.32kB] 50%
   <l>F-15C rating : 43% [1.23kB] 43%
   <l>F-18+ rating : 25% [1.15kB] 25%
   <l>F-18C rating : 21% [1.2kB] 21%
   <l>F-16C rating : 21% [1.21kB] 21%

      <p>This system was used to comprehensively evaluate the BVR (Beyond
      Visual Range) performance of the Eurofighter and other aircraft
      against an upgraded Su-27 Flanker (comparable to an Su-35 Super
   Flanker and its equivalents). The studies investigated all aspect best
      performances from the major systems on each aircraft; avionics,
     structure (including RCS data), engine performance (including fuel
   usage), defences and man-machine interfaces. In these tests the French
    Rafale utilised the Matra-BAe MICA air to air missile (which is the
     primary AA weapon of the French airforce) while the other aircraft
                      used the Raytheon-Hughes AMRAAM.

    <p>These simulations concluded that Eurofighter has a win rating of 82%
     (100% equals always win, 0% equals always lose, 50% equals parity)
    against the target aircraft. A more typical way to present this data
    is as a combat exchange ratio, for the Typhoon this equals 4.5:1. In
   other words statistically one Eurofighter would be lost for every 4.5
    Su-35 fighters shot down. This compares extremely favourably to the
    other aircraft (see also the BVR Combat Rating table); F-16C Falcon
    (0.3:1), F-15C Eagle (0.8:1), F-18C Hornet (0.3:1), F-18+ (0.4:1, NB
      this is not the current F-18E/F which is apparently a downgraded
    version of the F-18+ used in the studies) and Dassault Rafale (1:1).
   Only the LM/Boeing F-22 Raptor bettered the Eurofighter's performance
                  with a combat exchange ratio of 10.1:1.

    <p>In addition to these overall combat performance results a number of
        individual comparisons have been made available. Of enormous
   importance for BVR combat is acceleration at medium altitudes and here
   the Eurofighter's acceleration at Mach 0.9 and 22,000ft equals that of
       the F-22. At supersonic velocities (Mach 1.6 and 36,000ft) the
   sustained turn rate of the Eurofighter betters all but the F-22, while
   its instantaneous turn rate is superior to the F-22. At low altitudes,
       Eurofighter can accelerate from 200kts to Mach 1.0 in under 30
       seconds. In a similar vain to its supersonic performance, the
   sustained and instantaneous subsonic turn rates of the Eurofighter are
   bettered only by the F-22. Only the Rafale comes close to the matching
            the Eurofighter's capabilities in these comparisons.

    <p>An important point to keep in mind when examining this data is that
    full details on the simulations have not been released. Without this
      information it is not possible to determine whether Eurofighter
    optimal profiles were examined at the expense of more varied combat
     missions. However these studies do give some indication as to the
                         potential of the Typhoon.

    <h> National Evaluation

    <p>When selecting a fighter aircraft national airforces have to compare
       and contrast numerous criteria; technological, operational and
   political. This section gives you some idea of how changing the basic
   requirements of a fighter can effect the selection process. Of course
   in practice a fighter is chosen on more than some simple estimation of
    performance of a few key indicators. The recent South Korean process
   is a good example of how other factors can override any decision based
               purely on technical and compatibility grounds.

     <p>Please note the method of defining each aircrafts capability for a
     given criteria is purely empirical, being manually estimated from
    available data, reports and other factors. We bear no responsbility
      should a national airforce use this application to select their
                             fighter aircraft!
              <h>Criteria       <h>Percent        <h>Criteria        <h>Percent
             <l>Twin Seat         ___      <l>Thrust to Weight      ___
            <l>Twin Engines       ___    <l>Air to Ground Combat    ___
              <l>Stealth          ___     <l>Air to Air Combat      ___
               <l>Range           ___          <l>Agility           ___
         <l>Electronic Warfare    ___      <l>STOL capability       ___
                <l>Cost           ___        <l>Maintanence         ___
          <l>Weapon selection     ___        <l>Supercruise         ___
                              

   <p>As you can see, even a simple analysis can result in some significant
   differences in the selection depending on which criteria are important
   in a given situation. This also shows that while the Typhoon does not
    typically dominate in any one area it does compare well when looking
   at swing role operations, i.e. combinations of both air to air and air
     to ground operations. This is particularly true when cost is also
                                considered.

                      <h> Basic Data

     <p>The following tables detail some basic performance data. It should
       however be remembered that all of these figures are drawn from
        anticipated/expected performances as required by contractual
      obligations. At this time much of this data has been verified or
      indeed surpassed. The range data in particular though should be
                 considered approximate rather than final.
