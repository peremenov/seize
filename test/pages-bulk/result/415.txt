   <p>Sometimes citizens may need assistance disposing of a large quantity
   of limbs and other brush that cannot be accommodated through the
   Call-In Limb Pickup Program. For those occasions, the City of
   Fairfield also offers its Operation Dump Truck program in an effort to
   meet those needs.

   <p>Operation Dump Truck Under this program, the city will deliver to a
   city residence a roll-off dump box (or in some cases an actual dump
   truck) into which the resident may load limbs and other brush for
   disposal by the city. This service is offered on a first-come,
   first-served basis. In order to offer this service, the city asks
   residents to observe the following guidelines:

     <p>Schedule a date. Sign up for the service is available at the city's
   Public Works Department facility located at 8870 North Gilmore Road on
   a first come first served basis. Normal office hours are 8 a.m. to 5
   p.m. Monday through Friday. Residents will be required to sign a
   release form when the debris box is reserved. Available dates are
   generally scheduled far in advance -- so be sure to plan ahead. For
   information, call 513-867-4200. Dump boxes will not be delivered,
   picked up or dumped on Saturdays, Sundays or scheduled holidays. The
   use of a dump box is limited to two consecutive days, and up to two
   occasions per year, per household. The city will only dump debris
   boxes once per day.

     <p>Be prepared. A dump box will be delivered on the scheduled date
   between the hours of 7:00 and 8:00 A.M., and pick up will be on the
   scheduled date between the hours of 1:00 and 2:30 P.M. The dump box
   will be placed on your driveway for you to load. It is best to cut
   limbs to no more than four feet in length so that they will fit in the
   box. Overhanging loads are not permitted. The dimensions of the box
   are: 8-feet wide, 10-feet long and 42-inches deep.

     <p>Include only biodegradable plant materials. No building materials,
   plastic bags or trash will be accepted. Grass clippings are also
   prohibited. The resident will be charged if a load is contaminated
   with trash or other unacceptable materials. Charges will include, but
   are not limited to, any disposal fees for load separation, and/or
   labor time and equipment required by city personnel. Violation of
   these guidelines will result in the termination of the service and the
   resident will be responsible for removal and disposal of debris. A
   resident who combines items other than yard waste, will not be
   permitted to participate in the program in the future.

     <h>Service Limits
   <p>Both the Limb Pickup Program and Operation Dump Truck are intended to
   provide residents an option for normal trimmings and storm damage
   disposal. Residents contracting with professional tree trimming and
   removal services should include disposal in their contract since the
   city is unable to accommodate major disposal needs.
