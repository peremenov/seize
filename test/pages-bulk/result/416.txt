   <h>Evelyn Mary Mackintosh

   <p>Evelyn Mary Mackintosh began her service with the Women's Royal Naval
   Service in February 1918 and ended when she died in December of the
   same year.

   <p>Evelyn was born 22nd October 1895 to Duncan H. and Louisa M.
   Mackintosh in Tientsin, North China where her father worked for the
   Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank. She was described as "a very healthy
   jolly looking girl of the Officer type" who was "very keen to go to
   the East" by Edith A May, Divisional Director for Scotland, W.R.N.S.

   <p>At the time she was appointed to the WRNS she was living in Inverness
   and her first appointment was as "Assistant Principal for
   non-administrative duties" at the Naval Transport Office at Inverness.
   Her salary was £150 a year and in addition she received a £20 uniform
   grant and a hat badge, which she collected from Madam Elsmere, 146
   Brompton Road, London.

      <h>Detail from Evelyn Mackintosh's performance report dated June 30th
   1918. 
   <p>In November 1918 she volunteered for service at Bizerta, a
   strategically important seaport in Tunisia, as a decoder and was
   highly recommended by her commanding officer, Captain H.J. Rowley. She
   was turned down as she "had no decoding training". This inspite of a
   report written by Edith A May describing the nature of her work in
   Captain Rowley's office as being "decoding and confidential transport
   work".
