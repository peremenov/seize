<h>Power supply circuits -- INCOMPLETE

   <p>There are three major kinds of power supplies: unregulated (also
   called brute force), linear regulated, and switching. A fourth type of
   power supply circuit called the ripple-regulated, is a hybrid between
   the "brute force" and "switching" designs, and merits a subsection to
   itself.

  <h>Unregulated

   <p>An unregulated power supply is the most rudimentary type, consisting
   of a transformer, rectifier, and low-pass filter. These power supplies
   typically exhibit a lot of ripple voltage (i.e. rapidly-varying
   instability) and other AC "noise" superimposed on the DC power. If the
   input voltage varies, the output voltage will vary by a proportional
   amount. The advantage of an unregulated supply is that it's cheap,
   simple, and efficient.

  <h>Linear regulated

   <p>A linear regulated supply is simply a "brute force" (unregulated)
   power supply followed by a transistor circuit operating in its
   "active," or "linear" mode, hence the name linear regulator. (Obvious
   in retrospect, isn't it?) A typical linear regulator is designed to
   output a fixed voltage for a wide range of input voltages, and it
   simply drops any excess input voltage to allow a maximum output
   voltage to the load. This excess voltage drop results in significant
   power dissipation in the form of heat. If the input voltage gets too
   low, the transistor circuit will lose regulation, meaning that it will
   fail to keep the voltage steady. It can only drop excess voltage, not
   make up for a deficiency in voltage from the brute force section of
   the circuit. Therefore, you have to keep the input voltage at least 1
   to 3 volts higher than the desired output, depending on the regulator
   type. This means the power equivalent of at least 1 to 3 volts
   multiplied by the full load current will be dissipated by the
   regulator circuit, generating a lot of heat. This makes linear
   regulated power supplies rather inefficient. Also, to get rid of all
   that heat they have to use large heat sinks which makes them large,
   heavy, and expensive.

  <h>Switching

   <p>A switching regulated power supply ("switcher") is an effort to
   realize the advantages of both brute force and linear regulated
   designs (small, efficient, and cheap, but also "clean," stable output
   voltage). Switching power supplies work on the principle of rectifying
   the incoming AC power line voltage into DC, re-converting it into
   high-frequency square-wave AC through transistors operated as on/off
   switches, stepping that AC voltage up or down by using a lightweight
   transformer, then rectifying the transformer's AC output into DC and
   filtering for final output. Voltage regulation is achieved by altering
   the "duty cycle" of the DC-to-AC inversion on the transformer's
   primary side. In addition to lighter weight because of a smaller
   transformer core, switchers have another tremendous advantage over the
   prior two designs: this type of power supply can be made so totally
   independent of the input voltage that it can work on any electric
   power system in the world; these are called "universal" power
   supplies.

   <p>The downside of switchers is that they are more complex, and due to
   their operation they tend to generate a lot of high-frequency AC
   "noise" on the power line. Most switchers also have significant ripple
   voltage on their outputs. With the cheaper types, this noise and
   ripple can be as bad as for an unregulated power supply; such low-end
   switchers aren't worthless, because they still provide a stable
   average output voltage, and there's the "universal" input capability.

   <p>Expensive switchers are ripple-free and have noise nearly as low as
   for some a linear types; these switchers tend to be as expensive as
   linear supplies. The reason to use an expensive switcher instead of a
   good linear is if you need universal power system compatibility or
   high efficiency. High efficiency, light weight, and small size are the
   reasons switching power supplies are almost univerally used for
   powering digital computer circuitry.

  <h>Ripple regulated

   <p>A ripple-regulated power supply is an alternative to the linear
   regulated design scheme: a "brute force" power supply (transformer,
   rectifier, filter) constitutes the "front end" of the circuit, but a
   transistor operated strictly in its on/off (saturation/cutoff) modes
   transfers DC power to a large capacitor as needed to maintain the
   output voltage between a high and a low setpoint. As in switchers, the
   transistor in a ripple regulator never passes current while in its
   "active," or "linear," mode for any substantial length of time,
   meaning that very little energy will be wasted in the form of heat.
   However, the biggest drawback to this regulation scheme is the
   necessary presence of some ripple voltage on the output, as the DC
   voltage varies between the two voltage control setpoints. Also, this
   ripple voltage varies in frequency depending on load current, which
   makes final filtering of the DC power more difficult.

   <p>Ripple regulator circuits tend to be quite a bit simpler than switcher
   circuitry, and they need not handle the high power line voltages that
   switcher transistors must handle, making them safer to work on.

<h>Computational circuits

   <p>When someone mentions the word "computer," a digital device is what
   usually comes to mind. Digital circuits represent numerical quantities
   in binary format: patterns of 1's and 0's represented by a multitude
   of transistor circuits operating in saturated or cutoff states.
   However, analog circuitry may also be used to represent numerical
   quantities and perform mathematical calculations, by using variable
   voltage signals instead of discrete on/off states.

   <p>Here is a simple example of binary (digital) representation versus
   analog representation of the number "twenty-five:"

  
   <p>Digital circuits are very different from circuits built on analog
   principles. Digital computational circuits can be incredibly complex,
   and calculations must often be performed in sequential "steps" to
   obtain a final answer, much as a human being would perform
   arithmetical calculations in steps with pencil and paper. Analog
   computational circuits, on the other hand, are quite simple in
   comparison, and perform their calculations in continuous, real-time
   fashion. There is a disadvantage to using analog circuitry to
   represent numbers, though: imprecision. The digital circuit shown
   above is representing the number twenty-five, precisely. The analog
   circuit shown above may or may not be exactly calibrated to 25.000
   volts, but is subject to "drift" and error.

   <p>In applications where precision is not critical, analog computational
   circuits are very practical and elegant. Shown here are a few op-amp
   circuits for performing analog computation:

      <p>Each of these circuits may be used in modular fashion to create a
   circuit capable of multiple calculations. For instance, suppose that
   we needed to subtract a certain fraction of one variable from another
   variable. By combining a divide-by-constant circuit with a subtractor
   circuit, we could obtain the required function:

   
   <p>Devices called analog computers used to be common in universities and
   engineering shops, where dozens of op-amp circuits could be "patched"
   together with removable jumper wires to model mathematical statements,
   usually for the purpose of simulating some physical process whose
   underlying equations were known. Digital computers have made analog
   computers all but obsolete, but analog computational circuitry cannot
   be beaten by digital in terms of sheer elegance and economy of
   necessary components.

   <p>Analog computational circuitry excels at performing the calculus
   operations integration and differentiation with respect to time, by
   using capacitors in an op-amp feedback loop. To fully understand these
   circuits' operation and applications, though, we must first grasp the
   meaning of these fundamental calculus concepts. Fortunately, the
   application of op-amp circuits to real-world problems involving
   calculus serves as an excellent means to teach basic calculus. In the
   words of John I. Smith, taken from his outstanding textbook, Modern
   Operational Circuit Design:

     <p>"A note of encouragement is offered to certain readers: integral
     calculus is one of the mathematical disciplines that operational
     [amplifier] circuitry exploits and, in the process, rather
     demolishes as a barrier to understanding." (pg. 4)

   <p>Mr. Smith's sentiments on the pedagogical value of analog circuitry as
   a learning tool for mathematics are not unique. Consider the opinion
   of engineer George Fox Lang, in an article he wrote for the August
   2000 issue of the journal Sound and Vibration, entitled, "Analog was
   not a Computer Trademark!":

     <p>"Creating a real physical entity (a circuit) governed by a
     particular set of equations and interacting with it provides unique
     insight into those mathematical statements. There is no better way
     to develop a "gut feel" for the interplay between physics and
     mathematics than to experience such an interaction. The analog
     computer was a powerful interdisciplinary teaching tool; its
     obsolescence is mourned by many educators in a variety of fields."
     (pg. 23)

   <p>Differentiation is the first operation typically learned by beginning
   calculus students. Simply put, differentiation is determining the
   rate-of-change of one variable as it relates to another. In analog
   differentiator circuits, the independent variable is time, and so the
   rates of change we're dealing with are rates of change of some
   measured quantity over time.

   <p>Suppose we were to measure the position of a car, traveling in a
   direct path (no turns), from its starting point. Let us call this
   measurement, x. If the car moves at a rate such that its distance from
   "start" increases steadily over time, its position will plot on a
   graph as a linear function (straight line):

   
   <p>If we were to calculate the derivative of the car's position with
   respect to time (that is, determine the rate-of-change of the car's
   position over time), we would arrive at a quantity representing the
   car's velocity. The differentiation function is represented by the
   fractional notation d/d, so when differentiating position (x) with
   respect to time (t), we denote the result (the derivative) as dx/dt:

   
   <p>For a linear graph of x over time, the derivate of position (dx/dt),
   otherwise and more commonly known as velocity, will be a flat line,
   unchanging in value. The derivative of a mathematical function may be
   graphically understood as its slope when plotted on a graph, and here
   we can see that the position (x) graph has a constant slope, which
   means that its derivative (dx/dt) must be constant over time.

   <p>Now, suppose the distance traveled by the car increased exponentially
   over time: that is, it began its travel in slow movements, but covered
   more additional distance with each passing period in time. We would
   then see that the derivative of position (dx/dt), or velocity, would
   not be constant over time, but would increase:

   
   <p>The height of points on the velocity graph correspond to the
   rates-of-change, or slope, of points at corresponding times on the
   position graph:

   
   <p>What does this have to do with analog electronic circuits? Well, if we
   were to have an analog voltage signal represent the car's position
   (think of a huge potentiometer whose wiper was attached to the car,
   generating a voltage proportional to the car's position), we could
   connect a differentiator circuit to this signal and have the circuit
   continuously calculate the car's velocity, displaying the result via a
   voltmeter connected to the differentiator circuit's output:

   <p>Recall from the last chapter that a differentiator circuit outputs a
   voltage proportional to the input voltage's rate-of-change over time.
   Thus, if the input voltage is changing over time at a constant rate,
   the output voltage will be at a constant value. If the car moves in
   such a way that its elapsed distance over time builds up at a steady
   rate, then that means the car is traveling at a constant velocity, and
   the differentiator circuit will output a constant voltage proportional
   to that velocity. If the car's elapsed distance over time changes in a
   non-steady manner, the differentiator circuit's output will likewise
   be non-steady, but always at a level representative of the input's
   rate-of-change over time.

   <p>Note that the voltmeter registering velocity (at the output of the
   differentiator circuit) is connected in "reverse" polarity to the
   output of the op-amp. This is because the differentiator circuit shown
   is inverting: outputting a negative voltage for a positive input
   voltage rate-of-change. If we wish to have the voltmeter register a
   positive value for velocity, it will have to be connected to the
   op-amp as shown. As impractical as it may be to connect a giant
   potentiometer to a moving object such as an automobile, the concept
   should be clear: by electronically performing the calculus function of
   differentiation on a signal representing position, we obtain a signal
   representing velocity.

   <p>Beginning calculus students learn symbolic techniques for
   differentiation. However, this requires that the equation describing
   the original graph be known. For example, calculus students learn how
   to take a function such as y = 3x and find its derivative, 3, simply
   by manipulating the equation. We may verify the accuracy of this
   manipulation by comparing the graphs of the two functions:

   
   <p>Nonlinear functions such as y = 3x^2 may also be differentiated by
   symbolic means. In this case, the derivative of y = 3x^2 is 6x:

   
   <p>In real life, though, we often cannot describe the behavior of any
   physical event by a simple equation like y = 3x, and so symbolic
   differentiation of the type learned by calculus students may be
   impossible to apply to a physical measurement. If someone wished to
   determine the derivative of our hypothetical car's position (dx/dt =
   velocity) by symbolic means, they would first have to obtain an
   equation describing the car's position over time, based on position
   measurements taken from a real experiment -- a nearly impossible task
   unless the car is operated under carefully controlled conditions
   leading to a very simple position graph. However, an analog
   differentiator circuit, by exploiting the behavior of a capacitor with
   respect to voltage, current, and time i = C(dv/dt), naturally
   differentiates any real signal in relation to time, and would be able
   to output a signal corresponding to instantaneous velocity (dx/dt) at
   any moment. By logging the car's position signal along with the
   differentiator's output signal using a chart recorder or other data
   acquisition device, both graphs would naturally present themselves for
   inspection and analysis.

   <p>We may take the principle of differentiation one step further by
   applying it to the velocity signal using another differentiator
   circuit. In other words, use it to calculate the rate-of-change of
   velocity, which we know is the rate-of-change of position. What
   practical measure would we arrive at if we did this? Think of this in
   terms of the units we use to measure position and velocity. If we were
   to measure the car's position from its starting point in miles, then
   we would probably express its velocity in units of miles per hour
   (dx/dt). If we were to differentiate the velocity (measured in miles
   per hour), we would end up with a unit of miles per hour per hour.
   Elementary physics classes teach students about the behavior of
   falling objects, measuring position in meters, velocity in meters per
   second, and change in velocity over time in meters per second, per
   second. This final measure is called acceleration: the rate of change
   of velocity over time:

   
   <p>The expression d^2x/dt^2 is called the second derivative of position
   (x) with regard to time (t). If we were to connect a second
   differentiator circuit to the output of the first, the last voltmeter
   would register acceleration:

   
   <p>Deriving velocity from position, and acceleration from velocity, we
   see the principle of differentiation very clearly illustrated. These
   are not the only physical measurements related to each other in this
   way, but they are, perhaps, the most common. Another example of
   calculus in action is the relationship between liquid volume and
   liquid flow:

  
   <p>A "Level Transmitter" device mounted on a water storage tank provides
   a signal directly proportional to water level in the tank, which -- if
   the tank is of constant cross-sectional area throughout its height --
   directly equates water volume stored. If we were to take this volume
   signal and differentiate it with respect to time (dv/dt), we would
   obtain a signal proportional to the water flow rate through the pipe
   carrying water to the tank. A differentiator circuit connected in such
   a way as to receive this volume signal would produce an output signal
   proportional to flow, possibly substituting for a flow-measurement
   device ("Flow Transmitter") installed in the pipe.

   <p>Returning to the car experiment, suppose that our hypothetical car
   were equipped with a tachogenerator on one of the wheels, producing a
   voltage signal directly proportional to velocity. We could
   differentiate the signal to obtain acceleration with one circuit, like
   this:

   
   <p>In a sense, the tachogenerator by its very nature differentiates the
   car's position, generating a voltage proportional to how rapidly the
   wheel's angular position changes over time. This provides us with a
   raw signal already representative of velocity, with only a single step
   of differentiation needed to obtain an acceleration signal. A
   tachogenerator measuring velocity, of course, is a far more practical
   example of automobile instrumentation than a giant potentiometer
   measuring its physical position, but what we gain in practicality we
   lose in position measurement. No matter how many times we
   differentiate, we can never infer the car's position from a velocity
   signal. If the process of differentiation brought us from position to
   velocity to acceleration, then somehow we need to perform the
   "reverse" process of differentiation to go from velocity to position.
   Such a mathematical process does exist, and it is called integration.
   The "integrator" circuit may be used to perform this function:

   
   <p>Recall from the last chapter that an integrator circuit outputs a
   voltage whose rate-of-change over time is proportional to the input
   voltage's magnitude. Thus, given a constant input voltage, the output
   voltage will change at a constant rate. If the car travels at a
   constant velocity (constant voltage input to the integrator circuit
   from the tachogenerator), then its distance traveled will increase
   steadily as time progresses, and the integrator will output a steadily
   changing voltage proportional to that distance. If the car's velocity
   is not constant, then neither will the rate-of-change over time be of
   the integrator circuit's output, but the output voltage will
   faithfully represent the amount of distance traveled by the car at any
   given point in time.

   <p>The symbol for integration looks something like a very narrow, cursive
   letter "S". The equation utilizing this symbol tells us that we are
   integrating velocity (v) with respect to time (dt), and obtaining
   position (x) as a result of it.

   <p>So, we may express three measures of the car's motion (position,
   velocity, and acceleration) in terms of velocity (v) just as easily as
   we could in terms of position (x):

   
   <p>If we had an accelerometer attached to the car, generating a signal
   proportional to the rate of acceleration or deceleration, we could
   (hypothetically) obtain a velocity signal with one step of
   integration, and a position signal with a second step of integration:

   
   <p>Thus, all three measures of the car's motion (position, velocity, and
   acceleration) may be expressed in terms of acceleration:

   
   <p>As you might have suspected, the process of integration may be
   illustrated in, and applied to, other physical systems as well. Take
   for example the water storage tank and flow example shown earlier. If
   flow rate is the derivative of tank volume with respect to time (f =
   dv/dt), then we could also say that volume is the integral of flow
   rate:

   
   <p>If we were to use a "Flow Transmitter" device to measure water flow,
   then by integration we could calculate the volume of water accumulated
   in the tank over time. Although it is theoretically possible to use a
   capacitive op-amp integrator circuit to derive a volume signal from a
   flow signal, mechanical and digital electronic "integrator" devices
   are more practical for reasons of error and drift, and find frequent
   use in the water treatment and distribution industries.

   <p>Just as there are symbolic techniques for differentiation, there are
   also symbolic techniques for integration, although they tend to be
   more complex and varied. Applying symbolic integration to a real-world
   problem like the acceleration of a car, though, is still contingent on
   the availability of an equation precisely describing the measured
   signal -- often a difficult or impossible thing to derive from
   measured data. However, electronic integrator circuits perform this
   mathematical function continuously, in real time, and for any input
   signal profile, providing a powerful tool for scientists and
   engineers.

   <p>Having said this, there are caveats to the using calculus techniques
   to derive one type of measurement from another. Differentiation has
   the undesirable tendency of amplifying "noise" found in the measured
   variable, since the noise will typically appear as frequencies much
   higher than the measured variable, and high frequencies by their very
   nature possess high rates-of-change over time.

   <p>To illustrate this problem, suppose we were deriving a measurement of
   car acceleration from the velocity signal obtained from a
   tachogenerator with worn brushes or commutator bars. Points of poor
   contact between brush and commutator will produce momentary "dips" in
   the tachogenerator's output voltage, and the differentiator circuit
   connected to it will interpret these dips as very rapid changes in
   velocity. For a car moving at constant speed -- neither accelerating
   nor decelerating -- the acceleration signal should be 0 volts, but
   "noise" in the velocity signal caused by a faulty tachogenerator will
   cause the differentiated (acceleration) signal to contain "spikes,"
   falsely indicating brief periods of high acceleration and
   deceleration:


   <p>Noise voltage present in a signal to be differentiated need not be of
   significant amplitude to cause trouble: all that is required is that
   the noise profile have fast rise or fall times. In other words, any
   electrical noise with a high dv/dt component will be problematic when
   differentiated, even if it is of low amplitude.

   <p>It should be noted that this problem is not an artifact (an
   idiosyncratic error of the measuring/computing instrument) of the
   analog circuitry; rather, it is inherent to the process of
   differentiation. No matter how we might perform the differentiation,
   "noise" in the velocity signal will invariably corrupt the output
   signal. Of course, if we were differentiating a signal twice, as we
   did to obtain both velocity and acceleration from a position signal,
   the amplified noise signal output by the first differentiator circuit
   will be amplified again by the next differentiator, thus compounding
   the problem:


   <p>Integration, on the other hand, does not suffer from this problem,
   because high-frequency noise tends to be filtered out. One might
   suppose, then, that we could avoid all trouble by measuring
   acceleration directly and integrating that signal to obtain velocity;
   in effect, calculating in "reverse" from the way shown previously:

   
   <p>Unfortunately, following this methodology might lead us into other
   difficulties, the greatest being a common artifact of analog
   integrator circuits known as drift. All op-amps have some amount of
   input bias current, and this current will tend to cause a charge to
   accumulate on the capacitor in addition to whatever charge accumulates
   as a result of the input voltage signal. In other words, all analog
   integrator circuits suffer from the tendency of having their output
   voltage "drift" or "creep" even when there is absolutely no voltage
   input, accumulating error over time as a result. Also, imperfect
   capacitors will tend to lose their stored charge over time due to
   internal resistance, resulting in "drift" toward zero output voltage.
   These problems are artifacts of the analog circuitry, and may be
   eliminated through the use of digital computation.

   <p>Circuit artifacts notwithstanding, possible errors may result from the
   integration of one measurement (such as acceleration) to obtain
   another (such as velocity) simply because of the way integration
   works. If the "zero" calibration point of the raw signal sensor is not
   perfect, it will output a slight positive or negative signal even in
   conditions when it should output nothing. Consider a car with an
   imperfectly calibrated accelerometer, or one that is influenced by
   gravity to detect a slight acceleration unrelated to car motion. Even
   with a perfect integrating computer, this sensor error will cause the
   integrator to accumulate error, resulting in an output signal
   indicating a change of velocity when the car is neither accelerating
   nor decelerating.

   
   <p>As with differentiation, this error will also compound itself if the
   integrated signal is passed on to another integrator circuit, since
   the "drifting" output of the first integrator will very soon present a
   significant positive or negative signal for the next integrator to
   integrate. Therefore, care should be taken when integrating sensor
   signals: if the "zero" adjustment of the sensor is not perfect, the
   integrated result will drift, even if the integrator circuit itself is
   perfect. Again, it should be clearly understood that integrator errors
   such as these are fundamentally errors with the integrator and/or
   sensor devices themselves, and not inherent to the principle of signal
   integration. By contrast, differentiator errors (amplification of
   high-frequency noise) are inherent to the process of differentiation
   and are impossible to eliminate without completely eliminating input
   signal noise.
