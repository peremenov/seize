    <h>Tactical Aviation Issues in Review of the FY 97 Defense Budget
    March 15, 1996 - Senate Armed Services AirLand Forces Subcommittee

     <l>* Lt. General Harold Blot, Deputy Chief for Aviation, U.S. Marine
       Corps
     <l>* Maj. General David Mccloud, U.S. Air Force
     <l>* Admiral Dennis Mcginn, Director, Air Warfare Division,Office of
       Chief of Naval Operations
     <l>* Craig Steidle, Director, Naval Advanced Strike Technology Program
     <l>* Brig. General Robert Magnus, Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff,
       Aviation
     <l>* Lt. General Ed Eberhart, USAF Deputy Chief of Staff For Plans and
       Operations,

   <p>WARNER: The Committee will now come to order. We have before us a very
   distinguishedarray of aviators this morning. And our subcommittee, as
   the first hearing, leads off with someof the tough challenges. And we
   welcome you.

   <p>I'm going to put brief remarks in the record, but just sitting here
   thinking back over a lifetimeof my own if I had to figure out, Senator
   Levin, one or two disappointments in my lifetime -- thefirst was not
   achieving Navy gold wings. But unfortunately World War II had ended,
   and theydidn't need a lot of youngsters in the pipeline anymore and we
   all went home.

   <p>But, ever since then I've been highly envious of those of you who
   sought as your professions-- aviation. It's a very challenging,
   high-risk occupation. I realize, and I think most realize,every day
   you get in that cockpit there's a certain measure of personal risk. I
   want to thank each of you and tens of thousands like you, where ever
   they are today, forhaving made this contribution to our nation's
   security.

   <p>The work of this Committee, however, is to try and evaluate the
   various programs broughtforth by the commander-in-chief, the
   President, to the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretariesof the Air
   Force and Navy. And therein again, I've had the privilege of having a
   good deal ofexperience through the years.
   <p>And it's particularly sad for me to address this morning the F-14
   program -- a program thatwas brought in while I served in the
   Department of the Navy, and have spent a good many hoursin the rear
   seat of that aircraft in the early days. But it's a fine airplane. It
   has served the countrywell. And I hope that we can put fixes in to
   allow it to continue to have service to the nation forsuch service
   life technically as we can get out of it.

   <p>The JAST program -- I was sort of sitting here scratching a note or
   two -- the challenges hereare almost like going to the moon. And this
   time it's TAC Air. There's a high technical risk. There's a high
   financial risk. And there's a high political risk. All three of them
   are wrappedup in this program.

   <p>And we're very anxious to hear from you this morning on that, General,
   so I won't takefurther time. We're anxious to hear from the witnesses,
   but I'd like to hear from mydistinguished colleague.

   <p>LEVIN: We've been together now, we came together some 18 years ago to
   the United StatesSenate and we've worked side by side. We've traveled
   the world together with prettychallenging assignments. And who knows,
   with a little luck, we might be sitting here for awhile longer.

   <p>WARNER: Well, I'm privileged to have you...

   <p>LEVIN: Well, I agree with that too...

   <p>WARNER: ...the ranking member of our subcommittee.

   <p>LEVIN: And I just want to thank you, Senator Warner. It has been
   indeed a privilege towork with you for these many years, and whether
   I'm Chairing a subcommittee and you'reranking member, or you're
   Chairing and I'm ranking member, we're working on so many otherthings,
   we've always worked together in a spirit of cooperation.

   <p>Some of these people ask me about the U.S. Senate -- it must be
   difficult to work in the U.S.Senate these days. And I always say, No,
   you must be thinking of the House of Representatives,because we really
   work together very well as team in the Senate.

   <p>And we've alternated whose been the majority over this decade-
   and-a-half and regardless ofwho's in the majority and who's in the
   minority it's worked out very well. And ours staff haveworked together
   consistently, so that's going to be the order of the day again. And
   it'snecessary, because of the challenges we face -- not as challenging
   as what you folks have facedin the cockpits over the years, but
   nonetheless, a different kind of challenge,

   <p>And the Chairman's mentioned a number of them, including a JAST
   program and some ofour other acquisitions. You know, why for instance,
   are we buying more F-15s and F-16s at thistime?

   <p>That's a question that's very much on my mind as to whether that makes
   sense for us to dothat. But I agree with the chairman. I think the
   JAST program is one that we're going to have topay a lot of attention
   to because of the number of challenges that it presents.

   <p>I'm interested in the digitization issue as to why we're not making as
   much progress with oursituational awareness in the air as the Army has
   done with its digitization program on theground, which has given it
   tremendous situation awareness. That's something that thissubcommittee
   has been pressing for many years, as well.

   <p>So, Mr. Chairman, I also will put some remarks in the record which are
   in more detail. But Ijust want to join you in welcoming our witnesses
   and thanking them for their presence, for their contribution over the
   years, and again, saying how much I look forward to working with you
   thisyear again.

   <p>WARNER: Fine. All right, General. Turn up the engine.

   <p>MCGINN: Didn't preflight this very well. Can you hear me, sir?

   <p>WARNER: Yeah, we can hear you great.

   <p>MCGINN: Well, it's an honor to be with you this morning and talk about
   issues of such...

   <p>WARNER: But you will need to draw that up somewhat...

   <p>MCGINN: OK.

   <p>WARNED: ...somewhat more closely.

   <p>MCGINN: It's an honor to be with you this morning and talk about
   issues that are soimportant to our great nation, because in my view
   they're key to joint warfighting, today and toour success in the
   future. And that's air power.

   <p>With your approval, what I'd like to do is submit my opening remarks
   for the record ...

   <p>WARNER: No objection. No objection.

   <p>MCGINN: ... and in those remarks, as well as in the other prepared
   statements that we'vesubmitted to the Committee, we addressed those
   questions you asked in your letter of invitationto appear before the
   Committee.

   <p>WARNER: Thank you.

   <p>EBERHART: Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, it is a privilege
   and a pleasurefor me to appear before you to present an overview of
   Naval Aviation's present tacticalcapabilities, and our vision for the
   future. I would also to abbreviate my time here and openingremarks and
   submit them for them the record.

   <p>WARNER: No objection.

   <p>EBERHART: I would like to, Senator Warner, make an offer, if you can
   find the time I'lltalk to Admiral T. Ball Hayden, the chief of our
   Naval Air Training, and see if we can get you aslot down there in
   Pensacola to come down.

   <p>WARNER: I hate to tell you. I started in the Yellow Peril, which was
   the old biplane withcanvas and whatever was in it -- I don't know. I
   do know those days are gone. Thank you verymuch.

   <p>EBERHART: Yes, sir.

   <p>And I'd like to also recount just briefly that I had a phone
   conversation this morning withAdmiral Hank Giffen, the commander of
   the George Washington battle group. He's preparingthat aircraft
   carrier and his battle group to transit the Suez Canal later on today.
   They're en routeto the Persian Gulf to work for the CINC Central
   Command.

   <p>Admiral Lyle Bien and his battle group on the Nimitz is steaming
   across the Indian Ocean enroute to the vicinity of Taiwan, where they
   will join Admiral Jim Ellis and the Independence battle group in
   providing that tremendously capable presence to hopefully stabilize
   that area.

   <p>With that, sir, I look forward to answering any questions that you and
   the subcommitteemembers may have.

   <p>WARNER: Admiral.

   <p>STEIDLE: Sir. Good morning, sir. I'm Craig Steidle. I'm the program
   director for theJAST program.

   <p>Sir, I thank you very much for your invitation to be here to discuss
   the Joint Advance StrikeTechnology program, a program that has just
   transitioned to the Joint Strike Fighter program. Because it has been
   so dynamic, I have a short brief statement. I also have a more
   detailedlonger version I'll submit, sir.

   <p>WARNER: Well, all statements in their entirety will be admitted to the
   record, and you mayproceed with your short statement.

   <p>STEIDLE: Yes, sir. Thank you.

   <p>Sir, we have matured from the JAST program and are now converging on
   an affordablesolution that meets requirements of all three services,
   plus our allies -- the Navy, Marine Corpsand the Air Force as well as
   our allies. Specific focus on the program remains affordability
   --reducing the development costs, production costs, costs of ownership
   of Joint Strike Fighterfamily of airplanes.

   <p>We've fully merged the advanced research and project agencies, ASTOVL,
   Advanced ShortTake-Off and Vertical Landing program, into the Joint
   Strike Fighter program. And additionallythe United Kingdom Royal Navy
   has joined the program as a collaborative partner. They arecommitting
   $200 million to the program in accordance with the terms of an MOU
   that we signedin December of '95.

   <p>Interest has been extremely high in other foreign countries. We've
   provided several differentbriefings, and I expect the interest to
   continue at a high level.

   <p>The program focuses on a new approach for weapons systems acquisition.
   We applied therecommendations of the Packard commission and other
   experts in acquisition reform. Wecreated an environment that provides
   early interaction between the warfighters and the technologists in
   order to be able to make cost and performance trades early. And that's
   been asignificant part of the program.

   <p>We've done this by utilizing the integrated product development team
   process. Industry is afull partner in this process, and they welcome
   this tremendously. They have been very positivein our process and our
   way of doing business.

   <p>The first formal product that came out of this integrated
   industry-warfighter technologistsgroup and teaming relationship was
   our initial requirements document that was signed by allthree services
   last August, and was submitted, approved and endorsed by the JROC in
   Augustof last year.

   <p>We continue to be a role model for acquisition reform and streamlining
   a lot of initiatives incoherence with our industrial partner. We're
   just completing the concept definition phase.

   <p>We'll finish that phase this summer, and then move on into the concept
   development phasewhere we will downsize from three teams that we have
   today to two teams. Each one of theteams will build demonstrators
   demonstrating commonality, hovering transition, flying qualities, as
   well as continue with our research and development technology
   maturationprograms.

   <p>STEIDLE: Each one of the contractors will demonstrate two aircraft,
   and demonstrate theparticular attributes that I just mentioned. In
   conclusion, sir, we strongly...

   <p>WARNER: Let's just stop a minute. That's a total of -- what? -- six
   aircraft?

   <p>STEIDLE: No, sir. That'll be two aircraft. We'll downsize to two
   concept developmentteams, and each one of those teams will fly two
   airplanes each.

   <p>WARNER: So that's four?

   <p>STEIDLE: Yes, sir. Four airplanes, yes, sir.

   <p>So, in my concluding remarks, sir, the services stand extremely
   committed to the program asdoes OSD and industry. And I stand by to
   answer any of your questions, sir.

   <p>WARNER: One of the questions I will ask -- and I was going to send
   this up so you couldread it if you haven't. I'm sure you have read the
   New York Times article.

   <p>STEIDLE: Yes, sir. I have.

   <p>WARNER: And I'm going to ask you momentarily if you would sort of give
   us a side byside as to -- it appears to me to be very well written and
   researched. But since it's a significantpiece on this article -- and I
   commend the paper and the writer -- I want to make sure our
   recordshows any areas of which you as the manager disagree.

   <p>STEIDLE: Yes, sir.

   <p>WARNER: So you have it there.

   <p>STEIDLE: No, sir. I don't, but I do remember the article.

   <p>WARNER: Well, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll get it reproduced for
   you and sent right upthere.

   <p>STEIDLE: Thank you.

   <p>WARNER: General.

   <p>MAGNUS: Mr. Chairman, Senator, good morning. I thank you for the
   opportunity to appearbefore you to discuss Marine Corps tactical
   aviation.

   <p>I also have, in addition to the formal statement, I have some short
   opening remarks which Iwould prefer to submit for the record. And I
   would like to also add that on behalf of the strongsupport of the
   Congress and the people of the United States, the Marine Corps has
   always beenready to be -- whether it's forward deployed or on bases in
   the United States -- to continue to beAmerica's 911 force.

   <p>In addition to the forward deployed forces that Admiral McGinn has
   mentioned and, ofcourse, my Air Force wingmen has around the world,
   today you have Marines and F-18Ds andE-A6Bs poised in Aviano to
   support American and allied forces in Bosnia. There are Marine forces
   forward deployed in Okinawa and on the main islands of Japan ready to
   supportcontingencies there. And as our Commandant has said...

   <p>WARNER: I visited the Marines in Aviano on my last trip there.

   <p>MAGNUS: Yes, Sir.

   <p>And there are Marines embarked on amphibious ships across the globe
   supporting the carrierbattle forces with our Vietnam-era helicopters
   prepared to do the nation's bidding.

   <p>All I can say to echo our Commandant is readiness is our business. And
   we stand by toanswer your questions.

   <p>WARNER: All right, gentlemen. What I would like to do is to start with
   you, GeneralEberhart. And I presume you've had an opportunity to have
   reviewed to some extent the recordof this subcommittee as it reviewed
   the 22 program last year. And our major concern with thesubject of
   concurrency. Would you start, sort of as a threshold where we left off
   last year, howthe '96 program has unfolded to date, and what you would
   hope to do on concurrency issue inthe '97.

   <p>EBERHART: Sir, I have reviewed the concurrency issue. With your
   permission, I'd like togo back just a little bit further though and
   talk about -- we were concerned with concurrencyfrom the very
   beginning to make sure that we were going to get this correct. As
   such, we lookedat what the Packard Commission said about concurrency.

   <p>EBERHART: We think this program complies with the, what was pointed
   out in the PackardCommission. Rand looked at the concurrency issue.
   They commented favorably in terms ofconcurrency in the F-22. And just
   to make sure that we had it right, as you know, the DefenseScience
   Board looked at this issue and submitted a report in 1995, which in
   our view supportsthe fact that it's not too concurrent. There is some
   concurrency. We think there will beconcurrency in most all programs
   today. But we're comfortable with that concurrency. Wethink it's under
   control.

   <p>WARNER: We added to be 70-odd aircraft in operational status before
   the last milestone iscompleted under -- is it the T&E program?

   <p>EBERHART: Sir, before we go to full-rate production, there'll be
   70-some-odd airplanes. Asyou know, when we looked at the acquisition
   reform of '94, they recommended approximately10 percent, which, if had
   we stayed with the original buy of about 700 and some-odd, 10
   percentwould have been 70-some-odd. But as we've drawn down the total
   buy, and also extended theperiod of EMD, we think that's a natural
   consequence that we will in fact have more airplanes aswe go to
   full-rate production than this 10 percent guideline talks about.

   <p>But we think the important parts -- and they have been, once again,
   authenticated by thereports that we talked about -- is first of all,
   the DT&E, which we think is most important, willbe finished
   essentially by the time we have four airplanes.

   <p>WARNER: For the record, spell out, I know what DT&E...

   <p>EBERHART: Development Test and Evaluation.

   <p>WARNER: Right.
   <p>EBERHART: And then the initial operations test and evaluation, the
   Rand Corporation saidmost problems unfold between the 10 and 20
   percent point in IOT&E. And we will in fact have27 percent of IOT&E.
   For these reasons, sir, we believe that concurrency is just about
   right inthis program. We'll continue to watch it. We're concerned
   about it just as you are, but we thinkit's on the mark.

   <p>WARNER: Now, each of the us have different views. I think it's,
   really, one of the highestrates of concurrency that I've experienced.
   But that, in your judgment -- and General Fogelmanhas testified this
   week before this committee -- that degree of concurrency is driven by
   thethreat assessment that has been made by a variety of sources, by
   traditional sources, such that tohave U.S. air dominance in the
   theater, in the time frame when this plane is scheduled to come in, it
   simply has to have that number of aircraft, and that design of
   aircraft, to meet that threat. Is that a fair summary?

   <p>EBERHART: Sir, we're concerned about air dominance. We're concerned
   about insuringthat we have air dominance as quickly as possible. And
   in our view, the F-22 does that for us.But again, when you look at the
   number of airplanes, the 70-some- odd, by the time we go tofull rate,
   if we go back to some of the other factors we talked about in terms of
   an extendedEMD in having a bi-profile that makes sense.

  <p> WARNER: Well, but it's the threat scenario that's driving that quantum
   of concurrency. Andthat depends on individuals to how you want to
   quantify it. I mean, you very carefully havequantified it from a
   technical perspective.

   <p>WARNER: I just quantify it based on past experience. I mean this
   Committee has gonethrough a number of aircraft programs that have not
   materialized as originally envisioned. Let'stalk about your fly-away
   costs for 22. Considering the changes in the program to date --
   andthere has been a reassessment of weight -- General Fogleman went
   into that. Did you have anopportunity to be debriefed on what he said
   on weight?

   <p>EBERHART: Yes, Sir, I did.

   <p>WARNER: To capsule the weight issue, as I recall it, was that he
   decided he could make adegradation in the envelope, and thereby allow
   an increase in the weight. And that degradationin his professional
   judgement would not substantially in any way affect the performance of
   thisaircraft to meet the threats. Is that correct?

   <p>EBERHART: Yes, Sir. That's essentially correct. There's a little more
   to it, but that's...

   <p>WARNER: Well, why don't you put that in?

   <p>EBERHART: Yes, Sir. I think that when you look at the weight of the
   airplane, it's stillabout 2,500 pounds below what we think the max
   allowable weight would be for this airplane.We did look at -- and I
   think you know, and you referenced the testimony last year -- that in
   fact,at that time, we were concerned about the weight growth that we
   had seen to that time. Andwe've taken very aggressive measures to
   bring this under control. And we think we have todayto include
   weighing, to reviewing it every other week, to reporting it to the
   program manager.

   <p>We have actually had the opportunity now to weigh some of the parts.
   In fact, we'veweighed about ten percent of the parts -- the actual
   parts that we've cut -- and we're plus 30pounds out of this whole
   3,000 pounds that we've weighed. And then when we've look atavionics,
   we've weighed hundreds of pieces and we're minus ten pounds. So we
   think we havegood understanding that our model is on track.

   <p>The situation you're talking about is where we looked at the weight
   that we had at that time,and what it was going to take in terms of
   thrust to get us the G available at 1.0 on theperformance curve.

   <p>We looked at what that would cost us in terms of dollars to insure a
   very small change in Gavailable. I'm talking .0 something in terms of
   Gs. Very negligible. We looked at what thatmeant in terms of
   operational capability. And we believed that was negligible -- and it
   wasn'tjust the Air Force, Sir, we vetted this and vetted this through
   the JROC process with the othervice chiefs, the vice chairman and the
   chairman and the CINCs to make sure everyone understood what this
   meant -- negligible in terms of operational capability. I guess the
   bottomline is we looked at it based on what it would cost us to keep
   that .0X amount of Gs at this onepoint on the performance curve, and
   we didn't think the cost was worth it.

   <p>WARNER: Let's return momentarily and then I'll yield to my colleague.
   About the fly-awaycost, what do you estimate the fly-away cost of 22
   in the fiscal '96 dollars?

   <p>EBERHART: Sir, I'll -- I get the fly-away costs confused a little bit
   here, so let me makesure that I understand it. I think it's around $70
   million, but let me check that for you to makesure I have it right.

   <p>It's $71.2, Sir. For the record, $71.2.

   <p>WARNER: $71.2.

   <p>EBERHART: Yes, Sir.

   <p>WARNER: And that's predicated on 442 units?

   <p>EBERHART: Yes, Sir.

   <p>WARNER: Senator Levin.

   <p>LEVIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

   <p>LEVIN: On the F-22 concurrency issue first. Is there more or less
   concurrency with thereduced buy?

   <p>EBERHART: Sir, in terms of the reduced buy, coupled with stretching
   out EMD, there isless concurrency.

   <p>LEVIN: So that even though we're buying a greater percentage -- put it
   -- no -- even thoughthe full rate production of the F-22 is for a
   smaller percentage of the total buy, the concurrencyhas actually been
   reduced.

   <p>EBERHART: Sir, I believe that once you stretch out EMD, and you have
   longer to workthese issues and the IOC moves right -- the initial
   operation capability -- and you have moretime to work this test and
   evaluation phase, that that reduces the concurrency.

   <p>LEVIN: Now you, in answer to the Chairman's question as to whether or
   not the schedulefor the F-22 is threat driven, answered, as I
   understand it, that it is in fact not being driven by thethreat. But
   I'd like you to put that in your own words.

   <p>Are we producing this based on what is a proper, safe, rate of
   development, or are weproducing this quicker than that in order to
   meet some kind of a presumed threat that we'regoing to face in the out
   years?

   <p>EBERHART: Sir, I think that in every case, this is a balance between
   the threat that weanticipate and what we think is acceptable
   concurrency, and acceptable and affordable rate ofproduction. So I
   think we balance those two things, and that's how we decide what the
   IOC is.

   <p>LEVIN: Has the concurrency rate changed in the last two years for the
   F-22?

   <p>EBERHART: Sir, I have not addressed a question specifically like that,
   and I'm not anacquisition expert. I will provide for the record my
   view that we have stretched out EMD overthe last couple of years.
   We've moved the IOC right. So to me, as an operator, that means
   thatthe concurrency -- it's not as concurrent. Now I'll have to ask
   the acquisition experts if theyagree, if their definition of
   concurrency is the same as mine.

   <p>LEVIN: OK. So that from your operator's perspective, there's less
   concurrency now in thisprogram than there was two years ago?

   <p>EBERHART: That would be my view as an operator. Yes, Sir.

   <p>LEVIN: I think it would be useful to give us those charts showing us
   those timelinescomparing for us the milestones that exist now to what
   they looked like two years ago. I think itwould be helpful...

   <p>EBERHART: Yes, Sir.

   <p>LEVIN: ... to do that for the record. Now the Science Board found that
   for the F-22, thatengine development and passive avionics were the
   highest risk areas in terms of concurrency.

   <p>EBERHART: Yes, Sir.

   <p>LEVIN: Could you comment on that?

   <p>EBELHART: Yes, sir. And, in fact, I had the privilege of going down to
   Pratt & Whitney atWest Palm a couple of weeks ago and looking at the
   engine on the stand and receiving extensivebriefings on where they
   were a year ago -- and where they were two years ago and where
   theyare.

   <p>It's very impressive, the steps they have taken to make sure that this
   airplane and the enginewill be ready for a first flight in May of '97.
   And I'm convinced it will. But the types ofredesign we have done to
   include the advances with the Howell blade, we're convinced thatthat
   will in fact work. It has tested so well on the test band, on the test
   stand, and it's a go forMay of '97 for the maiden flight.

   <p>LEVIN: The science board report indicated that about 20 percent of the
   avionics testing wasgoing to be completed before the Lot 2 contract
   award. And as I understand, Lot 2 begins atwhat plane? Give me
   their...

   <p>EBERHART: Sir, I don't have that in front of me. We'll see if we can
   get it behind here, ifnot, we will submit that for the record.

   <p>LEVIN: OK. Well, my question doesn't depend on the answer to that. So
   whatever theplane number is where Lot 2 begins, it was our
   understanding from the science board report thatthe avionics testing
   would be 20 percent completed before that point. OK? Now, in terms
   ofthe engine testing, we did not have a specific number. Do you know
   what that number is? Inother words, what percentage of the engine
   testing was to be completed prior to Lot 2 production?

   <p>EBERHART: I do not know, sir. I'll have to submit that for the record.

   <p>LEVIN: OK. That'll be fine. Do you know how much of the testing, the
   engine testing, isgoing to be actual testing as compared to modeling
   and simulation? Is that something youwould know off- hand?

   <p>EBERHART: No, sir. I'm sorry. I'll submit that for the record.

   <p>LEVIN: No, there's no problem. That's fine. Just submit that for the
   record.

   <p>EBERHART: Yes, sir. Again, as an operator -- going down there,
   visiting at Pratt &Whitney, I was very impressed with what I saw.

   <p>LEVIN: There was a question, Admiral McGinn on concurrency on the F-18
   E&F and eventhough it is a concurrency question so let me use this
   moment to ask you about that. I think thatat yesterday's hearing,
   Senator Warner noted that there would 76 F-22s that would be
   authorizedand appropriated by Congress when the operational testing on
   the F-22 is completed. Believethat was the figure that was used.

   <p>Now the F-18 E&F program, it would appear that Congress will have
   authorized andappropriated funds for 114 E&Fs before operational
   testing is completed. Now is that not evena greater concurrency issue
   then on the E&Fs than it would be on the F-22s if those numbersare
   correct or approximately correct?

   <p>MCGINN: Senator Levin I'd like to turn to my colleague Craig Steidle
   who was a formerprogram manager for the F/A18-E/F and I think he can
   give you a more informed answer onthat.

   <p>STEIDLE: Sir, if you don't mind, I'll answer that. When we put that
   program together it wasa non-concurrent program with demonstrated
   performance at every milestone. Before we hadapproval to go on with
   the first LRIP buy, we had first flight. But before we were allowed
   togo for the second one, we had demonstrated 250 glides and flying of
   all seven test articles. Before we went on for the third LRIP we had
   another demonstrated performance. So it was avery non-concurrent
   program with demonstrated performance.

   <p>The operational testing of that particular aircraft started very early
   in the simulators withenough assessment, first of all, and there was a
   long string. The operational testing finisheswhen we have a full suite
   of aircraft -- full suite of weapons in the inventory, but the
   airplaneis fielded before that with a list of required weapons suites
   that the service has provided for us. So -- I'm sorry -- but it is
   demonstrated performance doing milestones which continues onthroughout
   the process.

   <p>LEVIN: Has there been any change in those milestones during the level
   of concurrency on Eand Fs?

   <p>STEIDLE: No, sir. There hasn't. We've been on schedule, on performance
   all the waythrough. It's worked well.

   <p>WARNER: Let me go back on the 22 concurrency, you're referring to the
   science boardreport of April, 1995, page 35. Do you have a copy of
   that with you, General.

   <p>EBERHART: I do now, sir.

   <p>WARNER: Just a rough calculation, the American taxpayers are going to
   have about a halfbillion dollars invested in airplanes flying during
   this current cycle. That's a lot of money. Ioccurs to me that we
   should have some assurance from Congress that if you in the course of
   thisprogram discover, Jerry our problems. And that's going to
   exacerbate the concurrency problem. What procedures do we have in
   place for first, addressing those problems internally and makingsuch
   adjustments to the program that may be required? And secondly,
   informing the Congresspromptly of what you intend to do?

   <p>EBERHART: Sir, in terms of specific procedures in place, I don't know.
   I'll have to submitthat for the record. I can tell you when the issues
   that you've talked about earlier that referencethat point on the
   performance curb where we are looking at what that would cost us to
   stay withit and also when we looked at a range issue, that in both
   cases, as soon as that was found out,that came forward to Air Force
   leadership, immediately went into the JROC process and we were over
   talking to members of your committee and yourself, sir, to discuss
   those with you.

   <p>EBERHART: I pledge to you that we've learned from other programs,
   other issues, that thisbad news doesn't get better with age; that we
   need to go ahead and address the issue. Andeverybody who has a stake
   in the action needs to know about it and be involved in thecorrective
   action. In terms of the specific process or procedures that are in
   place, I'll have to gocheck with the acquisition committee. But
   watching that first-hand at that time, I was the J onthe Joint Staff
   and I saw that unfold, which really gave me a good feeling about -- I
   think it'stied to the new acquisition reform process and those types
   of things.

   <p>WARNER: Just reading from page 35, quote, If there are significant
   delays in theaccomplishment of these key events and they're described
   earlier, or if the performance levelsachieved are unacceptable, the
   program could be adjusted by staying at the four aircraft per
   yearproduction rate for an additional year. And you giving the
   committee the assurance that they're inplace besieged us to make that
   prompt adjustment. Is that correct? And you will provide forthe
   record?

   <p>EBERHART: Sir, I believe they're in place. I will provide for the
   record what they are. Ifthey're not, I'll provide for the record that
   they're not in place and then what we need to do tosatisfy that
   requirement.

   <p>WARNER: And I would like just a sentence in the letter that this
   matter has been reviewedby the secretary of the Air Force. I just
   think it's very important that a matter of this seriousness,that the
   secretary give you full support which you're entitled to make that
   tough decision for thedepartment.

   <p>EBERHART: Sir, I agree, and I'm sure she will.

   <p>WARNER: It's very important representation to the committee. Let's
   proceed on to anotherissue.

   <p>LEVIN: There's one...

   <p>WARNER: Yes, sure.

   <p>LEVIN: On that one question -- just on this issue, it's a -- we're
   going to need to be satisfiedon this concurrency issue. I for -- is
   not particularly satisfied with the answer that you gave tothe
   chairman about whether or not this was not threat-driven or not. We
   are not going to takerisks, I hope, to in this program. that are going
   to be driven by a threat when it seems to me weshould make sure that
   we do not make mistakes in the building of this plane and I, for
   one,would rather it be done right in a year or two later than to find
   that we've got to do a bunch offixes on this plane. So when you were
   asked whether or not it was threat-driven and then whenyou told me and
   your answer to that was non-committal when the chairman asked you, and
   thenwhen I asked you the question about the level of risk and the
   concurrency and the same issuethat the chairman raised, you talked
   about a delicate balance between getting there as soon aspossible
   which was your words.

   <p>LEVIN: I'm a little concerned when you say as soon as possible. I
   think I would have saidit, I would have put a qualifier before
   possible, like as soon as reasonably possible or with reasonable
   degree of certainty, or something in there to give us some assurance
   on theconcurrency issue. But let me phrase the question this way, and
   you may not be able to answerthis, General. And if so, that's fine.
   You can do it for the record -- you don't have to worryabout that. But
   the science board's findings about the acceptable overlap in the F-22
   programbetween testing and production depends upon requiring that the
   development and the testing --excuse me -- must pass certain key
   events which are identified. And this was what theChairman was
   referring to.

   <p>In the C-17 program, which was also supposed to be operating on an
   event-based schedule,the production imperative kept us signing
   contracts even though the events were slipping. NowAdmiral Steidle, on
   the F-18 description, said that we must meet key events before
   releasingprocurement funds. It was a very clear answer on that
   question. And I think the Chairman'squestion may have been -- I may be
   duplicating the Chairman's question, but if I am let me putthis in my
   own words. Is the Air Force committed to sticking to achieving testing
   events as anecessary prerequisite to signing the F-22 contract?

   <p>EBERHART: Sir, we certainly are.

   <p>LEVIN: Pardon?

   <p>EBERHART: We certainly are, yes. We have to go through those wickets,
   we have toestablish those goals before DABs and pre-DAB and DRB
   decisions. So we will have thosemilestones before we can move from one
   portion of the program to another. And we'recommitted to that. I
   think...

   <p>LEVIN: And our contracts provide for that? Our existing contracts
   provide for that?

   <p>EBERHART: Sir, I assume...

   <p>LEVIN: Let us know, let us know that for the record.

   <p>EBERHART: Again, I'll have to provide that for the record.

   <p>LEVIN: We just don't -- we want to be moving here according to testing
   events having beenmet, not according to a schedule which is set forth
   in a contract with a contractor. That's thepoint here, and if you can
   give us that assurance for the record I think that at least helps me
   outsome. Thank you.

   <p>EBERHART: And back to your original question. I think your choice of
   words is probablymuch better than mine, but I think the bottom line is
   that we are comfortable with theconcurrency. We think that the risk is
   acceptable, that we're not letting the threat drive us to dosomething
   stupid, something dumb. We're comfortable with that balance. And we're
   not -- asyou said, as soon as reasonably possible is probably a better
   choice of words.

   <p>LEVIN: My memory goes back here not just to the C-17 but to the B-1
   and B-2... Yeah,where we -- you know, we had -- somehow or other there
   was a window of vulnerability, andwe had to rush the B-1. And we made
   a mistake, made a lot of mistakes. As a result, it didn't have the
   capabilities that we wanted it to have. Instead of saying, look, let's
   build the B-2 and doit right and take, if we have, quote, a little
   more vulnerability for a few more years, my God,we've got enough
   capability in that area anyway, let's do it right.

   <p>EBERHART: Yes, sir.

   <p>LEVIN: Instead we, I think -- and I don't want to rehash the whole B-1
   battle -- but I thinkthe chairman's point is, and I would agree, is
   that we really want to do the F-22 right, and we donot want a
   high-level of concurrency. And if that means we get it done a year or
   two years later,so be it.

   <p>EBERHART: Yes, sir. Sir, those lessons that you referenced are not
   lost on the Air Forceeither, and we're very concerned about those as
   we move forward.

   <p>EBERHART: And we're -- bottom line is we're comfortable with the
   concurrency we see inthis program.

   <p>LEVIN: Well, you know, everybody has his own view. In my view, it's a
   very high degreeof concurrency associated with a high degree of risk
   and I've always been under the impressionthat the threat that was
   driving this not in a stupid area, but just we were at the outer edge
   of theenvelope, as you say, you fly on the area of risk and
   concurrency. And that was driven by thesurface-to-air threat. And I
   seem to have gained that from General Fogleman's testimonybecause it's
   -- this program is very, very expensive. It's consuming ever larger
   amount of theoverall budget -- not only Department of the Air Force,
   of the across-the-board tac air program,and that likewise concerns me.

   <p>WARNER: Let's go to Admiral and the JAST -- have you had a chance to
   look at the Time'sarticle?

   <p>STEIDLE: Yes, sir.

   <p>WARNER: And are there areas in which you feel that you would like to
   put information,comments...

   <p>STEIDLE: Yes, sir, I would.

   <p>WARNER: ...otherwise in the record? Fine.

   <p>STEIDLE: Yes, sir, I would.

   <p>WARNER: Because it's an important piece, and I want to make sure that
   our record reflectsany thoughts you have.

   <p>STEIDLE: Yes, sir. I think Mr. Shannon did an outstanding job on the
   article in total, sir.

   <p>WARNER: Did he interview you, by any chance?

   <p>STEIDLE: Yes, sir, he did.

   <p>WARNER: Well, that's why it's outstanding then.

   <p>STEIDLE: Yes, sir. There was one area that he linked...

   <p>WARNER: Why don't you teach us politicians how you...

   <p>STEIDLE: Yes, sir. He had linked me to the $750 billion estimate that
   he had, and I, in fact,went back to him after the session that we had
   and said, I cannot add my numbers up to get to that particular figure.
   Mr. Blackwell from Lockheed mentioned a trillion dollar program and
   aWall Street analyst recommended a $750 billion. They are probably --
   they have moreexperience in this particular field than I have, but
   3,000 airplanes at $30 million a copy comesout to $90 billion, and
   this is an order of magnitude above that. So I told him I had
   difficultywith that particular figure. Another area was -- in the
   article here, I just noticed and I'm sorry Ididn't the first time I
   read this -- airplanes will roll out in 2005. That's true of the test
   articles. The first operational airplane will be available in 2008.
   And the third piece that he brings in isthe fact that -- alluding to
   the fact that perhaps the Navy would possibly in the future notsupport
   the program as strongly as the other services. I think -- I disagree
   with that. AdmiralBoorda has told me several times that he fully
   supports this and needs the aircraft, and the Navyis fully behind it.
   Other than that, sir, I think it's on target.

   <p>WARNER: All right. Let's address then the funding profile -- $131
   million in fiscal '96. That was -- excuse me -- that was a cut of $131
   million off a baseline of what figure?

   <p>STEIDLE: Approximately $331, sir. It brought us down to about $200
   million in '96.

   <p>WARNER: Those figures -- you're going to stick with them?

   <p>STEIDLE: I'm going to refine them in just a second, sir.

   <p>WARNER: All right.

   <p>STEIDLE: I'll give you the exact figures there within plus or minus
   two or three million, sir.

   <p>WARNER: You know, while he's getting to the figures, I have to recount
   when I used totestify as Secretary of the Navy, we would literally
   have two dolly carts full of records behindus. And now I guess with
   the modern computer and brighter officers, we're able to to it with
   ahandful of papers.

   <p>STEIDLE: Or submit a lot for the record. Sir, the exact figures...

   <p>WARNER: All right.

   <p>STEIDLE: I'm sorry, we started out with $345 million and went to $206
   million.

   <p>WARNER: Before -- OK, tell us what was the impact of that cut, then.
   Those are somefairly hefty bucks.

   <p>STEIDLE: Yes, sir. If I could just step back for just a second from
   where the programstarted. It started in the Bottoms-Up Review in '93.
   At that particular time, the AFX programand the multi-roller fighter
   airplane were cancelled, were rolled into one in this
   particularprogram.

   <p>Mr. Deutch in August of that year established a program with a
   memorandum and laid in awedge at that particular time in '93 for the
   program. Since that particular time, we've merged theA-STOVL program
   into it. We've gone from a technology demonstration to an actual
   strikefighter program and the wedge stayed in the same shape. And
   that's not appropriate for aDEM-VAL or development program. You need
   up front funds and the shape of the curveshould be a bell-curve skewed
   to the left.

   <p>I went forward in August and July of last year with redefining the
   program as we put somemore substance on it. Went forward and then came
   on over here to several of the staffs in lateAugust or September time
   frame, after it had gone past your particular committee with this
   newfunding profile. I presented a profile that was going to use '96
   funding to be able to do work in'97. That funding was quickly removed
   and the statement was put in that that funding should beapplied in
   '97. That was two year money. We could do that.

   <p>The services came forward with a program decision memorandum in
   September fully fundingthe program to the new DEM-VAL profile that
   we're executing today. So, in answer to yourquestion, sir, the bottom
   line is we reshaped the program and we have the money in the rightyear
   and the funding profile was correct to execute.

   <p>WARNER: What time sequence was it adjusted?

   <p>STEIDLE: We moved the program four months to the right. I looked at
   some techmaturation programs that we're doing. We moved those in the
   out years. We looked forredundancies and shelved a few of those
   particular programs. Moved the end point out fourmonths. And the total
   program was then reshaped and moved to the right slightly.

   <p>WARNER: I may return to that program, but I'll have a question for
   Admiral McGinn andthen refer to my colleague. The old EA-6B -- what a
   workhorse.

   <p>MCGINN: Yes, sir.

   <p>WARNER: I think the taxpayers got their money's worth out of that
   plane, wouldn't yousay?

   <p>MCGINN: They continue to get it Senator.

   <p>WARNER: No question about it. The committee has waited for some time
   for thecompleted studies of Airborne Electronic Warfare Requirements.
   Despite DOD'sunresponsiveness, last year's Defense authorization bill
   included generous funding for theelectronic warfare upgrades and
   modifications. The committee's concerned that delays inmaking
   substantial upgrades EA-6B will prevent the Navy from capitalizing on
   prior investingin the advance capability, that's the ADV cap. Is the
   Navy now ready to move out on thisprogram and make it a substantial
   commitment to near term EW capability?

   <p>STEIDLE: Yes, sir, we are. We continued to wisely use the funds that
   Congress providedlast year, the $165 million. We spent 100 million of
   that dollars -- or we are spending 100million of that dollars in
   upgrading 20 aircraft to the block 89, the more modern block
   89configuration. We spent an additional $40 million to get what we
   call band nine and tenelectronic warfare transmitter pods. And the
   final $25 million is going for 30 pods forcommunications jamming.

   <p>In addition to that, we have R&D programs that are ongoing to address
   the idea of a reactivejamming capability, something that you can use
   against a variety of threats. With theproliferation of First World
   weapons systems throughout many, many different areas of interestto
   the United States, we are concerned that we don't get so stabilized
   and solidified in aparticular threat system that we can't react
   agilely through additional threat systems that could beput together
   with money by a nation with interests counter to ours. So the reactive
   jamming isone answer to help us to be able to fly with confidence into
   an enemy air defense system in anyuncertain future.

   <p>WARNER: I'm going to ask General Magnus a question on JAST. And mister
   recorder, canyou put the general's response following Rear Admiral
   Steidle's JAST comments so we've gotthat one placed in the record.

   <p>General, is your invitation letter -- that is in our invitation -- we
   asked you about the MarineCorps view of JAST program. How would you
   describe the relevance of that program to thefuture of the Marine
   Corps aviation?

   <p>MAGNUS: Mr. Chairman, I'm glad that you asked me that question because
   I had theopportunity this morning to speak to the commandant, General
   Krulak, exactly on that topic.

   <p>WARNER: This morning?

   <p>MAGNUS: This morning, sir.

   <p>WARNER: You guys got off to a good, early start over there, didn't
   you?

   <p>MAGNUS: Yes, sir. As I've said, sir, readiness is your Corps. The
   Marine Corps has madethe commitment in a real sense...

   <p>WARNER: You got a little sleep along the way, though, I served in the
   Marines for manyyears without any sleep, and I assure you that it
   helps.

   <p>MAGNUS: The Marine Corps has made the commitment in a very real way to
   acceptnear-term risk in our strike fire community, our AV-8B Harriers
   and our F/A-18s. We're puttingour, literally our investment, our money
   where our mouth is, and the technology leap that wesee is in the joint
   strike fighter program.

   <p>We believe that we and the nation, our wingmen in the Air Force as
   well as our shipmates inthe Navy, urgently need the joint strike
   fighter, and we believe from our perspective in the Corpsthat now is
   the time to take the incremental degree of risk, we think, with the
   forces that wehave, looking at the threats that are in the next
   decade, to take that leap to 2008 to the joint strikefighter.

   <p>WARNER: OK, so you're still on board.

   <p>MAGNUS: Yes, sir. We're in the lead as far as our IOC requirements,
   and we joined,welded at the hip with the Air Force and the Navy in the
   urgent need for this affordable,survivable family of over 2800 joint
   aircraft.

   <p>WARNER: Thank you. Senator Levin.

   <p>LEVIN: Just one question on the JAST program. Admiral Steidle, the
   press has reportedrecently there's some problems with the release of
   proprietary information to competingcontractors by the JAST office.
   Can you describe what has happened and whether this is a significant
   problem?

   <p>STEIDLE: Yes, sir. Well, there was, indeed, proprietary information.
   There was aninadvertent disclosure, unfortunately, at the fax machine.
   An enclosure to one particular letterwas put into two other letters
   that went out to the competing contractors.

   <p>So therefore certain pricing and costing information from one
   contractor went to the othertwo. The two particular contractors saw
   that immediately, wrapped it up. I sent my securityofficer out there
   after it. We have statements to that effect, and we are providing
   information tothe contractor whose information was sent. I hope to
   have it completely resolved by Wednesdayand the release of our RFP on
   Thursday of next week.

   <p>WARNER: Would you yield to me?

   <p>LEVIN: Sure.

   <p>WARNER: I -- at an appropriate time, if you're going to continue with
   JAST.

   <p>LEVIN: No, I'm done with JAST.

   <p>WARNER: I think, Admiral Steidle, you should -- even those this is a
   purple program thatyou're operating -- what's the Navy's perspective
   on JAST meeting its requirements in the outyear -- operational
   requirements?

   <p>STEIDLE: Sir, could I have Admiral McGinn that, sir?

   <p>MCGINN: Just as General Magnus stated, we are firmly onboard with the
   JAST program,Senator. Our need in terms of timing isn't as urgent as
   the Marine Corps in the 2007, 2008timeframe. But we have a road map to
   the future that involves going from where we are todaywith the types
   of aircraft and our air wings, using the significant increase in
   capability of theF-18EF and then blending that in a complementary way
   with JAST when it comes onboardNavy aircraft carriers in about the
   2010 to 2012 timeframe -- about three to four years after theMarine
   Corps.

   <p>WARNER: General Eberhart, for the Department of the Air Force...

   <p>EBERHART: Yes, sir.

   <p>WARNER: Is it likewise your...

   <p>EBERHART: Yes, sir. It would sound like a recording. We're completely
   behind it, and weare. It's key to the Air Force of the future.

   <p>WARNER: And in all, then, this joint program is working out well? As a
   matter of fact, Ithink your deputy, Admiral Steidle, is a BG selectee?

   <p>STEIDLE: Yes, sir, he is. Yes, sir, the Air Force's newest general,
   sir.

   <p>WARNER: Good. That's fine.

   <p>STEIDLE: If he doesn't mess up JAST.

   <p>WARNER: So we don't know whether you're really a general for about 10,
   15 more yearsthen? Only thing I can tell you, colonel, general or
   whatever the case may be -- I knew GeneralEberhart when he was a
   major. So somehow he's made it, despite his association with membersof
   Congress. All right. Excuse me, thank you. Colleague, I'd like to get
   that one JAST thing inthe record altogether.

   <p>LEVIN: Well, the follow-up on that JAST question would be you say that
   the competitorwhose proprietary information was inadvertently
   disclosed has now been informed of that?

   <p>STEIDLE: He has been informed, sir. And I will go down on Wednesday of
   next week andpresent our investigation to them. That particular
   contractor issued a agency protest -- rightfullyso, in my mind.

   <p>STEIDLE: I will present all the information to him, and tell him what
   our investigation inimpact of the disclosure of that material has.

   <p>LEVIN: So, we really don't know yet what the effect is going to be.
   It's not been resolvedyet?

   <p>STEIDLE: No, sir, it is not. No, sir, it is not. By Wednesday I'll
   have it finished.

   <p>LEVIN: If you'd let us know the outcome of that for the record, it
   would be helpful.

   <p>STEIDLE: Wilco. Yes, sir.

   <p>WARNER: Just as a follow-on, Senator. Your program has recently
   progressed fromconcept exploration into the requirements generation
   and validation process. What will be thecritical two or three events
   between now and the award of the EMD to produce test aircraft? What
   has to go right, what could go wrong?

   <p>STEIDLE: Yes, sir. We're starting...

   <p>WARNER: Great staff question.

   <p>STEIDLE: Yes, sir.

   <p>STEIDLE: We're doing business differently, Senator. We have this group
   ofcost/performance trades. It's never been done at that level before.
   Industry is a full partner ofthis. We are trading off the requirements
   base that each one of the services have allowed us alarge envelope to
   work in as we pull it down.

   <p>Moving into the development phase, we'll award the two contracts to
   the two teams. Theywill have to demonstrate their ability to build
   this airplane with a high level of commonality,which significantly
   reduces the cost, demonstrate hover in transition, demonstrate
   carriersuitable flying quality, and continue on with the ground
   demonstration of technologymaturation. We need to mature the
   technologies before we go into the EMD program. That'll bedone.

   <p>And our ORD will be completely finished by the year '99. And that's a
   process in itself thatis being done in the virtual world in modeling
   and simulation. So it's a significant change fromthe way we have done
   business in the past.

   <p>LEVIN: Let me get to the data link issue on the fighter aircraft,
   general. Apparently, gettingtactical data links into the fighters has
   been a difficult issue for the Air Force for a number of years. Some
   have the perception that the Air Force has resisted adding that
   capability, not justbecause of cost but because of cultural barriers.
   I'm convinced that the added situational aware that sharing the data
   among various platforms would provide has tremendous potential for us.

   <p>Are there fighter data links included in the com-links that the chief
   of staff has added to hislist, do you know?

   <p>EBERHART: Yes, sir, there are.

   <p>LEVIN: And is the...

   <p>EBERHART: It's under the guise of sensor shooter, and under that...

   <p>LEVIN: Would you just say that again?

   <p>EBERHART: It's under the title sensor to shooter, and under that are
   the things that you're soconcerned of and so are we. And you're spot
   on, it was a cultural problem for a while, and in myview we might have
   hid behind the money issue. We're committed now, we realize
   howimportant it is to joint war fighting, and we're moving ahead.

   <p>LEVIN: All right. And General Magnus, is the Marines committed to also
   adopt thatcapability?

   <p>MAGNUS: Senator, we are. We, of course, field our aircraft in a common
   long-range planwith the United States Navy and a program that is
   unique to us, having taken over the AdvancedTechnical Air
   Reconnaissance System. For example, we have added a data link pod to
   thatsystem so that when it is fielded it will not only give us the
   capability to download thereconnaissance when we get to the ground,
   but will be able to give near real time bursts of thatcritical
   tactical battlefield information to joint force commanders and forces
   at sea.

   <p>LEVIN: OK. Admiral McGinn do you want to add anything to that?

   <p>MCGINN: Yes, sir. We are already flying in many of our aircraft
   including the F-14 D, theJ-TDS, or LINK-16, which we have found
   provides tremendously increased situationalawareness and it allows
   aircraft in a particular strike package or fighter sweep to coordinate
   their efforts in a much better way than we've ever been able to do
   before.

   <p>I'd like to also say that a Marine program that offers a great deal of
   promise that has beenfielded and prototyped is a digitalization called
   Automatic Target Hand-Off System whichallows a Marine on the ground
   under fire to digitally communicate right into the aircraftweapons
   system, in this case the AV-8B, but it will -- we're looking to field
   it in all of ourFA-18s as well. You know, actually put the symbol of
   the target that the Marine Lance Corporal in the trenches wants to
   hit, needs to hit, right on the heads-up display of the fighter
   aircraft orthe AV-8B. And it is a tremendous leap forward in close air
   support capability for the future. And General Magnus might want to
   comment further on that, sir.

   <p>MAGNUS: And I appreciate the comments of my shipmate, Admiral McGinn,
   theAutomatic Target Hand-Off System because exactly right, our forward
   observers, forward aircontrollers on the ground will be able to take
   the standard 9 line immediate air support requestand beam it up via
   data link just as the Admiral said, so the pilot in a strike aircraft
   that is lineof sight, but out of visual range will be able to stand
   off from the threat, receive the informationand roll in on the target.
   Coupling that capability with the emerging 1760 BUS digital
   capabilityin weapons like JDAM and JSOW, we are literally going to be
   able to deliver close air supportto troops on the ground at night
   through the weather in the future with precision, accuracy,because of
   the capability to pass that information up and then load it down into
   the weapons.

   <p>LEVIN: Are we funding that program as much as we -- in a robust way,
   we, in this budget?

   <p>MCGINN: I'd love to get an answer for you for the record Senator on
   that.

   <p>LEVIN: And General, I take it from your answer that the Air Force is
   now committed tohaving the same kind of reliance on the tactical data
   links in it's fighter aircraft as we've justheard described by the
   Navy and the Marines.

   <p>EBERHART: Yes, sir, to put a little more bluntly but you referenced it
   earlier. We're overour cultural problem that we had. And then to take
   it one step further, exactly what they just discussed, this interface
   between the digitalization of the ground battle and the air battle is
   key. In the past when we did look at it, we looked at it more of just
   digitalization of the air, and datalink in the air. And working that
   together is how we really become efficient. And then, oh, bythe way,
   reduce fratricide.

   <p>LEVIN: Well, it's good news to hear your testimony this morning, and
   the budget numberswill be helpful if you'll submit those.

   <p>EBERHART: Yes, sir.

   <p>LEVIN: Because that -- that's an area of top priority for this
   committee and has been for anumber of years.

   <p>WARNER: General Magnus, would you please pass on to your senior chief
   of aviation ourbest wishes for a speedy recovery from his operation
   and so forth?

   <p>MAGNUS: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. General Blot is recovering well. He
   has hadshoulder surgery, for your information. And the reason why he's
   not here is obviously he's fairlyuncomfortable -- doing very well but
   couldn't get into his uniform. So he sent me to speak toyou this
   morning.

   <p>WARNER: Glad to have you. Let's talk about your CV-22 and the problems
   that have been expressed by the retiring chief of the U.S. special
   operations command. What do you have toenlighten us on that? Have you
   read that article? If not, I'll send it up so you can skim it for
   aminute.

   <p>MAGNUS: I'm not sure which article to which you're referring --
   although there have beenseveral that I've read in the last few days.

   <p>WARNER: Well, let's work off the the same baseline, and I'll go to
   another question.

   <p>MAGNUS: Mr. Chairman, I am familiar with this article.

   <p>WARNER: Well, why don't you go ahead then?

   <p>MAGNUS: The joint V-22 program, I believe, is a success story, and of
   course like manyother large programs that are in engineering and
   manufacturing development we're constantlychallenged by constrained
   fiscal resources.

   <p>When the Department of Defense had a defense acquisition board and a
   defense resourcesboard in 1994 joining the U.S. Air Force Special
   Operations Command requirement for a specialoperations force CV-22 to
   the Marine Corps MV-22, the estimate for the development of theCV-22
   -- the U.S. Special Operations Command variant -- was $550 million.

   <p>And that estimate came from the United States Air Force, I believe it
   was AeronauticalSystems Command. Subsequent to that, the Department of
   the Navy committed, withDepartment of the Navy RDT&E money, to fund
   that $550 million profile that we believedwould be adequate to provide
   to take the MV-22 baseline aircraft into a Special Operationsvariant.

   <p>In the succeeding two years, Special Operations Command has defined
   its configurationmuch more finely than they had in '94. We -- the
   program office and Naval Air SystemsCommand submitted a request for a
   proposal for the development effort to the Bell-Boeing jointteam.

   <p>And essentially, the response from the contractors came in at
   approximately $200 millionover what was allocated in the budget.
   Clearly, that presented more than a minor challengebecause we did not
   have, in the Department of the Navy, that additional $200 million.

   <p>And something had to move, and we certainly recognized the Special
   Operations Commandrequirements as well as their need for a fiscal year
   2005 IOC.

   <p>There have been a number of meetings between the Assistant Secretary
   of the Navy forResearch and Development, Mr. Douglas, and the U.S.
   Special Operations Commandrepresentatives on alternatives in which we
   believe there are more than one alternative andwhich within the Navy's
   commitment to the $550 million we can -- with ideas such as preplanned
   product improvement -- provide exactly the kind of aircraft that
   Special OperationsCommand and our Air Force wing men need to be able
   to accomplish their critical mission.

   <p>MAGNUS: There are ongoing discussions between Special Operations
   Command and theUnited States Navy. OSD has been involved in the
   overarching team that is watching thisprogram closely. And we have
   been, of course, in consultation with our Air Force wingmen.We believe
   there are more than one solution that will allow us to execute to our
   $550 millioncommitment and provide the Air Force Special Operations
   Command the aircraft that they needwhen they need it.

   <p>WARNER: That's reassuring and Douglas is a very able man, trained here
   by thiscommission, and I have a high degree of confidence, as do other
   members.

   <p>Do you want to take a question or I'll...

   <p>LEVIN: Just on the V-22 issue. There have been some, another press
   report relating totesting results on the V-22 which indicates some
   problems, unacceptable level of down draft orprop wash below the
   aircraft operating, when it operates at hover. Is there going to be
   anopportunity during the operational testing to determine whether or
   not that condition is real.

   <p>MAGNUS: Senator, thank you very much for that question. We have been
   aware -- and Isay we in a personal sense -- have been aware of the
   down wash effect of tilt rotors, not onlyfrom our experience with high
   velocity down wash aircraft such as V-stal , but when I was a major I
   was on the joint NASA-Army-Navy-Air Force and Industry team that went
   out to NASAAmes and modeled the aircraft that was then being designed
   call JVX, which has since becomethe V-22 Osprey tilt rotor.

   <p>We were well aware that the velocity and the footprint, if you will,
   of the air that is movingdown was going to be more than we have in the
   current medium helicopters, but, quite frankly,comparable to heavy
   lift helicopters, such as the CH-53 Echo; different, but comparable to
   it.

   <p>In other words, that we knew that people who were operating in the
   vicinity underneath theaircraft would have a high velocity down wash.
   And we anticipated this, so this is not asurprise. As a result of
   that, during our operational tests we have just completed operation
   test2B, which focused specifically on this issue. We better understand
   how ground combat marines,sailors and soldiers will operate under
   aircraft that are being flown by Air Force, Navy andMarine Corps
   pilots, and we believe, and I have personally read the comments of
   marinehelicopter support team members, lance corporals who have worked
   under these aircraft, whobasically say it is comparable to their CH-53
   Echo experience.

   <p>What I can tell you is, just like the CH-53 Echo, which went through
   it op eval in 1979, andthere were words in the report there that
   described it as dangerous and requiring specialequipment that we
   didn't have in 1979, we will find tactics, techniques and procedures
   that willallow us to safely and effectively utilize this aircraft. We
   have anticipated this problem and weare working with our joint wingmen
   on this as well as the people who will actually be the realcustomers
   of the aircraft, and that's the troops that'll be in the back. I'm
   confident that this willbe resolved.

   <p>LEVIN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

   <p>WARNER: This is a question to all three. We'll ask General Eberhart,
   Admiral McGinn andGeneral Magnus to answer.

   <p>WARNER: Over the years, the committee has taken an active interest in
   airborne. Part ofthis has been addressed, but the senator and I want
   to make sure that there is nothing left in this untouched. The
   committee has taken an active interest in airborne electronic warfare.
   Aninitiative by the committee a few years ago was encouraged by the
   Defense Department toconsolidate airborne EW into one program and to
   adequately fund that program. Today we havean aged EA-6B fleet which
   -- with much the same capability as in the years past, while the
   threatexpands and becomes more sophisticated. At the same time, the
   Air Force plans to retire EF-111. What is the importance of airborne
   electronic warfare to your tactical aviation program? What near-term
   capabilities do you have to address that threat, General, to the
   extent you haven'tcovered it already?

   <p>EBERHART: Yes, sir. Obviously, airborne ECM is very important to our
   program and thesurvival of our pilots and our effectiveness on the
   battlefield.

   <p>We support the efforts that are ongoing to build the EA-6B fleet up,
   make improvements toit, to provide for our joint ECM requirements.
   We're part of the solution there, and not part ofthe problem. We're
   committed to it.

   <p>However, at the same time, I have to tell you that we have an
   insurance policy there in that aswe draw down the EF-111s, we keep
   them around till the -- the number's classified -- butsometime in '98.
   We can an increased crew-to-aircraft ratio, and the airplanes that we
   do retirewe don't take the date as moth them, we leave on the ramp.

   <p>So if there is a hiccough or we have a requirement, then we can fall
   back on it. But we'recommitted to it. We want it to work. We know it's
   the right thing to do.

   <p>You know, and the committee knows as well as I do, that we have to
   approach this problemfrom many different ways. In addition to airborne
   ECM, if we have better battlespace awarenessin terms of increased
   intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance so we know where
   thethreats are, we know what the threats can do, we know how to either
   attack them or avoid them,using Stealth and using PGM.

   <p>We also have the nonlethal part of this, and eventually some day we
   think there will beinformation warfare ways to get in and help us
   survive in the battlefield of the future. And wethink it's important
   to work all of these aspects, and that's what we're committed to.

   <p>WARNER: Admiral McGinn?

   <p>MCGINN: I fully concur with General Eberhart's remarks, Senator, and
   I'd like to just add afew of my own. The EA-6B is, as mature an
   airframe and engine combination as it is, still enjoys a great deal of
   service life that is available to it.

   <p>We have an active and ongoing operational safety improvement program
   that is closelymonitored by engineers and air crewmen and maintenance
   personnel in the field as well as at thevarious systems commands. It
   is a truly joint program in that later this month, the three
   servicechiefs will sign a memorandum of agreement that will solidify
   the progress that we have madein making the EA-6B fleet truly the
   nation's tactical EW force. I received a report from the wingcommander
   -- the EA-6B wing commander -- two weeks ago as well as one of the
   EA-6Bsquadron COs who had just returned from deployment over in the
   Mediterranean. They areabsolutely confident that the program is on
   track. It is properly resourced in terms of airframes,the equipment
   upgrades that are going in now and are planned, as well as the air
   crew upgradesas well. We have Air Force air crews flying in EA-6Bs in
   training as well as in operations, andthey have also coordinated at
   the EA-6B wing level with all of the services and all of the
   unifiedcommanders in chiefs and their staffs to make sure that the
   global coverage exists in terms offorward presence as well as a very
   responsive reaction capability should that be required in anytype of a
   regional contingency.

   <p>WARNER: General.

   <p>MAGNUS: Mr. Chairman, I agree with the remarks of General Eberhart and
   AdmiralMcGinn. The Marine Corps, as you know, has four squadrons of
   prowlers in the ICAP-2configuration. We along with the Navy are
   operating our aircraft to the Block-89 Alphaconfiguration.

   <p>As I told you earlier in the hearing, Marines are on the ground today
   in Aviano and earlierlast year when there was the need to bring
   additional tactical aircraft into the theaters to supportstrikes that
   were needed on the ground, Marine squadrons deployed within 48 hours
   and wasflying combat missions on the third day from the time that they
   got the to order from the JointChiefs of Staffs.

   <p>We were integrated with the Navy in carrier deployments as well as
   basing out of our base atIwakuni, Japan. We will support the United
   States Navy in fulfilling our importantresponsibilities in the
   Department of the Navy to provide aircraft not only for our own
   supportrequirements but to support the United Sates Air Force and our
   allies.

   <p>Of course, the United States Navy has received a budgetary FYSYP up
   and some structure totake up the Air Force's EF-111 mission as those
   aircraft stand down. Nevertheless, andconsistent with the tactical
   aviation integration memorandum of agreement that the Commandant of
   the Marine Corps and the Chief of Naval Operations have in general
   about allof our strike and electronic warfare aircraft, we will
   support the United States Navy in fulfillingour commitments to the
   nation.

   <p>WARNER: Senator Levin. Gentlemen, I'm going to have to absent myself
   and mydistinguished colleague will wrap up the hearing. Thank you very
   much.

   <p>LEVIN: General, I want to talk to you about F-16s for a minute. We've
   got a new definitionof service life of the F-16s which is now driving
   us to purchase some additional F-16s. Andthere's a real question about
   whether that's the right way to go given our other needs in the
   AirForce. But let me try to work through this number with you. We have
   a 20 wing fighter forcenow and I gather the portion of that force that
   is made of F-16s is somewhat more than half. Doyou know off hand if
   that's correct?

   <p>EBERHART: Sir, that sounds correct. I'll get the number here as you...

   <p>LEVIN: OK, well, than maybe I better get these numbers for the record.

   <p>EBERHART: Yes, sir.

   <p>LEVIN: Let me tell you what I need, because you may not have them at
   your fingertips. What I need to know is what was the F-16 requirement
   when we had a 26-wing force, what wasthe F-16 requirement now, what
   would it have been had we gone to a 36-wing force, which was the goal
   during the early '90s?

   <p>Those three items I need and how many F-16s would have made up those
   three differentforce structures. Then I need you to translate that
   into both the old definition and the newdefinition of service life in
   terms of how many available F-16s we got. And that's somethingyou can
   provide us for the record.

   <p>EBERHART: Yes, sir.

   <p>LEVIN: Do you know in general whether or not the number of F-16
   fighter wingequivalence has changed over the recent past? Do you know
   that offhand?

   <p>EBERHART: Sir, it is changed, obviously, as we've drawn down some
   F-16s, and we canthink of wings like the 474th at Nellis and other
   wings that have drawn down. And as airplaneshave aged, it's certainly
   changed, although the other fighter force structure is changed, too.

   <p>So I don't have on the tip of my tongue what the relationship in terms
   of proportion of forceis in terms of change, but we'd like to show
   that to you for the record and the proportion of thedifferent blocks,
   how they've changed...

   <p>LEVIN: All right.

   <p>EBERHART: ...because that's what complicates this issue, as you know.

   <p>LEVIN: Right. That's fine. Are you familiar with the Coalition Force
   EnhancementProgram? Does that strike a bell?

   <p>EBERHART: I think I...no, sir.

   <p>LEVIN: OK. This was a program that would have given the F-16s some
   improvedcapability, upgraded them, added some service life. And we can
   find that in a different way.

   <p>EBERHART: Yes, sir, I am familiar with that program.

   <p>LEVIN: OK. Was it our plan to use that program and sell those upgraded
   F-16 to our allies?

   <p>EBERHART: Sir, our hope was to do just that and then have a device or
   a procedure wherethat money is supposed to be returned to the Treasury
   would be returned to the United States AirForce to buy these attrition
   reserve airplanes that we've just discussed.

   <p>LEVIN: Do you know the cost of adding 4000 hours of service life to a
   plane under thatprogram?

   <p>EBERHART: No, sir, I do not know. One of our big problems right now is
   that as we'velooked around on this and how much we would have to sell
   those for, I think the brutal facts arethere are no buyers.

   <p>LEVIN: They want to...

   <p>EBERHART: Just as soon have a new airplane.

   <p>LEVIN: All right. Now, are you familiar with the JSTARS budget request
   in the currentbudget?

   <p>EBERHART: Yes, sir.

   <p>LEVIN: As I understand it, the budget would cut the JSTARS procurement
   in half duringfiscal years '99, 2000, and 2001, buying one instead of
   two during those fiscal years?

   <p>EBERHART: Sir, my recollection was that we did, in fact, move one
   airplane right. I wasn'taware that we moved three right. I thought we
   moved one right. I'll have to provide that for therecord.

   <p>LEVIN: Can you tell us what the experience with the J-STARS was in the
   Persian Gulf War,in Bosnia?

   <p>LEVIN: Are the CINCs interested in more JSTARS?

   <p>EBERHART: Sir, the CINCs are very interested in the JSTARS program as
   it exists todayand the planned improvements as we get on through the
   production line.

   <p>Obviously, as you know, the bird that we have today and the production
   birds will be muchmore capable than the bird that we had in the
   Persian Gulf. And that -- we were all amazed bywhat it was able to do
   in such short notice.

   <p>I think that in Bosnia today, people are impressed with what it's
   doing, although it's adifferent situation because of the topography,
   we don't have a pool table, if you will, like we hadin Desert Storm or
   like we imagined in the central region of Europe.

   <p>But we have tools where we can go and take this and show the CINC that
   if you bringJSTARS here and you put it in this orbit, this is what
   you're going to be able to see aroundSarajevo. This is what you're not
   going to be able to see. So that the expectations are there andhe
   fully understands what this tool will bring to him as a CINC. And
   that's exactly what we didbefore we deployed JSTARS, so it's living up
   to the expectations, and it's allowing us to use it inways in
   peacekeeping and peace making that we hadn't envisioned using in a
   major regionalcontingency. So everybody's very impressed with what
   they see in terms of JSTARS now. Andfrankly, the move right was an
   affordability issue to make sure that everything would fit.

   <p>LEVIN: Well, that's what troubles me is that we've got a new
   technology and a newplatform, which is working extremely well from
   everything we can learn, and we're moving thatto the right for
   affordability reasons.

   <p>And then, we're spending money buying F-16s and F-15s for attrition
   reserves, which areonly created by the changing the program life
   expectancy of planes. And where planes could beupgrades quite easily,
   as a matter of fact, if necessary in order to extend that program
   life.

   <p>I mean, it just seems to me there's a disconnect here where we've got
   a real need of a newtechnology that is proving itself every day in
   Bosnia and has proven itself in -- over many, manymonths in the
   Persian Gulf, and that we're delaying and using money to create a
   reserve whichreally, it seems to me, is not a realistic need when you
   consider the fact that we've reduced thenumber quite dramatically of
   how many F-16s we're going to need because of the reduction infighter
   wings.

   <p>So, to me, it's a priority which is misplaced, but I'm not asking you
   to agree or disagree withthat so much as I need from you for the
   record the history of the F-16s when we had 26 fighterwings. Now that
   it's down to 20 what would have been had we -- the requirement -- what
   therequirement would have been had we gone up to 35? The impact on the
   -- on that requirementwhen we changed the service life expectancy of
   the F-16 and then we can put all that togetherand reach our own
   conclusion. But at least that's certainly my tentative conclusion.

   <p>EBERHART: Sir, we'll certainly provide that and the chief shares your
   concerns there. Maybe not necessarily versus the F-16 but the
   importance of that JSTARS and we are relookingthat now as we build the
   '98 to '03 program.

   <p>LEVIN: OK. Thank you. And then my last question, General Magnus, has
   to do with theC130-J aircraft, and I understand that you'd like to
   begin buying a tanker version of that aircraft.Is that correct?

   <p>MAGNUS: Senator, our current active force has 37 35 year old KC130-Fs
   and an additional14 slightly younger KC130-Rs. Based upon what our
   projection of the service life of thoseaircraft are, unfortunately the
   bulk of them are going to come due for block service liferetirement
   just exactly when we need to invest in aircraft like the joint strike
   fighter and V-22and the Navy's F/A-18EF. We have been monitoring the
   United States Air Forces C130-J program. We are enormously impressed
   with the improvements in the cockpits and the avionicsin the
   performance of the air craft. We believe it would be prudent for us to
   be able toessentially piggy back on that program. Fiscal resource
   constraints have not enabled us to dothat at this time.

   <p>LEVIN: Now you just completed, did you not, the modernization of your
   tactical tankers acouple of years ago?

   <p>MAGNUS: That's correct. We still have some other things that are being
   modernized interms of radios, global position, satellite com. So,
   there is a continuing strain, but essentiallythat is correct.

   <p>LEVIN: And despite that recent completion of that modernization
   program, you want to startbuying some new tankers for reasons that you
   gave?

   <p>MAGNUS: Well, essentially the modernization that we're talking about,
   that the Senator isreferring to, is sub-systems. Our concern is
   service life, fatigue life of the aircraft. Theseaircraft are 35 years
   old. We would have to spend an enormous amount more money to basically
   do a service life extension on these aircraft when we have aircraft
   that are beingproduced for the United States Air Force. They're going
   to have very low ownership costs, justas ours are spiking.

   <p>So, we believe it prudent not to invest in schlepping old aircraft
   when in fact they're going tobe very cost effective in terms of life
   cycle costs and commonality. Very cost effective --C130-Js being
   produced for our wing men in the United States Air Force. So we look
   forward tobeing able to take advantage of that program.

   <p>LEVIN: Thank you all. Appreciate your testimony. We will stand
   adjourned.
