<h>Standish James O'Grady: between imperial romance and Irish Revival

   
   <p>The Elizabethan parallel reflects a longstanding interest, awakened by
   childhood encounters with Beara traditions of the 1601 siege of Dunboy
   and the chieftain Donal O'Sullivan Beare. O'Grady claimed that as a
   boy he asked an old man about the Gaelic chieftains, expecting tales
   of heroic valor, and was shocked to hear them called tyrants. (39)
   From the late 1880s O'Grady published on the subject. His arguments
   provoked unionists and nationalists alike.

   <p>O'Grady attacked the view, deriving from seventeenth-century
   historians such as Philip O'Sullivan Beare and the Four Masters and
   taken up by contemporary nationalists such as the Sullivan brothers
   (proud natives of Beara), that the chieftains who opposed Elizabeth
   led the Irish people in a fight for faith and fatherland against alien
   tyranny. O'Grady argued that they sought dynastic interests against a
   centralizing state. Chieftains represented as nationalist heroes
   pledged loyalty to the crown in the State Papers; he professed dismay
   that even Brian "of the Battleaxes" O'Rourke, whom O'Grady initially
   regarded as one of the few disinterested patriots involved,
   insincerely proffered loyalty to the crown, which executed his father,
   betraying associates as occasion suited. (40) Many rebellions were
   negotiating gambits "like a petition to parliament in our own day,"
   recognized as such by the crown if the rebels did not seek foreign
   aid. (41) O'Grady claimed the majority of the Irish people supported
   the crown. Trading towns preferred peace and security from a strong
   state; the common people found it less exacting than warring
   chieftains; many chieftains supported the crown from hostility to a
   tyrannical superior or usurping rival. (42) The rebel chieftains lost
   because they were united by no principle and betrayed one another from
   opportunism. (43) Hugh O'Neill was their only statesman, no better
   than his royalist counterparts; (44) Red Hugh O'Donnell (at least in
   his youthful escapes from captivity) their only hero--and O'Grady
   pointed out that Red Hugh's title was uncertain and that Nial Garbh
   O'Donnell, denounced by nationalists as a traitor, might legitimately
   claim a better right. (45) The priests and Jesuits who sided with the
   rebels were indeed heroes inspired by an ideal; their histories
   projected that ideal onto their unworthy allies. (46)

   <p>Nationalists found this interpretation disturbing. O'Grady's lecture
   on Elizabethan Ireland at Alexandra College in 1895 stirred up a
   lengthy correspondence in the Parnellite Irish Independent. Many
   participants denied that an Irish majority supported Elizabeth; others
   retorted that a majority supported Gladstone against Parnell. (47) As
   late as 1938, Michael Tierney protested that Sean O'Faolain's view of
   the Gaelic tradition as incompatible with modern statecraft revived
   O'Grady's apologia for conquest.
   

   <p>O'Grady's work could be used in the unionist case that the Irish had
   not created a state until the British imposed one that only unionists
   were competent to maintain, and that nationalist political
   incompetence nullified numerical superiority. In April 1889, when
   Ireland was convulsed by the Plan of Campaign, O'Grady wrote in the
   English Historical Review on "the Last Kings of Ireland," offering a
   similar interpretation of Irish dynastic conflicts in the eleventh and
   twelfth centuries. The Weekly Mail commented that the last High King,
   Roderick O'Connor, subdued Connacht "in a perfectly Balfourian
   manner," resembling the law enforcement activities of the contemporary
   RIC in the same province "while hot water and pitchforks are freely
   allowed to the defenders of 'humble homes'." The editorialist noted
   how after the Battle of Clontarf Brian Boru's army was ambushed by
