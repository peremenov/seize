   <h>ABSTRACT

   <p>OBJECTIVE: To compare treatment outcomes of open foot wounds with
   significant soft tissue defects using either negative pressure wound
   therapy (NPWT) or standard wet-to-moist saline-soaked gauze dressings.

   <p>SUBJECTS: Forty-seven subjects with open wounds with significant soft
   tissue defects.

   <p>DESJGN: A retrospective analysis of sequentially selected records of
   patients treated with NPWT or standard wetto-moist dressings.

   <p>RESULTS: Risk of complications, subsequent foot surgeries, and
   hospital readmissions (secondary outcomes) were all reduced by 70% or
   more for the patients treated with NPWT. Length of stay during
   readmissions tended to be shorter; rates of wound cavity filling and
   wound healing (primary outcomes) tended to be greater with NPWT,
   although the differences were not statistically significant.

   <p>CONCLUSION: Patients included in the study treated with NPWT had fewer
   foot-related complications, less additional foot surgery, and fewer
   readmissions for the study foot than did patients treated with
   standard therapy. Further research using randomized clinical trials is
   needed to confirm the findings of the current study's data.
   

   <p>CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Wound cavity filling time and time to complete
   closure were similar in both study groups, despite the fact that
   patients receiving NPWT were older, had larger wounds, and had poorer
   nutrition. NPWT may be an effective modality for the healing of open
   wounds with significant defects and for reducing subsequent care.

   <p>More than 2.8 million patients in the United States suffer from
   chronic wounds, costing billions of dollars annually. ' Prevalence of
   chronic ulcers has been estimated to be 120 per 100,000 patients
   between the ages of 45 and 64 years; prevalence increases to more than
   800 per 100,000 patients over age 75.2 Patients with diabetes have a
   15% lifetime risk of developing a foot ulcer and up to a 40-fold
   greater risk of lower-extremity amputation than do their counterparts
   without diabetes.3 Approximately 82,000 hospital discharges for
   diabetes-related nontraumatic amputations occurred in the United
   States in 2001, the last year for which published statistics are
   available.4 The 5-year survival rate following amputation of a
   diabetic limb is less than 50%.s/h

   <p>The causes of chronic wounds include nonhcaling diabetic, pressure, or
   vascular ulcers; cellulitis or osteomyelitis; wound dehiscencc; and
   trauma. Complicated ulcers often require aggressive debridcmcnt and/or
   open amputation, which can result in large soft tissue defects. These
   defects, in turn, may produce large, deep wounds with exposed bone,
   tendon, capsule, and muscle that are difficult and costly to heal.
   Often, these wounds are associated with further complications and the
   need for other surgical procedures.

   <p>As a consequence of the extreme morbidity, mortality, and cost of
   managing lower-extremity ulcérations and their complications, many
   modalities have been developed to improve wound closure. Among the
   newer technologies recently used to promote closure of such wounds is
   negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT; Vacuum Assisted Closure
   [V.A.C.] Advanced Therapy System; KCI, San Antonio, TX). Developed in
   the 1990s by researchers at Wake Forest University, NPWT has been used
   successfully to treat a variety of wounds, including surgical
   wounds,7-14 grafts15-19 diabetic foot ulccrs,20-23 and pressure
   ulcers,24-26 with the aim of increasing the rate of wound closure,
   increasing patient comfort, decreasing length of hospitalization, and
   reducing the cost of care.27-36 The persistence of senescent, chronic
   cells and protease-containing wound fluid at the wound interface is
   deleterious to wound healing.37-38 Therefore, it is theorized that
   NPWT aids in wound healing by removing excess interstitial fluids,
   increasing vascularity, decreasing bacterial colonization, and
   mechanically stimulating the surrounding tissues.39-41

   <p>NPWT has been used regularly since early 2000 by the Podiatry section
   at the CarlT. HaydenVA Medical Center (VA), Phoenix, AZ, for the
   management of open foot wounds with significant soft tissue defects.
   Initial impressions of its efficacy were favorable. The podiatry team
   desired to confirm or refute these impressions through a retrospective
   analysis of selected outcomes in patients treated with either NPWT or
   standard wet to moist dressings.

   <h>OBJECTIVES

   <p>The purpose of this study was to compare specific outcomes in groups
   of patients treated either with NPWT or with standard wet-to-moist,
   saline-soaked dressings for open foot wounds with significant soft
   tissue defects. The primary outcomes to be assessed were wound cavity
   filling time and total time to complete closure of the wound (Table
   1). secondary outcomes considered were other surgical procedures
   performed on the study foot, complications of the study foot, and
   number and length of readmissions for subsequent problems in the study
   foot. All secondary outcomes were assessed during the year following
   the definitive surgical procedure, which was performed just prior to
   initiation of NPWT or wet-to-moist gauze dressings.
