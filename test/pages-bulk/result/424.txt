    <h>  Overview>

   <p>The First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States declares
   that "Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech."
   What does and should this mean? Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, in his
   famous Abrams v. United States (1919) dissenting opinion, began what
   may be the single most poetic paragraph ever written by a Supreme
   Court justice on the meaning of freedom of speech. Here is that
   improbable opening line: "Persecution for the expression of opinions
   seems to me perfectly logical." What could Holmes have been thinking?

   <p>Perhaps Holmes was expressing the view that all of us, individually
   and collectively, have within us a kind of censorship-impulse.
   Governments are especially prone to censor. As Holmes went on to put
   it: "If you have no doubt of your premises or your power and want a
   certain result with all your heart you naturally express your wishes
   in law and sweep away all opposition." Censorship is thus a kind of
   social instinct. As caring and responsible citizens of society,
   especially good and decent citizens of a good and decent society, we
   are likely to want many results with all our hearts. We want security,
   we want freedom from fear, we want order, civility, racial and
   religious tolerance, we want the well-being of our children. We want
   these things with all our hearts, and when others express opinions
   that seem to threaten these aspirations, who can blame us for being
   tempted to express our wishes in law and sweep away the opposition? It
   is perfectly logical. And that is what, at bottom, freedom of speech
   is all about.

   <p>Over the course of roughly the last 50 years the U.S. Supreme Court
   has set our nation on a remarkable experiment, often construing the
   First Amendment in a manner that strenuously defies the natural and
   logical impulse to censor. In scores of decisions, the Supreme Court
   has interpreted the First Amendment in a manner that to most of the
   world seems positively radical. Those decisions are numerous and cover
   a vast and various terrain, but consider some highlights. Americans
   have the right to:

     <l>* Desecrate the national flag as a symbol of protest.
     <l>* Burn the cross as an expression of racial bigotry and hatred.
     <l>* Espouse the violent overthrow of the government as long as it is
       mere abstract advocacy and not an immediate incitement to
       violence.
     <l>* Traffic in sexually explicit erotica as long as it does not meet a
       rigorous definition of "hard core" obscenity.
     <l>* Defame public officials and public figures with falsehoods
       provided they are not published with knowledge of their falsity or
       reckless disregard for the truth.
     <l>* Disseminate information invading personal privacy if the
       revelation is deemed "newsworthy."
     <l>* Engage in countless other forms of expression that would be
       outlawed in many nations but are regarded as constitutionally
       protected here.

   <p>Such First Amendment decisions reject the impulse to censor; they are
   therefore striking as legal doctrines. Perhaps more striking, however,
   is that these decisions have gained widespread currency within
   American culture as a whole. The Supreme Court is not alone in its
   commitment to the free-speech project. While undoubtedly any one
   decision will often be controversial with the public, which may be
   deeply divided on topics such as flag-burning or sex on the Internet,
   on balance what is extraordinary about the evolution of freedom of
   speech in America over the last 50 years is that it has taken such a
   strong hold on the American consciousness, a hold that seems to cut
   across party labels such as "Democrat" or "Republican" or ideological
   labels such as "liberal" or "conservative." On the Supreme Court
   itself, for example, justices with hardy conservative credentials such
   as Antonin Scalia or Clarence Thomas have often been as committed to
   expansive protection for freedom of speech as justices famous for
   their liberal views, such as William Brennan or Thurgood Marshall.
   Appointees of Republican presidents, such as Anthony Kennedy or David
   Souter, have been as stalwart as appointees of Democratic presidents,
   such as Stephen Breyer or Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in their articulation
   of strong free-speech doctrines. So too, in the political arena, views
   on free-speech issues often do not track along traditional party lines
   or classic ideological divisions.

   <p>This is not to say that in some simplistic sense everybody in America
   believes in freedom of speech, and certainly it is not to say that
   everybody in America believes that freedom of speech means the same
   thing. But it is to say that in a sense both deep and wide, "freedom
   of speech" is a value that has become powerfully internalized by the
   American polity. Freedom of speech is a core American belief, almost a
   kind of secular religious tenet, an article of constitutional faith.

   <p>How do we account for the modern American reverence for freedom of
   speech? Why is this value so solidly entrenched in our constitutional
   law, and why is it so widely embraced by the general public? Over the
   years many philosophers, historians, legal scholars and judges have
   offered theoretical justifications for strong protection of freedom of
   speech, and in these justifications we may also find explanatory
   clues.

   <p>An obvious starting point is the direct link between freedom of speech
   and vibrant democracy. Free speech is an indispensable tool of
   self-governance in a democratic society. Concurring in Whitney v.
   California (1927), Justice Louis Brandeis wrote that "freedom to think
   as you will and to speak as you think are means indispensable to the
   discovery and spread of political truth."

   <p>On a communal level, free speech facilitates majority rule. It is
   through talking that we encourage consensus, that we form a collective
   will. Whether the answers we reach are wise or foolish, free speech
   helps us ensure that the answers usually conform to what most people
   think. Americans who are optimists (and optimism is a quintessentially
   American characteristic) additionally believe that, over the long run,
   free speech actually improves our political decision-making. Just as
   Americans generally believe in free markets in economic matters, they
   generally believe in free markets when it comes to ideas, and this
   includes politics. In the long run the best test of intelligent
   political policy is its power to gain acceptance at the ballot box.

   <p>On an individual level, speech is a means of participation, the
   vehicle through which individuals debate the issues of the day, cast
   their votes, and actively join in the processes of decision-making
   that shape the polity. Free speech serves the individualâs right to
   join the political fray, to stand up and be counted, to be an active
   player in the democracy, not a passive spectator.

   <p>Freedom of speech is also an essential contributor to the American
   belief in government confined by a system of checks and balances,
   operating as a restraint on tyranny, corruption and ineptitude. For
   much of the worldâs history, governments, following the impulse
   described by Justice Holmes, have presumed to play the role of
   benevolent but firm censor, on the theory that the wise governance of
   men proceeds from the wise governance of their opinions. But the
   United States was founded on the more cantankerous revolutionary
   principles of John Locke, who taught that under the social compact
   sovereignty always rests with the people, who never surrender their
   natural right to protest, or even revolt, when the state exceeds the
   limits of legitimate authority. Speech is thus a means of
   "people-power," through which the people may ferret out corruption and
   discourage tyrannical excesses.

   <p>Counter-intuitively, influential American voices have also often
   argued that robust protection of freedom of speech, including speech
   advocating crime and revolution, actually works to make the country
   more stable, increasing rather than decreasing our ability to maintain
   law and order. Again the words of Justice Brandeis in Whitney v.
   California are especially resonant, with his admonition that the
   framers of the Constitution "knew that order cannot be secured merely
   through fear of punishment for its infraction; that it is hazardous to
   discourage thought, hope and imagination; that fear breeds repression;
   that repression breeds hate; that hate menaces stable government; that
   the path of safety lies in the opportunity to discuss freely supposed
   grievances and proposed remedies; and that the fitting remedy for evil
   counsels is good ones." If a society as wide-open and pluralistic as
   America is not to explode from festering tensions and conflicts, there
   must be valves through which citizens with discontent may blow off
   steam. In America we have come to accept the wisdom that openness
   fosters resiliency, that peaceful protest displaces more violence than
   it triggers, and that free debate dissipates more hate than it stirs.

   <p>The link between speech and democracy certainly provides some
   explanation for the American veneration of free speech, but not an
   entirely satisfying or complete one. For there are many flourishing
   democracies in the world, but few of them have adopted either the
   constitutional law or the cultural traditions that support free speech
   as expansively as America does. Moreover, much of the vast protection
   we provide to expression in America seems to bear no obvious
   connection to politics or the democratic process at all. Additional
   explanation is required.

   <p>Probably the most celebrated attempt at explanation is the
   "marketplace of ideas" metaphor, a notion that is most famously
   associated with Holmes' great dissent in Abrams, in which he argued
   that "the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself
   accepted in the competition of the market." The marketplace of ideas
   metaphor does not posit that truth will emerge from the free trade in
   ideas, at least not instantly. That would be asking too much. It
   merely posits that free trade in ideas is the best test of truth, in
   much the same way that those who believe in laissez-faire economic
   theory argue that over the long haul free economic markets are
   superior to command-and-control economies. The American love of the
   marketplace of ideas metaphor stems in no small part from our
   irrepressible national optimism, the American "constitutional faith"
   that, given long enough, good will conquer evil. As long as this
   optimism is not blind naivetÃ©, but is rather a motive force that
   encourages us to keep the faith in the long view of history, it can be
   a self-fulfilling prophecy. Just as we often have nothing to fear but
   fear, hope is often our best hope. Humanity may be fallible, and truth
   illusive, but the hope of humanity lies in its faith in progress. The
   marketplace metaphor reminds us to take the long view. Americans like
   to believe, and largely do believe, that truth has a stubborn and
   incorrigible persistence. Cut down again and again, truth will still
   not be extinguished. Truth will out, it will be rediscovered and
   rejuvenated. It will prevail.

   <p>The connection of freedom of speech to self-governance and the appeal
   of the marketplace of ideas metaphor still, however, do not tell it
   all. Freedom of speech is linked not merely to such grandiose ends as
   the service of the democracy or the search for truth. Freedom of
   speech has value on a more personal and individual level. Freedom of
   speech is part of the human personality itself, a value intimately
   intertwined with human autonomy and dignity. In the words of Justice
   Thurgood Marshall in the 1974 case Procunier v. Martinez, "The First
   Amendment serves not only the needs of the polity but also those of
   the human spirit -- a spirit that demands self-expression."

   <p>Many Americans embrace freedom of speech for the same reasons they
   embrace other aspects of individualism. Freedom of speech is the right
   to defiantly, robustly and irreverently speak oneâs mind just because
   it is oneâs mind. Freedom of speech is thus bonded in special and
   unique ways to the human capacity to think, imagine and create.
   Conscience and consciousness are the sacred precincts of mind and
   soul. Freedom of speech is intimately linked to freedom of thought, to
   that central capacity to reason and wonder, hope and believe, that
   largely defines our humanity.

   <p>If these various elements of our culture do in combination provide
   some insight into why freedom of speech exerts such a dominating
   presence on the American legal and cultural landscape, they do not by
   any means come close to explaining the intense and seemingly
   never-ending legal and cultural debates over the limits on freedom of
   speech.

   <p>There are limits. The major labor of modern First Amendment law is to
   articulate the points at which those limits are reached. This ongoing
   process is often contentious and difficult, and no one simple legal
   formula or philosophical principle has yet been discovered that is up
   to the trick of making the job easy. Americans thus continue to debate
   in political forums and litigate in legal forums such issues as the
   power of society to censor offensive speech to protect children, the
   power to arrest speakers spreading violent or hateful propaganda for
   fear that it will foment crime or terrorism, the permissibility of
   banning speech that defeats protection of intellectual property, the
   propriety of curbing speech to shelter personal reputation and
   privacy, the right to restrict political contributions and
   expenditures to reduce the influence of money on the political
   process, and countless other free-speech conflicts.

   <p>Yet while the country continues to struggle mightily to define the
   limits and continues to debate vigorously the details, there is
   surprisingly little struggle and debate over the core of the faith.
   Americans truly do embrace the central belief that freedom of thought,
   conscience and expression are numinous values, linked to our defining
   characteristics as human beings. While limits must exist, American
   culture and law approach such limits with abiding caution and
   skepticism, embracing freedom of speech as a value of transcendent
   constitutional importance.
