     <p>Governments and societies that bet on the market system become more
     materially prosperous and technologically powerful. The lesson
     usually drawn from this economic success story is that in the
     overwhelming majority of cases the best thing the government can do
     for the economy is to set the background rules - define property
     rights, set up honest courts, perhaps rearrange the distribution of
     income, impose minor taxes and subsidies to compensate for
     well-defined and narrowly-specified "market failures" - but
     otherwise the government should leave the market system alone.

     <p>The main argument for the market system is the dual role played by
     prices. On the one hand, prices serve to ration demand: anyone
     unwilling to pay the market price does not get the good. On the
     other hand, price serves to elicit production: any organization
     that can make a good, or provide a service, for less than its
     market price has a powerful financial incentive to do so. What is
     produced goes to those who value it the most. What is produced is
     made by the organizations that can make it the cheapest. And what
     is produced is whatever the ultimate users value the most.

     <p>The data processing and data communications revolutions shake the
     foundations of the standard case for the market. In a world in
     which a large chunk of the goods valued by users are information
     goods that can be cheaply replicated, it is not socially optimal to
     charge a price to ration demand. In a world in which cheap
     replication produces enormous economies of scale, the producers
     that survive and profit are not those that can produce at the least
     cost or produce the goods that users value the most; instead, the
     producers that flourish are those that established their positions
     first. In a world in which the value chain is only tangentially
     related to ultimate value to users - in which producers earn money
     by selling eyeballs to advertisers, say - there is no certainty
     that what is produced will be what users value the most.

     <p>The market system may well prove to be tougher than its traditional
     defenders have thought, and to have more subtle and powerful
     advantages than those that defenders of the invisible hand have
     usually listed. At the very least, however, defenders will need new
     arguments. And at the most, we will need to develop a new economics
     to discern new answers to the old problem of economic organization.


<h>The Utility of the Market

     <p>Two and one-quarter centuries ago, the Scottish moral philosopher
     Adam Smith used a particular metaphor to describe the competitive
     market system, a metaphor that still resonates today . He saw
     the competitive market as a system in which

     <p>"every individual ... endeavours as much as he can ... to direct
     ... industry so that its produce may be of the greatest value ...
     neither intend[ing] to promote the public interest, nor know[ing]
     how much he is promoting it ... . He intends only his own gain, and
     he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to
     promote an end that was no part of his intention ... . By pursuing
     his own interest he frequently promotes that of society more
     effectually than when he really intends to promote it ..." 

     <p>Adam Smith's claim, made in 1776, that the market system promoted
     the general good was new. Today it is one of the most frequently
     heard commonplaces. For Adam Smith's praise of the market as a
     social mechanism for regulating the economy was the opening shot of
     a grand campaign to reform the way politicians and governments
     looked at the economy.

     <p>The campaign waged by Adam Smith and his successors was completely
     successful. The past two centuries have seen his doctrines woven
     into the fabric of the way our society works. It is hard to even
     begin to think about our society without basing one's thought to
     some degree on Adam Smith's. Today the governments that have
     followed the path Adam Smith laid down preside over economies that
     are more materially prosperous and technologically powerful than
     any we have seen .

     <p>Belief in free trade, an aversion to price controls, freedom of
     occupation, freedom of domicile,  freedom of enterprise and the
     other corollaries of belief in Smith's invisible hand have today
     become the background assumptions for thought about the
     relationship between the government and the economy. A free-market
     system, economists claim and most participants in capitalism
     believe, generates a level of total economic product that is as
     high as possible - and is certainly higher than under any
     alternative system that any branch of humanity has conceived and
     attempted to implement. It is even possible to prove the
     "efficiency" of a competitive market, albeit under restrictive
     technical assumptions .

     <p>The lesson usually drawn from this economic success story is
     laissez-faire, laissez-passer. In the overwhelming majority of
     cases, the best thing the government can do for the economy is
     simply to leave it alone. Define property rights, set up honest
     courts, perhaps rearrange the distribution of income, impose minor
     taxes and subsidies to compensate for well-defined and narrowly
     specified "market failures" but otherwise the economic role of the
     government is to disappear.

     <p>The main argument for a free competitive market system is the dual
     role played by prices. On the one hand, prices serve to ration
     demand. Anyone unwilling to pay the market price because he or she
     would rather do other things with his or her (not unlimited) money
     does not get the good (or service). On the other hand, price serves
     to elicit production. Any organization that can make a good (or
     provide a service) for less than its market price has a powerful
     financial incentive to do so. Thus, what is produced goes to those
     who value it the most. What is produced is made by the
     organizations that can make it most cheaply. And what is produced
     is whatever the ultimate users value the most.

     <p>You can criticize the market system because it undermines the
     values of community and solidarity. You can criticize the market
     system because it is unfair - for it gives good things to those who
     have control over whatever resources turn out to be most scarce as
     society solves its production allocation problem, not to those who
     have any moral right to good things. But - at least under the
     conditions economists have for two and one-quarter centuries first
     implicitly, and more recently explicitly, assumed - you cannot
     criticize the market system for being unproductive.

     <p>Adam Smith's case for the invisible hand, so briefly summarized
     above, will be familiar to almost all readers: It is one of the
     foundation stones of our civilization's social thought. Our purpose
     in this paper is to shake these foundations - or at least to make
     readers aware that the changes in technology now going on as a
     result of the revolutions in data processing and data
     communications may shake these foundations. Unexpressed but
     implicit in Adam Smith's argument for the efficiency of the market
     system are assumptions about the nature of goods and services and
     the process of exchange, assumptions that fit reality less well
     today than they did in Adam Smith's day.

     <p>Moreover, these implicit underlying assumptions are likely to fit
     the "new economy" of the future even less well than they fit the
     economy of today.

  <h>The Structure of This Paper

     <p>The next section of this paper deconstructs Adam Smith's case for
     the market system. It points out three assumptions about production
     and distribution technologies that are necessary if the invisible
     hand is to work as Adam Smith claimed it did. We point out that
     these assumptions are being undermined more and more by the
     revolutions currently ongoing in data processing and data
     communications.

     <p>In the third section, we take a look at things happening on the
     frontiers of electronic commerce and in the developing markets for
     information. Our hope is that what is now going on at the frontiers
     of electronic commerce may contain some clues to processes that
     will be more general in the future.

     <p>Our final section does not answer all the questions we raise. We
     are not prophets, after all. Thus, our final section raises still
     more questions, for the most we can begin to do today is to
     organize our concerns. By looking at the behavior of people in
     high-tech commerce - people for whom the abstract doctrines and
     theories that we present have the concrete reality of determining
     whether they get paid - we can make some guesses about what the
     next economics and the next set of sensible policies might look
     like, if indeed there is going to be a genuinely new economy and,
     thus, a genuinely new economics. We can warn against some pitfalls
     in the hope that our warnings will make things better rather than
     worse.

     

<h>"Technological" Prerequisites of the Market Economy

     <p>The ongoing revolution in data processing and data communications
     technology may well be starting to undermine those basic features
     of property and exchange that make the invisible hand a powerful
     social mechanism for organizing production and distribution. The
     case for the market system has always rested on three implicit
     pillars, three features of the way that property rights and
     exchange worked:

     <p>Call the first feature excludability: the ability of sellers to
     force consumers to become buyers, and thus to pay for whatever
     goods and services they use.

     <p>Call the second feature rivalry: a structure of costs in which two
     cannot partake as cheaply as one, in which producing enough for two
     million people to use will cost at least twice as many of society's
     resources as producing enough for one million people to use.

     <p>Call the third feature transparency: the ability of individuals to
     see clearly what they need and what is for sale, so that they truly
     know just what they wish to buy.

     <p>All three of these pillars fit the economy of Adam Smith's day
     relatively well. The prevalence of craft, as opposed to mass
     production, guaranteed that two goods could be made only at twice
     the cost of one. The fact that most goods and services were valued
     principally for their (scarce) physical form meant that two could
     not use one good: If I am using the plow to plow my field today,
     you cannot use it to plow yours. Thus, rivalry was built into the
     structure of material life that underpinned the economy of
     production and exchange.

     <p>Excludability was less a matter of nature and more a matter of
     culture, but certainly by Smith's day large-scale theft and pillage
     were more the exception than the rule . The courts and the law
     were there to give property owners the power to restrict the set of
     those who could use their property to those who had paid for the
     privilege.

    <p> Last, the slow pace and low level of technology meant that the
     purpose and quality of most goods and services were transparent:
     What you saw was pretty much what you got.

     <p>All three of these pillars fit much of today's economy pretty well
     too, although the fit for the telecommunications and
     information-processing industries is less satisfactory. But they
     will fit tomorrow's economy less well than today's. There is every
     indication that they will fit the 21st-century economy relatively
     poorly .

     <p>As we look at developments along the leading technological edge of
     the economy, we can see considerations that used to be second-order
     "externalities," that served as corrections, growing in strength to
     possibly become first-order phenomena. And we can see the invisible
     hand of the competitive market beginning to work less well in an
     increasing number of areas.

  <h>Excludability

     <p>In the information-based sectors of the next economy, the owners of
     goods and services - call them "commodities" for short - will find
     that they are no longer able to easily and cheaply exclude others
     from using or enjoying the commodities. The carrot-and-stick
     principle that once enabled owners of property to extract value
     from those who wanted to use it was always that if you paid you got
     to make use of it, and if you did not pay you did not get to make
     use of it.

     <p>But digital data is cheap and easy to copy. Methods do exist to
     make copying difficult, time-consuming and dangerous to the freedom
     and wealth of the copier, but these methods add expense and
     complexity. "Key disk" methods of copy protection for programs
     vanished in the late 1980s as it became clear that the burdens they
     imposed on legitimate purchasers and owners were annoying enough to
     cause buyers to "vote with their feet" for competing products.
     Identification-and-password restrictions on access to online
     information are only as powerful as users' concern for information
     providers' intellectual property rights, which is surely not as
     powerful as the information providers' concern.

     <p>In a world of clever hackers, these methods are also unreliable.
     The methods used to protect digital content against casual copying
     seem to have a high rate of failure.

     <p>Without excludability, the relationship between producer and
     consumer becomes much more akin to a gift-exchange relationship
     than a purchase-and-sale one . The appropriate paradigm then
     shifts in the direction of a fundraising drive for a National
     Public Radio station. When commodities are not excludable, people
     simply help themselves. If the user feels like it, he or she may
     make a "pledge" to support the producer. The user sends money to
     the producer not because it is the only way to gain the power to
     use the product, but out of gratitude and for the sake of
     reciprocity.

                               

     <p>This reciprocity-driven revenue stream may well be large enough
     that producers cover their costs and earn a healthy profit.
     Reciprocity is a basic mode of human behavior. Most people do feel
     a moral obligation to tip cabdrivers and waiters. People do
     contribute to National Public Radio (NPR). But without
     excludability, the belief that the market economy produces the
     optimal quantity of any commodity is hard to justify. Other forms
     of provision - public support funded by taxes that are not
     voluntary, for example - that had fatal disadvantages vis-a-vis the
     competitive market when excludability reigned may well deserve
     re-examination .

     <p>We can get a glimpse of the way the absence of excludability can
     warp a market and an industry by taking a brief look at the history
     of network television. During its three-channel apogee in the 1960s
     and 1970s, North American network television was available to
     anyone with an antenna and a receiver. Broadcasters lacked the
     means of preventing the public from getting the signals free of
     charge . Free access was, however, accompanied by scarce
     bandwidth, and by government allocation of the scarce bandwidth to
     producers.

     <p>The absence of excludability for broadcast television did not
     destroy the television broadcasting industry. Broadcasters couldn't
     charge for what they were truly producing, but broadcasters worked
     out that they could charge for something else: the attention of the
     program-watching consumers during commercials. Rather than paying
     money directly, the customers of the broadcast industry merely had
     to endure the commercials (or get up and leave the room, or
     channel-surf) if they wanted to see the show.

     <p>This "attention economy" solution prevented the market for
     broadcast programs from collapsing. It allowed broadcasters to
     charge someone for something, to charge advertisers for eyeballs
     rather than viewers for programs. But it left its imprint on the
     industry. Charging for advertising does not lead to the same
     invisible hand guarantee of productive optimum as does charging for
     product. In the case of network television, audience attention to
     advertisements was more or less unconnected with audience
     involvement in the program.

     <p>This created a bias toward lowest-common-denominator programming.
     Consider two programs, one of which will fascinate 500,000 people,
     and the other of which 30 million people will watch as slightly
     preferable to watching their ceilings. The first might well be
     better for social welfare. The 500,000 with a high willingness to
     pay might well, if there were a way to charge them, collectively
     outbid the 30 million apathetic couch potatoes for the use of
     scarce bandwidth to broadcast their preferred program. Thus, a
     network able to collect revenues from interested viewers would
     broadcast the first program, seeking the applause (and the money)
     of the dedicated and forgoing the eye-glazed semi-attention of the
     larger audience.

     <p>But this competitive process breaks down when the network obtains
     revenue by selling commercials to advertisers. The network can
     offer advertisers either one million or 60 million eyeballs. How
     much the commercials will influence the viewers depends relatively
     little on how much they like the program. As a result, charging for
     advertising gives every incentive to broadcast what a mass audience
     will tolerate. It gives no incentive to broadcast what a niche
     audience would love.

     <p>As bandwidth becomes cheaper, these problems become less important.
     One particular niche program may well be worth broadcasting when
     the mass audience has become sufficiently fragmented by the
     viewability of multiple clones of bland programming. Until now,
     however, expensive bandwidth combined with the absence of
     excludability meant that broadcasting revenues depended on the
     viewer numbers rather than the intensity of demand.
     Non-excludability helped ensure that broadcast programming would be
     "a vast wasteland" .

     <p>In the absence of excludability, industries today and tomorrow are
     likely to fall prey to analogous distortions. Producers' revenue
     streams, wherever they come from, will be only tangentially related
     to the intensity of user demand. Thus, the flow of money through
     the market will not serve its primary purpose of registering the
     utility of the commodity being produced. There is no reason to
     think ex ante that the commodities that generate the most
     attractive revenue streams paid by advertisers or by ancillary
     others will be the commodities that ultimate consumers would wish
     to see produced.

  <h>Rivalry

     <p>In the information-based sectors of the next economy, the use or
     enjoyment of an information-based commodity will no longer
     necessarily involve rivalry. With most tangible goods, if Alice is
     using a particular good, Bob cannot be. Charging the ultimate
     consumer the good's cost of production or the free-market price
     provides the producer with an ample reward for its effort. It also
     leads to the appropriate level of production. Social surplus
     (measured in money) is not maximized by providing the good to
     anyone whose final demand for a commodity is too weak for that
     person to wish to pay the cost for it that a competitive market
     would require.

     <p>But if goods are non-rival - if two can consume as cheaply as one -
     then charging a per-unit price to users artificially restricts
     distribution. To truly maximize social welfare, we need a system
     that supplies everyone whose willingness to pay for the good is
     greater than the marginal cost of producing another copy. If the
     marginal cost of reproduction of a digital good is near zero, that
     means almost everyone should have it for almost no charge. However,
     charging a price equal to marginal cost almost surely leaves the
     producer bankrupt, with little incentive to maintain the product
     except for the hope of maintenance fees. There is no incentive to
     make another one except that warm, fuzzy feeling one gets from
     impoverishing oneself for the general good.

                               

     <p>Thus we have a dilemma. If the price of a digital good is above the
     marginal cost of making an extra copy, some people who truly ought
     (in the best of all possible worlds) to be using it do not get to
     have it. The system of exchange that we have developed is getting
     in the way of a certain degree of economic prosperity. But if price
     is not above the marginal cost of making an extra copy of a
     non-rival good, the producer will not be paid enough to cover
     costs. Without non-financial incentives, all but the most
     masochistic producer will get out the business of production.

     <p>More important, perhaps, is that the existence of large numbers of
     important and valuable goods that are non-rival casts doubt upon
     the value of competition itself. Competition has been the standard
     way of keeping individual producers from exercising power over
     consumers. If you don't like the terms the producer is offering,
     you can just go down the street. But this use of private economic
     power to check private power may come at a high cost if competitors
     spend their time duplicating each other's efforts and attempting to
     slow down technological development in the interest of obtaining a
     compatibility advantage, or creating a compatibility or usability
     disadvantage for the other competitor.

     <p>One traditional answer to this problem (now in total disfavor) was
     to set up a government regulatory commission to control the
     "natural monopoly." The commission would set prices and would do
     the best it could to simulate a socially optimum level of
     production. On the eve of World War I, when American Telephone and
     Telegraph (AT&T), under the leadership of its visionary CEO,
     Theodore N. Vail, began its drive for universal coverage, a
     political consensus formed rapidly both in Washington and within
     AT&T that the right structural form for the telephone industry was
     a privately owned, publicly regulated national monopoly.

     <p>While it may have seemed like the perfect answer in the Progressive
     era, in this more cynical age commentators have come to believe
     that regulatory commissions of this sort almost inevitably become
     "captured" by the industries they are meant to regulate . Often
     this occurs because the natural career path for analysts and
     commissioners involves some day going to work in the regulated
     industry in order to leverage expertise in the regulatory process.
     Sometimes it is because no one outside the regulated industry has
     anywhere near the same financial interest in manipulating the
     rules, or lobbying to have them adjusted. The only effective way a
     regulatory agency has to gauge what is possible is to examine how
     other firms in other regions are doing. But such "yardstick"
     competition proposals - judging how this natural monopoly is doing
     by comparing it to other analogous organizations - are notoriously
     hard to implement .

     <p>A good economic market is characterized by competition to limit the
     exercise of private economic power, by price equal to marginal
     cost, by returns to investors and workers corresponding to the
     social value added of the industry, and by appropriate incentives
     for innovation and new product development. These seem impossible
     to achieve all at once in markets for non-rival goods - and digital
     goods are certainly non-rival.

  <h>Transparency

     <p>In many information-based sectors of the next economy, the purchase
     of a good will no longer be transparent. The invisible hand theory
     assumes that purchasers know what they want and what they are
     buying so that they can effectively take advantage of competition
     and comparison-shop. If purchasers need first to figure out what
     they want and what they are buying, there is no good reason to
     assume that their willingness to pay corresponds to its true value
     to them.

     <p>Why is transparency at risk? Because much of the value added in the
     data-processing and data-communications industries today comes from
     complicated and evolving systems of information provision. Adam
     Smith's pinmakers sold a good that was small, fungible,
     low-maintenance and easily understood. Alice could buy her pins
     from Gerald today and from Henry tomorrow. But today's purchaser
     of, say, a cable modem connection to the Internet from
     AT&T-Excite-@Home is purchasing a bundle of present goods and
     future services, and is making a down payment on the establishment
     of a long-term relationship with AT&T-Excite-@Home. Once the
     relationship is established, both buyer and seller find themselves
     in different positions. Adam Smith's images are less persuasive in
     the context of services - especially services that require deep
     knowledge of the customer's wants and situation (and of the maker's
     capabilities) - that are not, by their nature, fungible or easily
     comparable.

     <p>When Alice shops for a software suite, not only does she want to
     know about its current functionality - something notoriously
     difficult to figure out until one has had days or weeks of hands-on
     experience - but she also needs to have some idea of the likely
     support that the manufacturer will provide. Is it a toll call? Is
     the line busy at all hours? Do the operators have a clue? Will next
     year's corporate downsizing lead to longer holds on support calls?

     <p>Worse, what Alice really needs to know cannot be measured at all
     before she is committed. Learning how to use a software package is
     an investment she would prefer not to repeat. Since operating
     systems are upgraded frequently, and interoperability needs change
     even more often, Alice needs to have a prediction about the likely
     upgrade path for her suite. This, however, turns on unknowable and
     barely guessable factors: the health of the corporation, the
     creativity of the software team, the corporate relationships
     between the suite seller and other companies.

     <p>Some of the things Alice wants to know, such as whether the suite
     works and works quickly enough on her computer, are potentially
     measurable, at least, although one rarely finds a consumer capable
     of measuring them before purchase, or a marketing system designed
     to accommodate such a need. You buy the shrink-wrapped box at a
     store, take it home, unwrap the box - and find that the program is
     incompatible with your hardware, your operating system, or one of
     the six programs you bought to cure defects in the hardware or the
     operating system.

     <p>Worse still, the producer of a software product has every incentive
     to attempt to "lock in" as many customers as possible. Operating
     system revisions that break old software versions require upgrades.
     A producer has an attractive and inelastic revenue source to the
     extent that "lock-in" makes switching to an alternative painful.
     While consumers prefer the ability to comparison-shop and to switch
     easily to another product, producers fear this ability - and have
     incentives to subtly tweak their programs to make it difficult to
     do so .

  <h>The Economics of Market Failure

     <p>That the absence of excludability, rivalry or transparency is bad
     for the functioning invisible hand is not news . The analysis
     of transparency failure has made up an entire subfield of economics
     for decades: "imperfect information." Non-rivalry has been the
     basis of the theory of government programs and public goods, as
     well as of natural monopolies. The solution has been to try to find
     a regulatory regime that will mimic the decisions that the
     competitive market ought to make, or to accept that the "second
     best" public provision of the good by the government is the best
     that can be done.

     <p>Analysis of the impact of the lack of excludability is the core of
     the economic analysis of research and development. It has led to
     the conclusion that the best course is to try to work around
     non-excludability by mimicking what a well-functioning market
     system would have done. Use the law to expand "property," or use
     tax-and-subsidy schemes to promote actions with broad benefits.

     <p>But the focus of analysis has traditionally been on overcoming
     "frictions". How can we transform this situation in which the
     requirements of laissez-faire fail to hold into a situation in
     which the invisible hand works tolerably well? As long as it works
     well throughout most of the economy, this is a very sensible
     analytical and policy strategy. A limited number of government
     programs and legal doctrines will be needed to closely mimic what
     the invisible hand would do if it could function properly in a few
     distinct areas of the economy (such as the regional natural
     monopolies implicit in the turn-of-the-twentieth-century railroad,
     or government subsidies granted to basic research).

     

<h>Out on the Cybernetic Frontier

     <p>But what happens when the friction becomes the machine?

     <p>What will happen in the future if problems of non-excludability, of
     non-rivalry, of non-transparency come to apply to a large range of
     the economy? What happens if they come to occupy as central a place
     in business decision making as inventory control or production
     operations management does today? In the natural sciences,
     perturbation-theory approaches breakdown when the deviations of
     initial conditions from those necessary for the simple solution
     become large. Does something similar happen in political economy?
     Is examining the way the market system handles a few small episodes
     of "market failure" a good guide for understanding the way it will
     handle many large ones?

     <p>We do not know. But we do want to take a first step toward
     discerning what new theories of the new markets might look like if
     new visions turn out to be necessary (or if old visions need to be
     adjusted). It is natural to examine the way enterprises and
     entrepreneurs are reacting today to the coming of
     non-excludability, non-rivalry and non-transparency on the
     electronic frontier. The hope is that experience along the
     frontiers of electronic commerce will serve as a good guide to what
     pieces of the theory are likely to be most important, and will
     suggest areas in which further development might have a high rate
     of return.

  <h>The Market for Software: Shareware, Public Betas and More

     <p>We have noted that the market for modern, complex products is
     anything but transparent. While one can think of services, such as
     medicine, that are particularly opaque to the buyer, today it is
     difficult to imagine a more opaque product than software. Indeed,
     when one considers the increasing opacity of products in the
     context of the growing importance of services to the economy, it
     suggests that transparency will become a particularly important
     issue in the next economy.

     <p>Consumers' failure to acquire full information about the software
     they buy certainly demonstrates that acquiring the information must
     be expensive. In response to this cost, social institutions have
     begun to spring up to get around the shrink-wrap dilemma. The first
     was known as shareware. You download the program; if you like the
     program you send its author some money, and perhaps in return you
     get a manual, access to support and/or an upgraded version.

     <p>The benefit of try-before-you-buy is precisely that it makes the
     process more transparent. The cost is that try-before-you-buy often
     turns out to be try-use-and-don't-pay.

     <p>The next stage beyond shareware has been the evolution of the
     institution of the public beta. This is a time-limited (or
     bug-ridden, or otherwise restricted) version of the product. Users
     can investigate the properties of the public beta version to figure
     out whether the product is worthwhile. But to get the permanent (or
     the less bug-ridden) version, they have to pay.

     <p>Yet a third stage is the "dual track" version: Eudora shareware
     versus Eudora Pro, for example. Perhaps the hope is that users of
     the free low-power version will some day become richer, or less
     patient or find they have greater needs. At that point, they will
     find it least disruptive to switch to a product that looks and
     feels familiar, that is compatible with their habits and with their
     existing files. In effect (and if the sellers are lucky), the free
     version captures users as future customers before they are even
     aware they are future buyers.

     <p>The developing free-public-beta industry is a way of dealing with
     the problem of lack of transparency. It is a relatively benign
     development, in the sense that it involves competition through
     distribution of lesser versions of the ultimate product. An
     alternative would be (say) the strategy of constructing barriers to
     compatibility. The famous examples in the computer industry come
     from the 1970s, when Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) made
     nonstandard cable connectors; from the mid-1980s, when IBM
     attempted to appropriate the entire PC industry through its PS/2
     line; and from the late 1980s, when Apple Computer used a partly
     ROM-based operating system to exclude clones.

     <p>Fortunately for consumers, these alternative strategies proved (in
     the latter two cases, at least) to be catastrophic failures for the
     companies pursuing them. Perhaps the main reason that the
     free-public-beta strategy is now dominant is this catastrophic
     failure of strategies of incompatibility - even though they did
     come close to success.

     <p>A fourth, increasingly important, solution to the transparency
     problem is open-source software . Open source solves the
     software opacity problem with total transparency; the source code
     itself is available to all for examination and re-use. Open source
     programs can be sold, but whenever the right to use a program is
     conferred, it brings with it additional rights, to inspect and
     alter the software, and to convey the altered program to others.

     <p>In the case of the "Copyleft license," for example, anyone may
     modify and re-use the code, provided that they comply with the
     conditions in the original license and impose similar conditions of
     openness and re-usability on all subsequent users of the code .
     License terms do vary. This variation itself is a source of
     potential opacity . However, it is easy to envision a world in
     which open-source software plays an increasingly large role.

     <p>Open source's vulnerability (and perhaps also its strength) is that
     it is, by design, only minimally excludable. Without excludability,
     it is harder to get paid for your work. Traditional economic
     thinking suggests that all other things being equal, people will
     tend to concentrate their efforts on things that get them paid. And
     when, as in software markets, the chance to produce a product that
     dominates a single category holds out the prospect of enormous
     payment (think Windows), one might expect that effort to be greater
     still.

     <p>Essentially volunteer software development would seem particularly
     vulnerable to the tragedy of the commons. Open source has, however,
     evolved a number of strategies that at least ameliorate, and may
     even overcome, this problem. Open-source authors gain status by
     writing code. Not only do they receive kudos, but the work can be
     used as a way to gain marketable reputation. Writing open-source
     code that becomes widely used and accepted serves as a virtual
     business card, and helps overcome the lack of transparency in the
     market for high-level software engineers.

     <p>The absence of the prospect of an enormous payout may retard the
     development of new features in large, collaborative open-source
     projects. It may also reduce the richness of the feature set.
     However, since most people apparently use a fairly small subset of
     the features provided by major packages, this may not be a major
     problem. Furthermore, open source may make proprietary designer
     add-ons both technically feasible and economically rational.

     <p>In open source, the revenues cannot come from traditional
     intellectual property rights alone. One must provide some sort of
     other value - be it a help desk, easy installation, or extra
     features - in order to be paid. Moreover, there remains the danger
     that one may not be paid at all.

     <p>Nevertheless, open source has already proven itself to be viable in
     important markets. The World Wide Web as we know it exists because
     Tim Berners-Lee open-sourced HTML and HTTP.

  <h>Of Shop-bots, Online Auctions and Meta-Sites

     <p>Predictions abound as to how software will use case- and rule-based
     thinking to do your shopping for you, advise you on how to spend
     your leisure time and in general organize your life for you. But
     that day is still far in the future. So far, we have only the early
     generations of the knowledge-scavenging virtual robot and the
     automated comparison shopper. Already, however, we can discern some
     trends, and identify places where legal rules are likely to shape
     microeconomic outcomes. The interaction between the law and the
     market has, as one would expect, distributional consequences. More
     surprisingly, perhaps, it also has potential implications for
     economic efficiency.

     <h>Shop-bots

     <p>Bargain Finder was one of the first Internet-based shopping agents
     . In its first incarnation, in 1997, it did just one thing;
     even then it did it too well for some. Now that Bargain Finder and
     other intelligent shopping agents have spread into a wide range of
     markets, a virtual war over access to and control of price
     information is raging in the online marketplace. Thus, one has to
     ask: Does the price come at a price?

     <p>In the initial version of Bargain Finder, and to this day, the user
     enters the details of a music compact disk she might like to
     purchase. Bargain Finder interrogates several online music stores
     that might offer to sell it. It then reports back the prices in a
     tidy table that makes comparison shopping easy. Initially, the
     system was not completely transparent. It was not always possible
     to discern the vendor's shipping charges without visiting the
     vendor's Web site. But as Bargain Finder's inventors said, it was
     "only an experiment."

     <p>Today, it's no longer an experiment. "Shipping and handling" is
     included as a separate and visible charge. The output is a handsome
     table that can be sorted by price, by speed of delivery or by
     merchant. It can be further customized to take account of shipping
     costs by zip code, and results can be sorted by price or by speed
     of delivery. While the user sees the names of the firms whose
     prices are listed, it's a short list, and there is no way to know
     what other firms may have been queried.

     <p>Other, newer, shopping agents take a more aggressive approach.
     R-U-Sure installs an application on the desktop that monitors the
     user's Web browsing. Whenever the user interacts with an e-commerce
     site that R-U-Sure recognizes, it swings into action, and a little
     box pops up with a whooshing noise. It display the queries it is
     sending to competing merchants' Web stores to see if they have a
     better price, and reports on the winner.

     <p>Competitor clickthebutton installs an icon in the task bar, but
     pops up only when it is clicked. The company provides a full and
     impressively lengthy list of sites it is capable of querying on the
     shopper's behalf .

     <h>Bidding Services

     <p>Price competition is also fostered by bidding services and
     auctions. Bidding services such as Priceline.com (hotels, air
     tickets) and NexTag.com (consumer goods and electronics) invite
     customers to send a price they would be willing to pay for a
     commodity service or good. However, price competition is
     constrained. There is no obvious way for consumers to learn what
     deals others have been able to secure, and the bidding services
     appear designed to discourage experimentation aimed at finding out
     the market-clearing price.

     <p>Priceline.com requires the consumer to commit to pay if his offer
     is accepted. NexTag.com does not, but tracks the user's behavior
     with a "reputation" number that goes up when a merchant's
     acceptance of a bid results in a purchase and goes down when an
     accepted bid does not lead to a purchase. Unlike Priceline.com,
     however, NexTag.com contemplates multi-round negotiations.
     "Sellers," it warns, "will be more likely to respond to your
     requests if you have a high rating."

     <p>At first glance, a highly variegated good such as a college
     education would seem to resist any effort at a bidding process.
     Nevertheless, eCollegebid has a Web site that invites prospective
     college students to state what they are willing to pay and then
     offers to match it with a "college's willingness to offer tuition
     discounts." Although the list of participating colleges is not
     published, or even shared with competing colleges, executive
     director Tedd Kelly states that six colleges are set to participate
     and negotiations are under way with more than fifteen others. In
     its first five weeks, 508 students placed bids . Once a college
     meets a price, the student is asked, but not required, to reply
     within 30 days, and to submit an application that the college
     retains the option of rejecting.

     <h>Auction Sites

     <p>Auction sites provide a different type of price competition, and a
     different interface with shopping bots. Users can either place each
     of their bids manually, or they can set up a bidding bot to place
     their bids for them. eBay, for example, encourages bidders not only
     to place an initial bid but also to set up "proxy bidding" in which
     any competing bid immediately will be met with a response, up to
     the user's maximum price. Since eBay gets a commission based in
     part on the final sale price, it gains whenever proxy bidding
     pushes up the price.

     <p>Perhaps the fastest growing segment of the online auction market is
     aimed at business-to-business transactions. An example is
     FreeMarkets, which boasts, "We created online auctions covering
     approximately $1 billion in 1998, and estimate we saved clients
     225%. Since 1995, we have created online auctions for more than 30
     buyers in over 50 product categories. More than 1,800 suppliers
     from more than 30 countries have participated in our auctions."

     <h>Meta Auction Sites

     <p>There are a significant number of competing consumer auction sites
     in operation. The profusion of auctions has created a demand for
     meta-sites that provide information about the goods offered on
     multiple online auctions. Examples of meta-sites include
     AuctionWatch.com and Auction Watchers.

     <p>AuctionWatch.com, like Bargain Finder, has become too successful
     for some. eBay initially requested that meta-sites not list its
     auctions. When AuctionWatch.com failed to comply, eBay threatened
     AuctionWatch.com with legal action, claiming that AuctionWatch's
     "Universal Search" function, which directs users to auctions on
     eBay and competing services (Yahoo, Amazon.com, MSN, BidStream.com,
     and Ruby Lane) is an "unauthorized intrusion" that places an
     unnecessary load on eBay's servers, violates eBay's intellectual
     property rights, and misleads users by not returning the full
     results of some searches .

     <p>The claim that eBay's auction prices or the details of the sellers'
     offers to sell are protected in the U.S. by copyright, trade secret
     or other intellectual property law is bogus. (However, there are
     proposals in Congress to change the law in a way that may make the
     claim more plausible in the future.) Other hitherto untested legal
     theories may, however, prove more plausible. A claim that
     meta-sites were somehow damaging eBay by overloading its servers,
     or a claim based on some kind of trespass, might find more support.

     <p>Whether meta auction sites burden certain targeted servers is
     itself a difficult factual issue. To the extent that many who are
     not interested in bidding see the data on the meta-site, the load
     on eBay is reduced. The current law is probably in the meta-sites'
     favor. But there is uncertainty, and this uncertainty is compounded
     by the possibility of legislation.

     <h>Efficiency?

     <p>It is particularly appropriate to ask what the economically
     efficient solution might be at a time when the law is somewhat in
     flux. Most economists, be they Adam Smithian classicists,
     neoclassical Austrians, or more modern economics-of-information
     mavens, would at first thought instinctively agree with the
     proposition that a vendor in a competitive market selling a
     standardized product - for one Tiger Lily CD is as good as another
     - would want customers to know as much as possible about what the
     vendor offers for sale, and the prices at which the goods are
     available.

     <p>The reason for this near-consensus is that in a competitive market
     every sale at the offer price should be welcome; all are made at a
     markup over marginal cost. Thus, all online CD retailers ought to
     have wanted to be listed by Bargain Finder, if only because every
     sale that went elsewhere when they had the lowest price was lost
     profit.

     <p>But not so.

     <p>A significant fraction of the merchants regularly visited by
     Bargain Finder were less than ecstatic. They retaliated by blocking
     the agent's access to their otherwise publicly available data. As
     of March 1997, one third of the merchants targeted by Bargain
     Finder locked out its queries. One, CDNOW, did so for frankly
     competitive reasons. The other two said that the costs of large
     numbers of "hobbyist" queries were too great for them. A similar
     dynamic is currently unfolding in the online auction world: eBay,
     the best-known online auction site, has started to block
     AuctionWatch's access to eBay's data.

     <p>One possible explanation for the divergence between the economic
     theorist's prediction that every seller should want to be listed by
     Bargain Finder or AuctionWatch and the apparent outcome is the
     price-gouging story. In this scenario, stores blocking comparison
     sites tend to charge higher-than-normal prices because they are
     able to take advantage of consumer ignorance of cheaper
     alternatives. The stores are gouging buyers by taking advantage of
     relatively high search costs.

     <p>Our utterly unscientific Web browsing supports the hypothesis that
     consumers have yet to figure out how to bring their search costs
     down - R-U-Sure may need a lot more publicity. Prices are in flux
     and do not appear to be behaving the way Adam Smith would predict.
     Random browsing among various delivery channels reveals wide price
     fluctuations, peaking at 40% on one occasion for consumer
     electronics items under $200. In this case, Bargain Finder and its
     successors would indeed be valuable developments. They will make
     markets more efficient and will lower prices.

     <p>Another possibility is the "kindly service" story. Perhaps stores
     blocking Bargain Finder, R-U-Sure or meta-sites tend to charge
     higher-than-normal prices because they provide additional service
     or convenience. If commerce becomes increasingly electronic and
     impersonal (or if "personal" comes to mean "filtered through
     fiendishly clever software agents"), this sort of humanized
     attention will become increasingly expensive. To the extent that
     this additional service or convenience can be provided
     automatically, things are less clear.

     <p>In a sometimes forgotten classic, The Joyless Economy, Tibor
     Scitovsky noted that the advent of mass production of furniture
     seemed to cause the price of hand-carved chairs to increase, even
     as the demand for them shrank . As consumers switched to less
     costly (and less carefully made, one-size-fits-all) mass-produced
     furniture, carvers became scarce and business for the remaining
     carvers became scarcer. Soon only the rich could engage their
     services.

     <p>If the "kindly service" story is right, the rise of the commodity
     market creates a risk of a possible decline in service-intensive or
     higher-quality goods. Mass tastes will be satisfied more cheaply,
     yet specialty tastes will become more of an expensive luxury. On
     the other hand, the rise of shop-bots such as Bargain Finder or
     R-U-Sure offers an opportunity for consumers to aggregate their
     preferences on a worldwide scale. Indeed, Mercata provides a
     service by which consumers can group together to put in a group buy
     for a product. The larger the number of units, the lower the price,
     although it is not clear that even the resulting price is always
     lower than what might be found by determined Web browsing. Thus,
     the transaction costs associated with aggregation of identical but
     disparate preferences, and with the communication and satisfaction
     of individualized preferences, should be going down. As it becomes
     increasingly easy for consumers to communicate their individualized
     preferences to manufacturers and suppliers, and increasingly easy
     to tailor goods to individual tastes - be it a CD that has only the
     tracks you like, customized blue jeans, or a car manufactured (just
     in time) to your specifications - personalized goods may become the
     norm, putting the "joy" back into the economy and replacing the era
     of mass production with an era of mass customization.

                               

     <p>Some signs of this were visible even before the information
     revolution. Lower costs of customization have already undermined
     one of Scitovsky's examples as fresh-baked bread makes its comeback
     at many supermarkets and specialty stores. Alfred P. Sloan created
     General Motors and the automobile industry of the post-World War II
     era by piling different body styles, colors and option packages on
     top of the same Chevy drive train.

     <p>In either the "price gouging" or the "kindly service" story, the
     advent of services such as Bargain Finder and R-U-Sure presents
     retailers of many goods with a dilemma. If they join in, they
     contribute toward turning the market for CDs, books, consumer
     electronics and other, similar goods into a commodity market with
     competition only on price. If they act "selflessly" and stay out,
     in order to try to degrade the utility of shop-bots and meta-sites
     (and preserve their higher average markup), they must hope that
     their competitors will understand their long-run self-interest in
     the same way.

     <p>But overt communication in which all sellers agreed to block
     Bargain Finder would, of course, violate the Sherman Act. And
     without a means of retaliation to "punish" players that do not
     pursue the collusive long-run strategy of blocking Bargain Finder,
     the collapse of the market into a commodity market with only price
     competition, and with little provided in the way of ancillary
     shopping services, appears likely.

     <p>When we wrote the first draft of this paper, we noted that if CD
     retailers were trying to undermine Bargain Finder by staying away,
     their strategy appeared to be failing. Some CD retailers that
     initially blocked Bargain Finder later unblocked it, while others
     were clamoring to join. Since then, the rise of a new generation of
     meta-sites and alternate means of creating price competition makes
     the question somewhat moot. The technological arms race, pitting
     meta-sites and shop-bots against merchants, will continue, but the
     attackers seem to have the advantage, if only because of their
     numbers.

     <p>Whether or not this is an occasion for joy depends on which of our
     explanations above is closer to the truth. The growth of the
     bookstore chain put the local bookshop out of business, just as the
     growth of supermarkets killed the corner grocer. Not everyone
     considers this trend to be a victory, despite the lower prices. A
     human element has been lost, and a "personal service" element that
     may have led to a better fit between purchaser and purchase has
     been lost as well.

     <p>So far, the discussion has operated on the basis of the assumption
     that merchants have an incentive to block comparison shopping
     services if they charge higher-than-normal prices. Strangely, some
     merchants may have an incentive to block it if they charge
     lower-than-normal prices. As we all know, merchants sometimes
     advertise a "loss leader," and offer to sell a particular good at
     an unprofitable price. Merchants do this in order to lure consumers
     into the store, either to try to sell them more profitable versions
     of the same good (leading, in the extreme case, to
     "bait-and-switch"), or in the hope that the consumer will spy
     other, more profitable, goods to round out the market basket.

     <p>You can explain this merchant behavior in different ways, by
     talking about the economics of information, locational utility,
     myopic consumers generalizing incorrectly on the basis of a small
     number of real bargains or temporary monopolies caused by the
     consumer's presence in this store as opposed to another store far
     away.

     <p>It may be that merchants blocking Bargain Finder did not want
     consumers to be able to exploit their "loss leaders" without having
     to be exposed to the other goods offered simultaneously. Without
     this exposure, the "loss leaders" would not lure buyers to other,
     higher-profit, items, but would simply be losses. The merchant's
     ability to monopolize the consumer's attention for a period may be
     the essence of modern retailing; the reaction to Bargain Finder and
     AuctionWatch, at least, suggests that this is what merchants
     believe.

     <p>The growing popularity of frequent-buyer and other loyalty programs
     also suggests that getting and keeping customer attention is
     important to sellers. Interestingly, this explanation works about
     equally well for the "kindly service" and "loss leader"
     explanations - the two stories that are consistent with the
     assumption that the CD market was relatively efficient before
     Bargain Finder came along.

  <h>Browsing Is Our Business

     <p>More important, and perhaps more likely, is the possibility that
     Bargain Finder and other shop-bots threaten merchants that are in
     the "browsing assistance" business. Some online merchants are
     enthusiastically attempting to fill the role of personal shopping
     assistant. Indeed, some of the most successful online stores have
     adapted to the new marketplace by inverting the information
     equation.

     <p>Retail stores in meatspace ("meatspace" being the part of life that
     is not cyberspace) provide information about available products -
     browsing and information acquisition services - that consumers find
     valuable and are willing to pay for, either in time and attention
     or in cash. Certainly meatspace shopping encourages unplanned
     (impulse) purchases, as any refrigerator groaning under the weight
     of kitchen magnets shows. Retail stores in cyberspace may
     exacerbate this tendency. What, after all, is a store in cyberspace
     but a collection of information?

                               

     <p>CDNOW, for example, tailors its virtual storefront to what it knows
     of a customer's tastes based on her past purchases. In addition to
     dynamically altering the storefront on each visit, CDNOW also
     offers to send shoppers occasional e-mail information about new
     releases that fit their past buying patterns.

     <p>One can imagine stores tailoring what they present to what they
     presume to be the customer's desires, based on demographic
     information that was available about the customer even before the
     first purchase. Tailoring might extend beyond showcasing different
     wares. Taken to the logical extreme, it would include some form of
     price discrimination based on facts known about the customer's
     preferences, or on demographic information thought to be correlated
     with preferences. (The U.S. and other legal systems impose
     constraints on the extent to which stores may generalize from
     demographic information. For example, stores that attempt
     race-based, sex-based, or other types of invidious price variation
     usually violate U.S. law.)

     <p>A critical microeconomic question in all this is how consumers and
     manufacturer/sellers exchange information in this market. Both
     consumers and sellers have an interest in encouraging the exchange
     of information. In order to provide what the consumer wants, the
     sellers need to know what is desired and how badly it is wanted.
     Consumers need to know what is offered where, and at what price. A
     shop-bot may solve the consumer's problem of price, but it will not
     tell him about an existing product of which he is unaware.
     Similarly, CDNOW may reconfigure its store to fit customer
     profiles, but without some external source of information about
     customers, this takes time and requires repeat visitors. Indeed, it
     requires that customers come in through the front door. All the
     reconfiguration in the world will not help CDNOW or eBay if
     customers are unaware that they would enjoy its products, or if the
     customers' only relationship with CDNOW is via a shop-bot or a
     meta-site.

     <p>The retail outlet in the average mall can plausibly be described as
     a mechanism for informing consumers about product attributes. The
     merchant gives away product information in the hope that consumers
     will make purchases. Physical stores, however, have fixed displays
     and thus must provide more or less identical information to every
     customer. Anyone who looks in the window, anyone who studies the
     product labels, or even the product catalogs, receives the same
     sales pitch.

     <p>Recent reports on the microeconomics of virtual retailing suggests
     that what is really happening is a war for the customer's attention
     - a war for eyeballs . Certainly the rush to create "portals"
     that, providers hope, will become the surfer-shopper's default home
     page on the Internet suggests that some large investors believe
     eyeballs are well worth having. So too does the tendency of
     successful early entrants in one product market to seek to leverage
     their brand into other markets.

     <p>It may be that the "dynamic storefront" story is the Internet's
     substitute for the "kindly service" story. If so, the rise of
     agent-based shopping may well be surprisingly destructive. It
     raises the possibility of a world in which retail shops providing
     valuable services are destroyed by an economic process that funnels
     a large percentage of consumer sales into what become commodity
     markets without middlemen. People use the high-priced premium
     cyberstore to browse, but then use Bargain Finder to purchase.

                               

     <p>To appreciate the problem, consider Bob, an online merchant who has
     invested a substantial amount in a large and easy-to-use "browsing"
     database that combines your past purchases, current news, new
     releases and other information to present you with a series of
     choices and possible purchases that greatly increase your chances
     of coming across something interesting. After all, a customer
     enters seeking not a particular title, and not a random title, but
     a product that he or she would like. What is being sold is the
     process of search and information acquisition that leads to the
     judgment that this is something to buy. A good online merchant
     would make the service of "browsing" easy - and would in large part
     be selling that browsing assistance.

     <p>If this browsing is our business story, there is a potential
     problem. Browsing assistance is not an excludable commodity. Unless
     Bob charges for his services (which is likely to discourage most
     customers, and especially the impulse purchaser), there is nothing
     to stop Alice from browsing merchant Bob's Web site to determining
     the product she wants, and then using Bargain Finder to find the
     cheapest source of supply. Bargain Finder will surely find a
     competitor with lower prices, because Bob's competitor will not
     have to pay for the database and the software underlying the
     browsing assistance.

     <p>If so, projects such as Bargain Finder will have a potentially
     destructive application, for many online stores will be easy to
     turn into commodity markets once the process of information
     acquisition and browsing is complete. It would be straightforward
     to run a market in kitchen gadgets along the lines of Bargain
     Finder, even if much of the market for gadgets involves finding
     solutions to problems one was not consciously aware one had. First
     take a free ride on one of the sites that provide browsing
     assistance to discover what you want, then open another window and
     access Bargain Finder to buy it.

     <p>Students and others with more time than money have been using this
     strategy to purchase stereo components for decades. Draw on the
     sales expertise offered at the premium store, then buy from the
     warehouse. But the scope and ease of this strategy is about to
     become much greater.

     <p>To merchants providing helpful shopping advice, the end result will
     be as if they spent all their time in their competitors' discount
     warehouse, pointing out goods that the competitors' customers ought
     to buy. The only people who will pay premium prices for the
     physical good - and thus pay for browsing and information services
     - will be those who feel under a gift-exchange moral obligation to
     do so: the "sponsors" of NPR. Thus, cyberstores that offer browsing
     assistance may find that they have many interests in common with
     the physical stores in the mall - which fear that consumers will
     browse in their stores, and then go home and buy products tax-free
     on the Internet.

  <h>Collaborative Filtering

     <p>Collaborative filtering provides part of the answer to the
     information exchange problem. It also provides another example of
     how information technology changes the way that consumer markets
     will operate. In their simplest form, collaborative filters bring
     together consumers to exchange information about their preferences.
     The assumption is that if Alice finds that several other readers -
     each of whom, like her, likes Frisch, Kafka, Kundera and Klima but
     gets impatient with James and Joyce - tend to like William Gass,
     the odds are good that Alice will enjoy Gass's On Being Blue as
     well.

     <p>In the process of entering sufficient information about her tastes
     to prime the pump, Alice adds to the database of linked preference
     information. In helping herself, Alice helps others. In this
     simplest form, the collaborative filter helps Alice find out about
     new books she might like. The technology is applicable to finding
     potentially desirable CDs, news, Web sites, software, travel,
     financial services and restaurants, as well as to helping Alice
     find people who share her interests.

     <p>At the next level of complexity, the collaborative filter can be
     linked to a shop-bot. Once Alice has decided that she will try On
     Being Blue, she can find out who will sell it to her at the best
     price.

     <p>The truly interesting development, however, comes when Alice's
     personal preference data are available to every merchant Alice
     visits. (Leave aside for a moment who owns these data, and the
     terms on which they become available.) A shop such as CDNOW becomes
     able to tailor its virtual storefront to a fairly good model of
     Alice's likely desires upon her first visit. CDNOW may use this
     information to showcase its most enticing wares, or it may use it
     to fine-tune its prices to charge Alice all that she can afford -
     or both.

     <p>Whichever is the case, shopping will not be the same.

     <p>Once shops acquire the ability to engage in price discrimination,
     consumers will of course seek ways of fighting back. One way will
     be to shop anonymously, and see what price is quoted when no
     consumer data are proffered. Consumers can either attempt to
     prevent merchants and others from acquiring the transactional data
     that could form the basis of a consumer profile, or they can avail
     themselves of anonymizing intermediaries that will protect the
     consumer against the merchant's attempt to practice perfect price
     discrimination by aggregating data about the seller's prices and
     practices. In this model, a significant fraction of cyber commerce
     will be conducted by software agents that will carry accreditation
     demonstrating their credit worthiness, but will not be traceable
     back to those who use them.

     <p>Thus, potential legal constraints on online anonymity may have more
     far-reaching consequences than their obvious effect on
     unconstrained political speech . In some cases, consumers may
     be able to use collaborative filtering techniques to form buying
     clubs and achieve quantity discounts, as in the case of Mercata
     . Or consumers will construct shopping personas with false
     demographics and purchase patterns in the hope of getting access to
     discounts. Business fliers across America routinely purchase
     back-to-back round-trip tickets that bracket a Saturday night in an
     attempt to diminish the airlines' ability to charge business
     travelers premium prices. Airlines, meanwhile, have invested in
     computer techniques to catch and invalidate the second ticket.

     <p>Consumers will face difficult maximization problems. In the absence
     of price discrimination, and assuming privacy itself is only an
     intermediate good (i.e., that consumers do not value privacy in and
     of itself), the marginal value to the consumer of a given datum
     concerning her behavior is likely to be less than the average value
     to the merchant of each datum in an aggregated consumer profile. If
     markets are efficient, or if consumers suffer from a plausible
     myopia in which they value data at the short-run marginal value
     rather than the long-term average cost, merchants will purchase
     this information, leading to a world with little transactional
     privacy .

     <p>Furthermore, the lost privacy is not without gain. Every time Alice
     visits a virtual storefront that has been customized to her
     preferences, her search time is reduced, and she is more likely to
     find what she wants - even if she didn't know she wanted it - and
     the more information the merchant has about her, the more true this
     will be.

     <p>The picture becomes even more complicated once one begins to treat
     privacy itself as a legitimate consumer preference rather than as
     merely an intermediate good. Once one accepts that consumers may
     have a taste for privacy, it is no longer obvious that the
     transparent consumer is an efficient solution for the management of
     customer data. Relaxing an economic assumption does not, however,
     change anything about actual behavior, and the same tendencies that
     push the market toward a world in which consumer data is a valuable
     and much-traded commodity persist.

     <p>Indeed, basic ideas of privacy are under assault. Data miners and
     consumer profilers are able to produce detailed pictures of the
     tastes and habits of increasing numbers of consumers. The spread of
     intelligent traffic management systems and video security and
     recognition systems, and the gradual integration of information
     systems built into every appliance, will eventually make it
     possible to track movement as well as purchases. Once one person
     has this information, there is, of course, almost no cost for
     making it available to all.

     <p>Unfortunately, it is difficult to measure the demand for privacy.
     Furthermore, the structure of the legal system does not tend to
     allow consumers to express this preference. Today, most consumer
     transactions are governed by standard-form contracts. The default
     rules may be constrained by state consumer law, or by portions of
     the Uniform Commercial Code, but they generally derive most of
     their content from boilerplate language written by a merchant's
     lawyer. If you are buying a dishwasher, you do not get to haggle
     over the terms of the contract, which (in the rare case that they
     are even read) are found in small print somewhere on the invoice.

     <p>Although it is possible to imagine a world in which the Internet
     allows for negotiation of contractual terms even in consumer sales,
     we have yet to hear of a single example of this phenomenon, and see
     little reason to expect it. On the contrary, to the extent that a
     trend can be discerned, it is in the other direction, toward the
     "Web-wrap" or "clip-wrap" contract (the neologisms derive from
     "shrink-wrap" contracts, in which the buyer of software is informed
     that she will agree to the terms by opening the wrapper), in which
     the consumer is asked to agree to the contract before being allowed
     to view the Web site's content. Indeed, the enforcement of these
     agreements is enshrined in law in the proposed, and very
     controversial, Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act.

     

<h>The Next Economics?

     <p>We have argued that assumptions that underlie the microeconomics of
     the invisible hand will fray when they are transported into
     tomorrow's information economy. Commodities that take the form of
     single physical objects are rivalrous and are excludable. There is
     only one of a given item, and if it is locked up in the seller's
     shop, no one else can use it. The structure of the distribution
     network delivered marketplace transparency as a cheap byproduct of
     getting the goods to their purchasers. All these assumptions did
     fail at the margin, but the match of the real to the ideal was
     reasonably good.

     <p>Modest as they may be in comparison to the issues we have left for
     another day, our observations about microfoundations do have some
     implications for economic theory and for policy. At some point
     soon, it will become practical to charge for everything on the
     World Wide Web. Whether it will become economically feasible, or
     common, remains to be seen. The outcome of this battle will have
     profound economic and social consequences.

     <p>Consider just two polar possibilities. On the one hand, one can
     envision a hybrid gift-exchange model, in which most people pay as
     much for access to Web content as they pay for NPR, and in which
     the few who value an in-depth information edge or
     speed-of-information acquisition pay more. At the other extreme,
     one can as easily foresee a world in which great efforts have been
     made to reproduce familiar aspects of the traditional model of
     profit maximization.

     <p>Which vision will dominate, absent government intervention, depends
     in part on the human motivation of programmers, authors and other
     content providers. The invisible hand assumed a "rational economic
     man," a greedy human. The cybernetic human could be very greedy,
     for greed can be automated. But much progress in basic science and
     technology has always been based on other motivations than money.
     The thrill of the chase, the excitement of discovery, and the
     respect of one's peers have played a very large role as well,
     perhaps helped along by the occasional Nobel Prize, knighthood for
     services to science, or a distinguished chair; in the future,
     "Net.Fame" may join the list.

     <p>Government will surely be called upon to intervene. Adam Smith said
     that eighteenth-century "statesmen" could in most cases do the most
     good by sitting on their hands. The twenty-first-century
     "stateswomen" will have to decide whether this advice still applies
     after the fit between the institutions of market exchange and
     production and distribution technologies has decayed.

     <p>We suspect that policies that ensure diversity of providers will
     continue to have their place. One of the biggest benefits of a
     market economy is that it provides for sunset. When faced with
     competition, relatively inefficient organizations fail to take in
     revenue to cover their costs, and then they die. Competition is
     thus still a virtue, whether the governing framework is one of
     gift-exchange or buy-and-sell - unless competition destroys the
     ability to capture significant economies of scale.

     <p>The challenge for policy makers is likely to be particularly acute
     in the face of technological attempts to recreate familiar market
     relationships. That markets characterized by the properties of
     rivalry, excludability and transparency are efficient does not mean
     that any effort to reintroduce these properties to a market lacking
     them necessarily increases social welfare. Furthermore, in some
     cases the new, improved, versions may provide more excludability or
     transparency than did the old model; this raises new problems.
     Holders of intellectual property rights in digital information, be
     they producers or sellers, do have a strong incentive to
     reintroduce rivalry and excludability into the market for digital
     information.

  <h>Increasing Excludability

     <p>It appears increasingly likely that technological advances such as
     "digital watermarks" will allow each copy of a digital data set, be
     it a program or a poem, to be uniquely identified. If these are
     coupled with appropriate legal sanctions for unlicensed copying, a
     large measure of excludability can be restored to the market .
     Policy makers will need to be particularly alert to three dangers:

     <p>First, technologies that permit excludability risk introducing
     socially unjustified costs if the methods of policing excludability
     are themselves costly.

     <p>Second, as the example of broadcast television demonstrates,
     imperfect substitutes for excludability can themselves have bad
     consequences that are sometimes difficult to anticipate.

     <p>Third, over-perfect forms of excludability raise the possibility
     that traditional limits on excludability of information such as
     "fair use" might be changed by technical means without the
     political and social debate that should precede such a shift.

     <p>We counsel caution. In the absence of any clear indication of what
     the optimum would be, the burden of proof should be on those who
     argue that any level of excludability should be mandated. This
     applies particularly to information that is not the content being
     sold but that is instead about the current state of the market
     itself. There is a long tradition that information about the state
     of the marketplace should be as widely broadcast as possible.
     We cannot see any economic arguments against this tradition.

     <p>In particular, reforming the law to give sellers a property right
     in information about the prices that they charge appears extremely
     dangerous. There has never in the past been a legal right to
     exclude competitors from access to bulk pricing data. It is hard to
     see what improvement in economic efficiency could follow from the
     creation of such a right in the future.

  <h>Increasing Rivalry

     <p>It is equally hard to imagine how rivalry might be re-created for
     digitized data without using an access system that relies on a
     hardware token of some sort or on continuing interaction between
     the seller and the buyer. Rivalry can be reintroduced if access to
     a program, a document, or other digital data can be conditioned on
     access to a particular "smart card" or other physical object. Or
     rivalry can be reintroduced by requiring the user to get permission
     every time the data are accessed, permitting the data provider to
     confirm, via IP lookup, caller ID, or some other means, that the
     data are being used by the credentialed user. Perhaps a
     cryptographically based software analog might be developed that
     relied on some secret that the purchaser would have a strong
     incentive to keep to herself. In each case, a form of rivalry
     results, since multiple users can be prevented from using the data
     simultaneously.

     <p>But imposing rivalry where it is not naturally found means imposing
     a socially unnecessary cost on someone. The result may look and
     feel like a traditional market, but it cannot, by definition, carry
     the "optimality" properties markets have possessed in the past. The
     artificial creation of rivalry ensures that many users whose
     willingness to pay for a good is greater than the (near-zero)
     marginal cost of producing another copy will not get one.

     <p>Policy makers should therefore be very suspicious of any
     market-based arguments for artificial rivalry.

  <h>Increasing Transparency

     <p>It might seem that anything that encourages transparency must be
     good. Indeed, all other things being equal, for consumers, for
     merchants selling products that can survive scrutiny, and for the
     economy as a whole, increases in the transparency of product
     markets are always a good thing. The issue, however, is to what
     extent this logic justifies a transparent consumer.

     <p>The answer is fundamentally political. It depends on the extent to
     which one is willing to recognize privacy as an end in itself. If
     information about consumers is just a means to an economic end,
     there is no reason for concern. If, on the other hand, citizens
     perceive maintaining control over facts about their economic
     actions as a good in itself, some sort of governmental intervention
     in the market may be needed to make it easier for this preference
     to express itself.

  <h>Policy Hazards in the New Economy

     <p>We have focused on the ways in which digital media undermine the
     assumptions of rivalry, excludability and transparency, and have
     tried to suggest that the issue of transparency is at least as
     important, complicated and interesting as the other two. In so
     doing, we have been forced to slight important microeconomic
     features of the next economy. We have not, for example, discussed
     the extent to which the replacement of human salespeople, travel
     agents and shop assistants will affect the labor market.

     <p>The consequences may be earthshaking. For about two centuries
     starting in 1800, technological progress was the friend of the
     unskilled worker. It provided a greater relative boost to the
     demand for workers who were relatively unskilled (who could tighten
     bolts on the assembly line, or move things about so that the
     automated production process could use them, or watch largely
     self-running machines and call for help when they stopped) than for
     those who were skilled. The spread of industrial civilization was
     associated with a great leveling in the distribution of income. But
     there is nothing inscribed in the nature of reality to the effect
     that technological progress must always boost the relative wages of
     the unskilled.

     <p>Nor have we addressed potentially compensating factors such as the
     looming disaggregation of the university, a scenario in which
     "distance learning" bridges the gap between elite lecturers and
     mass audiences, turning many educational institutions into little
     more than degree-granting standards bodies, with financial aid and
     counseling functions next to a gym or (just maybe) a library. While
     this may benefit the mass audience, it has harmful effects on one
     elite. It risks creating an academic proletariat made up of those
     who would have been well-paid professors before the triumph of
     "distance learning" over the lecture hall.

     <p>Along a number of dimensions, there is good reason to fear that the
     enormous economies of scale found in the production of
     non-rivalrous commodities are pushing us in the direction of a
     winner-take-all economy. The long-run impact of the information
     revolution on the distribution of income and wealth is something
     that we have not even begun to analyze.

     <p>Similarly, we have completely ignored a number of interesting
     macroeconomic issues. Traditional ideas of the "open" and "closed"
     economy will have to be re-thought on sectoral grounds. Once a
     nation becomes part of the global information infrastructure, its
     ability to raise either tariff or non-tariff walls against certain
     foreign trade activities becomes vanishingly small. Nations will
     not, for example, be able to protect an "infant" software industry.
     It will be hard to enforce labor laws when the jobs are taken by
     telecommuters.

                               

     <p>National accounts are already becoming increasingly inaccurate as
     it becomes harder and harder to track imports and exports.
     Governments are unable to distinguish the arrival of a personal
     letter, with a picture attached, from the electronic delivery of a
     $100,000 piece of software. Monetary and financial economics will
     also have to adapt.

     <p>Traditionally, the field of economics has always had some
     difficulty explaining money. There has been something
     "sociological" about the way tokens worthless in themselves get and
     keep their value that is hard to fit with economists' underlying
     explanatory strategies of rational agents playing games of exchange
     with one another. These problems will intensify as the nature and
     varieties of money change. The introduction of digital currencies
     suggests a possible return of private currencies. It threatens the
     end of seigneurage, and raises questions about who can control the
     national money supply .

     <p>The market system may well prove to be tougher than its traditional
     defenders have thought, and to have more subtle and powerful
     advantages than those that defenders of the invisible hand have
     usually listed. At the very least, however, defenders will need new
     arguments. Economic theorists have enormous powers of resilience.
     Economists regularly try to spawn new theories - today,
     evolutionary economics, the economics of organizations and
     bureaucracies, public choice theory and the economics of networks.

     <p>Experience suggests that the regulations for tomorrow's economy are
     likely to be written today. That means policy choices will be made
     in advance of both theory and practice, and with disproportionate
     input from those who have the most to lose from change, or who have
     garnered short-term first-mover advantages from the first stage of
     the transition now under way. If we are correct in believing that
     some of the basic assumptions that drive most thinking about the
     market (and most introductory economics classes) will not hold up
     well in the online economy, it is particularly important for those
     choices to be made with care. [endof.gif]

     Smith's day had very good reason to dispute such a claim.

     <l>8. When the Wall Street Journal sells a Berkeley economics
     professor an annual subscription to its e-version, does it imagine
     that the same user's identification-and-password might be used in
     one day to access the e-version by the professor at work, by a
     research assistant working from home on the professor's behalf, and
     by the professor's spouse at another office? Probably not.

     <l>10. That excludability is a very important foundation for the
     market is suggested by the fact that governments felt compelled to
     invent it. Excludability does not exist in a Hobbesian state of
     nature. The laws of physics do not prohibit people from sneaking in
     and taking your things; the police and the judges do. Indeed, most
     of what we call "the rule of law" consists of a legal system that
     enforces excludability. Enforcement of excludability ("protection
     of my property rights," even when the commodity is simply sitting
     there unused and idle) is one of the few tasks that the theory of
     laissez-faire allows the government. The importance of this
     "artificial" creation of excludability is rarely remarked on. Fish
     are supposed to rarely remark on the water in which they swim. See

     Electronic Frontier. Reading, Mass.: Addison-Wesley.

     <l>11. In large part because the government did not restructure
     property rights to help them. Had the government made the legal
     right to own a TV conditional on one's purchase of a
     program-viewing license, the development of the industry might well
     have been different. And such a conditioning of legal right would
     have been technologically enforceable. As British billboards used
     to say: "Beware! TV locator vans are in your neighborhood!"

     <l>13. It is worth noting that in the debate over Microsoft in the
     second half of the 1990s, virtually no one proposed a Federal
     Operating System Commission to regulate Microsoft as the FCC had
     regulated the Bell System. The dilemmas that had led to the
     Progressive-era proposed solution were stronger than ever. But
     there was no confidence in that solution to be found anywhere.

     <l>30. For example, consider this: "Technology has set into motion
     dazzling challenges to market mechanisms whose free market dynamism
     is being impeded by anti-competitive handcuffs imposed by
     participants and sanctioned by regulators. A free market is
     nurtured by a culture of disclosure and equal access to information
     that fuels rather than fetters the marketplace. The dangers are
     real and the opportunities abundant. The efficiency and expanse of
     an unburdened open market is limitless. Tear down the barriers to
     competition, remove the obstacles to greater innovation, spotlight
     all conflicts of interest, and unleash the flow of timely and
     accurate information, and our markets - like never before - will be
     driven by the power and the brilliance of the human spirit." SEC
