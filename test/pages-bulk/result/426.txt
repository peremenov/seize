<h>Tech Smart:
<h>Making Discerning Technology Choices

                             <h>By Jamie McKenzie

   <p>Two decades after the introduction of personal computers in the
   nation, with almost all schools wired for the Internet and nearly $6
   billion spent annually on school technologies, the results get a
   failing grade.

             <p>Larry Cuban
          "System Crash."
          Boston Daily Globe 
          November 25, 2001

   <p>For decades, Larry Cuban has been noting the failures of new
   technologies to influence or improve the daily practice of teachers in
   their classrooms.  Despite more than twenty years of fumbling efforts,
   we still tend to put the cart before the horse, believing foolishly
   that new laptops or handheld devices will teach Joan and Johnny how to
   read or grasp mathematical functions.

   <p>By now we should have learned that toolishness is foolishness.
   Showering fancy equipment and toys on classrooms without smart
   planning is unlikely to produce gains in student performance.

   <p>It is not that all new technologies must fail.  Achievement of
   learning goals with new technologies requires a blend of powerful
   professional development, program development and discernment.  There
   are many dumb ways to use the new tools that will create no changes
   worth noting.  There are other smart uses that promise to sharpen the
   analysis, interpretation, inference and synthesis skills of students.

   <p>This article is about wise choices - Smart Tech!

   <p>When we approach the adoption of new tools and practices with
   discernment, gains in student performance are more likely to accrue.

   <h>discernment

  <l> 1. The act or process of exhibiting keen insight and good judgment.

   <l>2. Keenness of insight and judgment.

   <h>The American Heritage¨ Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth
   Edition.  2000.

   <p>Teachers and administrators may combine and orchestrate a dozen
   strategies to achieve discerning use of new technologies.  These
   strategies help sort through the noise of conflicting marketing claims
   to focus upon value, reliability, authenticity and results.

   <l>1.    Prospecting - Looking for the right combination of promising
   program elements and indicators. in the January 2002 issue of
   Multimedia Schools.  See " Prospecting for Digital Riches."

   <l>2.  Focusing - Keeping an eye on prime philosophical commitments and
   program purposes.

   <p>This effort is not about networking schools just to be networked.  It
   is not about installing the latest technologies and digital toys just
   to stay ahead of neighboring districts or schools.  We must not
   embrace technology for technology's sake.  It is neither
   PowerPointlessness nor Tomfoolery nor mere handholding (as in handheld
   devices).  We should only acquire new technologies that will improve
   student performance on learning tasks that match state curriculum
   standards or address important local learning goals.

   <p>Smart districts create brief, four-to-five paragraph summaries of the
   learning goals to be addressed with new tools.  These clear statements
   are drawn from the staff, refined, carefully discussed and then widely
   distributed once final drafts are approved.  Walk into any classroom
   and ask the teacher what the district is hoping to achieve, and she or
   he will be able to answer succinctly.

   <p>"We hope to improve the information literacy skills of all our
   students by challenging them with problems drawn from the curriculum.
   We emphasize analysis, inference, interpretation and synthesis - just
   like the state standards."

   <p>Such belief statements help to screen out unworthy technology
   programs, products and activities.  If programs do not deliver the
   kind of student learning chosen by the district, they do not qualify
   for purchase.  Virus protection!

   <p>For more on this strategy, consult "First Things First" in the
   November/December 2000 issue of From Now On at
   http://fno.org/nov00/f1.html.

   <l>3. Challenging - Demanding evidence, data, results and substantive
   theoretical underpinnings.  Considering the risks, the costs and the
   dangers.

   <p>We are often assured by vendors and program cheerleaders that new
   tools and products will shift classroom practice and results
   dramatically.  But where's the beef?  These claims and promises are
   rarely substantiated with program data gathered in a credible
   fashion.  In most cases, the data is what might be called "testimonial
   research" - meaning that we are shown a bunch of rave reviews by
   pioneering teachers and administrators who swear that the classroom,
   the school and the district were transformed by the innovation.

   <p>"But what happened to the reading and writing scores of students?"

   <p>In those cases with numerical data showing student progress, the
   design of the experiment is often seriously flawed, allowing
   volunteer, pioneering teachers to teach the experimental classes, for
   example, while non-volunteer teachers are left as control groups.  The
   resulting "progress" may be heavily tinged by the special qualities of
   the volunteer teachers as well as what is known as the Hawthorne
   Effect - the tendency for any group getting special attention to
   improve performance because they are being watched,

   <p>For decades, consumers have turned to Consumer Reports to compare the
   gas mileage, safety records and repair records of various
   automobiles.  The same kind of data gathering makes sense when it
   comes to technology shopping.

   <p>But the data should include more than evidence of success.  A smart
   technology planning team looks at the dark side of any innovation and
   tries to discover what might possibly go wrong.  Technology proponents
   and vendors will often hype the innovation and emphasize nothing but
   the positive.  Without a full understanding of the risks and
   challenges likely to accompany the product or program, the chances of
   making a successful launch are reduced significantly.  See "The Post
   Installation Action Plan" in the November/December, 2001 issue of From
   Now On at http://fno.org/nov01/postinstallationplan.html

   <l>4.    Testing - Setting up small, low-risk pilot programs and
   reviewing the results of others' pilot tests.

   <p>The fashion these days is to plunge into major initiatives without
   running pilot programs to assess their worth and then determine how to
   adjust the programs to work well under local conditions.

   <p>This elimination of conservative change strategies is a side product
   of the boom times of the 1990s as industries and schools joined
   together to build electronic highways that seemed to promise wondrous
   futures for us all.  Sadly, the dot.com bubble burst and the
   extravagant investments in infrastructure have not produced the
   expected profits and benefits in either world.

   <l>5. Investigating - Looking past the surface claims to find out what
   really happens when the tools and practices are installed and
   implemented.  Finding prior innovators to learn the "true story" of
   what happened.

   <p>Which implementation models are most likely to produce learning gains?

   <p>To avoid repeating the mistakes of early adopters, if an innovation
   has already been field tested by other schools, a wise team devotes
   considerable time and attention to considering what others have
   learned. This learning requires considerable tact and skill because
   many early adopters may promote the innovation without sharing stories
   of frustration and disappointment.

   <p>The trick is to find innovators who can be trusted to share the trials
   and the tribulations as well as the triumphs. This search for verity
   often requires some probing past leadership levels to see what
   rank-and-file teachers report about the innovation experience.

   <p>The important words are "likely to produce learning gains." This is
   not about flash or excitement and fireworks. We are looking for solid
   results substantiated by concrete data. Testimonials are abundant but
   rarely reliable.

   <p>When early adopters claim glorious results, it pays to ask, "How do
   you know? What evidence do you have?"

   <l>6. Comparing - Examining the full range of choices (vendors and
   models, for example) within a category along with alternatives that
   are substantially different.

   <p>In some cases, options may narrow too quickly, as what seem to be
   special opportunities sweep the district along a path that does not
   allow for comparison shopping. Perhaps a vendor offers a "deal" that
   means the district will be first in the region. This kind of program
   glory may seduce leaders into premature commitment.   It may even feel
   comforting for some time to focus energy on a narrow range of program
   strategies, but wisdom calls for a more deliberate approach that
   weighs the pros and cons of different approaches, avoiding traps
   associated with infatuation.

   <l>7. Remembering - Reviewing past experiences with innovations (and
   vendors) that promised similar results and changes.

   <p>Memory can fail, sadly - especially when it comes to recalling
   missteps.  Denial is a serious liability when trying to learn from
   one's previous mistakes. Institutional memory loss allows a pattern of
   blunders to persist.

   <p>The serious study of organizational history is an essential safeguard
   against perpetual stumbling.

   <p>Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.

                                                         George Santayana

   <p>To some extent, the process of implementing innovations requires a
   trial-and-error adjustment of strategies in line with experience.
   Lessons from the past should prove illuminating and instructive when
   launching new efforts, but in many cases, the leaders of the earlier
   efforts may have moved on, taking history with them, or the
   organization may be inclined to admire the emperor's old clothes as
   well as the new ones.

   <p>A healthy organization heeds the lessons both of research and
   history.  For more on this approach to leadership, consult "Beware the
   Shallow Waters! The Dangers of Ignoring History and the Research on
   Change in Schools," in the June, 1999 issue of From Now On at
   http://fno.org/jun99/teach.html.

   <l>8. Triangulating - Developing multiple, independent, potentially
   conflicting sources to support the evaluation process.

   <p>In the search for verity, we compare and contrast testimonials. We
   seek out the naysayers in order to balance and assess the claims of
   the cheerleaders and the promoters.

   <p>When the principal or superintendent claims heavy and effective use of
   the innovation, we ask for data.

   <p>"How do you know that?"

   <p>If the teachers report 30% utilization weekly of curriculum rich,
   technology enhanced lessons, what do their students report?  Do the
   numbers match?

   <p>If we simply take notes when sitting at technology conferences, we
   become the blind following the blind.

   <p>Informed skepticism requires some detective work and some off the
   record conversations. Much of this negative content would not normally
   find its way to conferences or into publications inclined to trumpet
   the wonders of technologies (and advertisers).

   <p>School leaders need workshop sessions and articles that share openly
   the obstacles and challenges one is likely to encounter.  In those
   same sessions, innovators offer antidotes and strategies to avoid
   those pitfalls.

   <l>9.    Debunking - Stripping off the hype, the marketing claims, the
   myths and all excessive promises to consider the prospects for success
   rationally and analytically.

   <p>Technology cheerleaders often create pressures for change and the
   purchase of more equipment by suggesting that the failure to keep up
   with the toys of one's neighbors will lead to severe deprivation - a
   future marked by unemployment in some digital (dot.com?) workplace.
   The "Digital Divide" sometimes seems more like a marketing ploy than a
   reality, as vendors wring their hands over the gap (in purchasing)
   between rich and poor districts. The vendors' concern seems
   disingenuous at best, since recent Market Data Retrieval reports
   (cited in Cuban's article) show little effective use of networked
   computers by most teachers.

   <p>The real question - mentioned earlier - is whether this innovation
   will produce learning gains.  The best measure of this goal would be
   educational assessments aimed at the analysis, interpretation,
   inference and synthesis skills required by tough state or provincial
   curriculum standards.

   <p>Technology cheerleaders are fond of separate technology standards,
   assessments and programs, enshrining such dubious skills as
   powerpointlessness and handholding as major program objectives.

   <p>Educators should focus on teaching students to read for meaning in
   books and on screens.  Reading e-books on a handheld device is a
   trivial goal.  Interpreting a passage from Macbeth is challenging
   regardless of whether the words appear on paper or a screen.
   Providing handheld CliffNotes is unlikely to promote original thought
   or develop interpretative skills.

   <p>When new technologies make it easier to slide by on the thinking of
   others, they do this generation of students a disservice - a point
   that some companies seem to miss as they announce the availability of
   handheld CliffNotes with pride.

   <p>Promoters of new technologies offer packages of fabulous new century
   skills that suggest that being modern requires being equipped.
   Ironically, many of the skills in their package are not at all new.
   Many can be taught without digital devices.  Their not having been
   taught in the past was not because we had the wrong tools.  The
   explanation for failure to teach those skills is rooted in social and
   organizational patterns that are deeply set in our culture.

   <p>Hank Becker (1999) reports that some 70 per cent of the teachers in
   his national study are quite traditional in their approaches to
   classroom activities.  There is no evidence that these teaching styles
   or strategies change when computers are placed in the classroom.  To
   the contrary, Becker found they let students use the equipment
   one-third as often as their more constructivist colleagues.
<p>   Teachers since Socrates have struggled to develop the thinking,
   problem solving and questioning skills of their students, but now we
   are told that an educated citizenry must be wired and digitally
   savvy.  The implication is that the new technologies will promote a
   new, more powerful literacy.  Yet we see little attention to emerging
   problems associated with such tools - the powerpointessness,
   cut-and-paste thinking, new plagiarism, info-glut and mentalsoftness
   reported by many teachers and commentators who see the Internet and
   digital resources as a mixed blessing.

   <p>The real question is whether this innovation will produce learning
   gains.

   <l>10. Deconstructing - Breaking the innovation into its component parts
   to see how well they fit together, how they are meant to work and
   where the vulnerabilities may lie.

   <p>How is this program supposed to work?

   <p>Packaged programs imported from outside a school district rarely
   succeed unless customized to match local conditions and special needs.

   <p>The process of deconstructing a program is a bit like taking apart a
   lawn mower or automobile engine back in the days when there were few
   electronic parts.  By disassembling the motor or program into its
   parts, program managers may consider modifications and adjustments.

   <p>A district might identify a successful writing program that employs
   Inspiration(TM) and wireless laptops, for example, to teach students
   writing as process within the guidelines and expectations of state
   standards.  Upon close examination and deconstruction, the district
   team determines that the program needs bolstering at the idea
   generating and the editing phases.  Because the district has already
   invested heavily in an approach to editing and revision called "The
   Six Traits Approach to Writing," the team protects that investment by
   adding it as a major program component.  They then go in search of
   idea generation strategies to enhance the model.

   <p>In many cases, innovations proceed to installation as if such
   tinkering and adjustment is unnecessary and burdensome, but a failure
   to modify a program may undermine past efforts like the one mentioned
   above and may also limit the potential of the new program to shift
   daily practice.

   <l>11. Inventing and Evaluating Locally - Engaging local staff members in
   the development and testing of innovations so they have first hand
   knowledge of what works and what does not work, thereby reducing
   dependence on and vulnerability to outside promoters.

   <p>Homegrown innovations may stand a reasonable chance of taking root,
   especially if the district nurtures the development of human resources
   devoted to the invention process.  This process requires cultivation,
   encouragement and investment.

   <p>See "Creating the Vanguard: Identifying, Grooming and Rewarding the
   Champions" at http://staffdevelop.org/cadre.html.

   <p>Metaphors drawn from the world of gardening may provide illuminating
   insights for those planning innovations.  If we are doing our jobs
   well, we will be raising seedlings in hothouses, testing them,
   clearing areas, weeding, cultivating the soil, fertilizing, planting,
   weeding, pruning, thinning and weeding some more.

   <p>We are careful to plant where conditions are right.  Unfortunately,
   some school planners leave out some of the most important steps in the
   planning (or gardening) process, installing a network without
   cultivating the soil - without investing in program development or
   professional development.  They may plant desktop units where there is
   little willingness to use them, the equivalent of planting sun hungry
   plants in heavily shaded areas.

   <p>Most of these missteps occur because these planners do not view the
   change process as organic. They focus on wires, cables and equipment.
   They neglect the human and organizational elements that are basic to a
   thriving and robust effort.

   <p>But invention is not enough by itself.  Unless informed and guided by
   astute data collection to assess which aspects are proving effective,
   the innovation can turn into a new suit of clothes for whatever
   emperors are shopping.

   <l>12. Delaying - Slowing down the purchase and installation process so
   that schools can learn from the mistakes of others - avoiding the
   bleeding edge of change.

          <p>Slow down, you move too fast. 
          You got to make the morning last.

                                                     Paul Simon

   <p>When it comes to networking schools and classrooms or adopting new
   technologies, some leaders tend to rush things.  Just as folk wisdom
   argues that "Haste makes waste," research on change in schools warns
   against riding change mobiles through avalanche territory (Fullan,
   1991).

   <p>Even though the shortest distance is usually a straight line, most
   road and railway

   <p>builders know better than to head straight up a mountain without
   providing plenty of curves.  They rely on switchbacks to keep the
   angle of ascent reasonable.  They know engines have their limits.

   <p>Schools should follow this example. They should make the strategic
   pacing of change a priority if they hope to see a real (and
   beneficial) shift in classroom practice.

   <p>See "Pacing Change," an article that originally appeared in the
   September 2000 issue of Classroom Connect.
   http://fno.org/nov00/pacing.html

   <p>There are many advantages to delay when it comes to new technologies.
    School districts that come to the game late may find that slow and
   discerning decision making means they leapfrogged over some of the
   silly and misguided efforts of their neighbors.

   <p>Sometimes it turns out that we end up ahead of the game by letting
   other fools rush in.
