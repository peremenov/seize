<h>LABOUR MANIFESTO 'GREENER THAN TORIES' SAY FOE

   <p>Friends of the Earth today (3/4/97) welcomed the publication of the
   Labour Party manifesto as stronger on environmental programmes than
   the Conservatives.
   Charles Secrett, Executive Director of Friends of the Earth, said:

   <p>"This is the greenest general election manifesto ever produced by the
   Labour Party,although there are significant omissions. It is much
   stronger on environmental programmes, and reveals a deeper
   understanding of environmental priorities, than the Conservative
   manifesto published yesterday. It is full of general policy
   commitments to green energy, industry, agriculture, and international
   institutions that should be sweet music to the ears of
   environmentalists all over the country.

   <p>Friends of the Earth warmly welcomes Labour's recognition that
   environmental priorities must be fully integrated with all other
   policy areas, and the environmental agenda must be delivered across
   Westminster and Whitehall. We are pleased that the public health, jobs
   and export opportunities of cutting pollution and conserving resources
   are clearly spelled out and that Labour will regulate to clean up the
   environment.

   <p>But it is not all good news. There are significant omissions, a
   worrying lack of detail and a weasly choice of words in some areas,
   notably over transport priorities and green tax reform. It is a big
   mistake not to have set goals to reduce traffic levels or guarantee
   environmental rights for all citizens. We do not understand how Labour
   can meet its strong CO2 reduction target, while lowering energy prices
   by reducing VAT on fuel use to 5%. FOE also regrets the lack of more
   specific targets and timetables to cut pollution and waste,similar to
   its welcome commitment to cut CO2 emissions by 20% by 2010. For Labour
   to fulfill its promise to be 'the greenest Government yet' it must set
   out detailed policy goals,backed up by specific tax, expenditure and
   regulatory action programmes.
   At long last, Labour has thrown down a green gauntlet to the Liberal
   Democrats. Overall,Labour's manifesto challenges the Liberal
   Democrats' record as the greenest of the mainstream Parties in the
   UK."
