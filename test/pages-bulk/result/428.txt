   <h>USDA Sold Potentially Toxic Corn to Food and Feed Handler
   May Have Violated Cargill Policy and Monsanto Grower Agreement
   <p>DES MOINES, IOWA - An environmental group and an animal welfare
   organization today jointly released evidence that, for a second time,
   the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) sold corn that one
   of its own researchers said might be toxic. The groups raised concern
   that the suspect corn may end up being used as animal feed or even in
   grocery products, posing a risk to health. The corn, a genetically
   engineered variety not approved for sale as food in the European
   Union, was apparently delivered to a Cargill processing facility in
   Blair, Neb.
   <p>Friends of the Earth (FoE) and The Humane Society of the United States
   (HSUS) obtained copies of receipts for sale of more than 18,000
   bushels of corn marketed by the Commodities Credit Corporation on
   behalf of the USDA's Farm Services Agency (FSA). It was sold Feb. 3 to
   Feb. 6 to Koster Grain Company, a handler of corn for food and feed in
   Carroll, Iowa. The USDA's own researchers suspect the corn caused
   severe reproductive problems in pigs in Iowa. It is also a variety
   genetically engineered by Monsanto (MON) to be resistant to the
   herbicide Roundup.
   <p>According to a May 15 report on CropChoice.com, "one of the haulers,
   who wished to remain anonymous, said he took the corn to the Cargill
   plant in Blair, Neb." Cargill has an explicit policy to reject Roundup
   Ready corn at its Blair, Neb. facility since the European Union and
   other export markets won't accept this type of genetically engineered
   corn. The policy is posted on Cargill's Web site and in its e-mail
   newsletter to growers.
   <p>To avoid these problems, Monsanto requires growers to deliver its
   Roundup Ready corn to designated handlers. As of May 15, Koster Grain
   was not on the American Seed Trade Association's list of handlers that
   accept Roundup Ready corn (see http://asta.farmprogress.com - no
   www.).
   <p>"It appears that the USDA violated an Iowa farmer's grower agreement
   with Monsanto and they may have sold Cargill truckloads of corn that
   nobody would want to get caught using as food," said Lori Sokolowski a
   member of the Iowa Farmers Union.
   <p>The corn originated on the farm operated by Jerry Rosman, an Iowa
   farmer whose hogs suffered unexplained reproductive failure in 2000
   and 2001. A lead researcher at the USDA's Agricultural Research
   Service in Ames, Iowa, wrote in August that, "one possible cause of
   this problem may be the presence of an unanticipated, biologically
   active, chemical compound within the corn." Researchers at Iowa State
   later released a statement saying that genetically engineered Bt corn
   was not the cause of swine reproductive failures experienced by
   numerous local farmers. The researchers did not conclude whether some
   other aspect of the corn was causing the problems.
   <p>"This is worse than USDA oversights involving biopharmaceutical corn
   contamination of soybeans last year. In this case, the USDA is the
   party responsible for putting a crop with a potentially harmful
   substance into food and feed channels," said Larry Bohlen, director of
   Health and Environment Programs at Friends of the Earth.
   <p>In a letter to the USDA last fall, FoE urgently appealed to USDA
   Secretary Veneman to obtain all of the corn to save it for science, as
   well as keep it off the market until researchers find the source of
   reproductive problems. The USDA wrote a response, Oct. 29, saying that
   USDA "scientists are testing the corn to determine if it contains a
   novel toxin that might impact swine production."
   <p>Then in a fax from FSA to Friends of the Earth Feb. 5, an FSA official
   claims that the USDA tested for one compound known to cause
   reproductive problems in lab animals and could not find it, but "did
   not test the samples for any other compounds." Farmer and
   environmental advocates have asked the USDA why the corn was sold
   before the mystery was solved and when they expect the investigation
   to be completed.
   <p>"At a time when independent hog farmers are struggling with record-low
   prices, they cannot afford to be impacted by a problem that has been
   largely ignored by the USDA. We hope that the USDA will take action
   before more farmers like Jerry Rosman are forced out of business,"
   said Chris Bedford, Farm Animal and Sustainable Agriculture Campaign
   coordinator.
   <p>By a twist of legal fate, the USDA's FSA took possession of 19,000
   bushels of corn from the 2001 Rolling R Farm harvest in Harlan, Iowa.
   It was used as collateral on a loan to the operation once managed by
   farmer Jerry Rosman. USDA officials in Washington, D.C., had directed
   the FSA to not sell the corn for food or feed. The FSA attempted in
   late 2002 to sell the corn for ethanol production to Tall Corn
   Ethanol, a local processor, which rejected it. A byproduct of ethanol
   is gluten, used in animal feed and human food, raising concern that
   any problem with the corn might enter the food chain. The FSA sale in
   February follows one it made in January of 950 bushels to G & R Grain
   and Feed Company of Portsmouth, Iowa.
   <p>The reproductive problem experienced by Rosman's sows is called
   pseudopregnancy and is characterized by false pregnancy, in which the
   animal exhibits the signs of pregnancy for a full term but carries no
   fetus. The Rolling R Farm is not the only operation to suffer the
   problem. According to IFU, which has been running radio announcements
   and print ads with HSUS in Farm News and Iowa Farmer Today (NE & NW
   editions) to assess the extent of the problem, more than 20 farmers
   have been impacted. The organizations continue to take calls from
   concerned farmers, and they plan to put these farmers in touch with
   researchers interested in solving the pregnancy problems.
