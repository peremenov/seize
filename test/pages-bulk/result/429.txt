                  <h>Kenya;the Sondu-Miriu Hydropower Project
    Letter from Argwings Odera to Prime Minister Mori (January 08,2001)
                                 [bar.gif]

   <p>Dear Mr Prime Minister,

   <p>This is the most painful letter I have ever written. Painful because
   the middle finger of my left hand is fractured. Broken on December 26
   by Konoike security guards near the Sondu-Miriu Hydropower Project in
   Nyanza, Kenya. This fracture was made worse by Kenya police who
   tortured me. It was then aggravated by fellow hardcore inmates who
   beat me on orders from the police.

   <p>My left shoulder aches. The outcome of a bullet graze that was aimed
   for my head by Kenya police on the same date. It was meant to be
   fatal, I was told by police commander Kola of Ahero police station.

   <p>He told me: My orders were to shoot you dead. I would have been
   charged with murder. Then I would have spent seven years in prison. I
   was going to come out definitely. But when do you think you would have
   come out of your grave?

   <p>What am I talking about? Perhaps I have put the proverbial cart before
   the horse. I introduce myself.

   <p>My name is Argwings Odera. I am the person co-ordinating the human
   rights campaign in Nyanza and efforts to save the Sondu-Miriu river
   from the overwhelming negative impacts of a 80 MW hydropower project
   initiated in 1999. This is a project funded by the Japanese
   government. Over 200,000 people are affected negatively.

   <p>This is the third time I am being arrested because of our activities
   at the project. We were first arrested and detained for two days
   sometimes in November 1999. Then we were arrested again, with about 20
   others, on February 28, 2000, detained for a day at Ahero police
   station and released without charge.

   <p>What did I do this time round? Mine was a case of shoot the messenger
   before he delivers the news. My colleagues and I had held a meeting on
   December 19 with the country representative of JBIC in his Nairobi
   offices. We outlined the problems of Sondu-Miriu. The representative
   listened to us for two hours. Then he spoke for thirty minutes.

   <p>Among the things he said was that we go to Sondu and inform the
   affected community of an impending meeting with top Japanese
   officials. We told him of our fears. He guaranteed that he would end
   the harassment in the project area and protect us from further
   arrests.

   <p>Thus it was with joy that I set out December 26 to be the bidder of
   good news to members of the community. I did not have any foreboding
   as I drove from Nairobi for 500 kilometres to the project area.

   <p>At around midday, I was snaking up the dusty road towards a nearby
   shopping centre called Apoko. I offered a lift to three villagers who
   were walking up the hilly and windy 15 kilometres to the shopping
   centre.

   <p>At the centre, one of them informedf he was going acrossd the river,
   another four kilometres, over the bridge built by Konoike. This
   bridge, according to project documents, was meant to benefit members
   of the local community who did not have to spend any more money on the
   ferry operators.

   <p>I was stopped at the bridge by security guards who told me I was
   unwanted in that area and that our project vehicle had been banned
   from using the road. I left the villager to walk across the bridge. I
   turned the vehicle and was flagged down by another villager who
   requested I take him to the shopping district. I obliged.

   <p>The time was 12.30 pm, December 26. As I drove back towards the
   shopping district, about a kilometre from the bridge, a big green
   gravel mixing truck came thundering towards me. On my left was deep
   depression. We drive keeping left. On my right was a mountain wall.
   The vehicle was steered directly towards me. I steered right. The left
   side of my car was hit, the side mirror cluttered into the deep
   ravine. There was dust all over.

   <p>Another vehicle, a van, came behind me and blocked my path.

   <p>Two Konoike security guards emerged from the haze. They were waving
   their walkie-talkies menacingly. I identify one as Charles O. Ogutu
   and another as Mike Gundo. I can identify the rest by sight. All I
   could hear them say was: You are the inciters. Today you will see
   fire 

   <p>That was before I spat out blood when the guards punched me,
   secifically Ogutu, in the mouth. The villager was shocked. He was
   yanked out of the car, beaten and kicked into the depression. I only
   saw his white shirt disappearing beneath me as he rolled over and
   over. It was at that moment that I locked myself in the car and rolled
   up the windows. The Konoike guards stoned the car in a bid to break
   in. They only stopped when they saw villagers appearing over the hills
   with machetes. They radioed for reinforcement.

   <p>At 1.30 pm, five armed policemen appeared with a vehicle. I was still
   sandwiched between the two cars. The police leader ordered me to open
   the doors of the vehicle. Instead, I opened a small section of the
   window. I heard Ogutu urge him to shoot me dead in the car.

   <p>Shoot him c shoot him. Kill him. He has stopped our money from
   coming. Kill him!h That is all I remember hearing.

   <p>I told the policemen to let me know if I was under arrest and to show
   me the arrest warrant. I told him I was afraid to open the window
   further because the Konoike guards had just broken my finger, and I
   did not want them to break another finger. The policeman stepped back
   and talked over his walkie-talkie. Four policemen had surrounded the
   vehicle with their guns cocked.

   <p>I was dehydrating fast because I was confined in the car under the
   sweltering tropical heat.

   <p>At 3.30 pm, more policemen, all armed came. The number I counted rose
   to about 30. The number of villagers was also swelling as word spread
   across the villages about what was happening to me.

   <p>One policeman identified himself as Kola, the Ahero police commander.
   He ordered me to open the doors to the vehicle. I asked him if I was
   under arrest. He said he just wanted to have a word with me. I told
   him we could speak through the small crack because my finger had been
   broken and I was afraid the Konoike guards, who were hovering around,
   would break the other fingers.

   <p>He got angry and declared I was under arrest. He ordered me to open
   the door of the vehicle. I told I would gladly follow the policemen to
   the station but no armed policeman would be allowed to enter inside
   the vehicle as per office regulations.

   <p>I remember him saying: Who do you think you are? You think you are
   gold? I will call a towing vehicle at your own expense!

   <p>The number of armed policemen, machine guns, rifles and pistols, had
   swelled to about 50. The number of villagers had also increased to
   more than 500 people.

   <p>At 6.45 pm the angry villagers started throwing stones towards the
   policemen who fled the scene. I was later told the recovery vehicle
   had just come and was preparing to tow my vehicle. I could not see it
   because I was sandwiched between the two big vehicles. Apparently the
   villagers had vowed that the police would not take me anywhere.

   <p>At 7.15, darkness crept. I am told the villagers were afraid the
   police would use the cover of darkness to harm me. The villagers lit
   three pressure lanterns which illuminated the area very well. They
   settled for a night-long vigil.

   <p>At around 8.30 pm, I heard movement on the left side of my car. Then I
   heard instructions being given. I heard something like Fire in the
   car  if it gets him, too bad! Fire three shots that side and you fire
   the other side.

   <p>Horrified, I opened the passenger side window to tell the police not
   to shoot at the villagers because I surrender. The next thing I saw
   was a black figure with an AK-47 aimed at me. Everything else happened
   in slow motion.

   <p>I could see myself laughing and telling myself I was not meant to die
   this way. Meanwhile, I started dropping down. The floor of the car was
   so far way. And there was a lot of heat on the left side of my body.

   <p>My eyes were clogged with glass. My nose was bleeding, also clogged
   with glass. There was strong smell of metal, I guess gunpowder. I
   could see my head rushing towards one of the Konoike vehicles that had
   blocked my path, the door opened.

   <p>I could see fire flies all over. Except this time the flames were
   ugly. They were red and

   <p>Sparking instead of the beautiful light yellow. I remember assuring
   myself that the villagers would be safe. But I was having difficulty
   breathing because I had been kicked into the floor of the Konoike van
   which was still carrying Mr Ogutu, the Konoike security man. The
   vehicle was being driven too fast and somebody kept punching my ribs
   from the back.

   <p>The police later said they had fired over 100 bullets which I was to
   pay for.

   <p>The Konoike vehicle was stopped 15 kilometres from the site of my
   arrest. Ogutu said he had to kick in two of my teeth. The policemen
   escorting me pleaded with him not to do that because their boss knew
   the condition I was in when I was arrested and they would lose their
   jobs if I arrived in a different condition. He was promised there will
   be enough room to beat me when we reached the Ahero police station.

   <p>I lost track of time at that moment.

   <p>I was kicked into the police station from the van. There I was
   received with blows and kicks by a Mr Otieno, the district criminal
   investigation officer. I was immune to pain at that time. I could not
   see. My hearing was bad. I heard him say I was going to die from my
   bullet wound. That is when I realisedf my T-shirt was glued on the
   left side of my body. It was wet and cold. But I could not see,
   rolling my eyeballs would cause a great deal of pain.

   <p>I was stripped naked and taken to a room where I was told the police
   would plant a letter on me that I was planning to bomb the
   construction site. Otieno and other policemen asked me if I was ready
   to confess that I was the Sondu bomber. I sad no. I was lashed but
   felt no pain because my whole body was throbbing.

   <p>That is when they noticed my broken finger. Somebody grabbed the
   finger and twisted it demanding I confess. Now there was real pain. I
   screamed. The police said as a journalist, I will never type again.
   Somebody punched my wounded shoulder. I screamed again. Somebody
   ordered I stop screaming and start singing a popular local song titled
   Malo! Malo! (Higher! Higher!). I knew the song that night. I sang with
   every stab of pain on my shoulder or finger. I wished they could just
   go on kicking me and punching me and leave the shoulder and finger
   alone.

   <p>I heard Ogutu saying my future was ruined because he was going back
   with a group of police officers to shoot at the men and rape their
   women. Their blood would be in my hands.

   <p>I think at around 1 am, I was thrown in jail. The inmates had been
   ordered to beat me up because I was bringing trouble to the
   government. I landed into more fists and clawing hands the moment I
   was thrown in jail. It was at that moment the inmates noticed my
   dislocated and broken finger. Afraid they had broken the finger, five
   of them pinned me down as one yanked the digit back into place. I
   screamed. A dirty rag was shoved in my mouth to muffle the scream.

   <p>Then they noticed my eyeful of glassses. I was pinned down again and
   another licked the eyeballs, spitting in the sloth bucket all the
   time. Because I did not want the rag shoved in my mouth, I screamed
   inwardly.

   <p>I am nursing horrible thrashes and wounds on the lips.

   <p>But I was glad for what they did. They then peeled off my shirt to
   inspect the bullet wound. One of them produced a colgate toothpaste
   which was smeared over the wound so that it dries over the wound.

   <p>Then they demanded to be told what I had done.

   <p>The next day, I was ordered to empty the full sloth bucket. Naked,
   bare feet, I walked into a filthy toilet, now half blind, where I
   emptied the sloth bucket. Later in the day, I was summoned from the
   cell block. I was informed I was going to sing again.

   <p>I sang amid pain and torture. This time I saw Otieno, the
   investigating officer, making orders for my beating. Suddenly, all the
   police stopped beating me and saluted. At the door was a senior
   intelligence officer ? the people who report directly to State House
   and the president. I was taken to another room where this man, he is
   kind, interrogated me for four hours. He did not beat me. He asked
   such questions like preferred sex position.

   <p>This is also the day the beating officially stopped. The station
   commander, Kola, however kept on reminding me that he was yet to give
   me 10 strokes of the cane. My request to be seen by a doctor were
   turned down. My request for my clothes were turned down. I was only
   given my jeans trouser.

   <p>Came December 28 and we were close to 100 people in the cell. Water
   was brought in a bucket to wipe the floor. The hardcore inmates used
   it to bath before assigning people duty to wipe the floor of the lice
   infested jail.

   <p>Came the 29^th and I was in the privileged circle. I was allowed to
   bath with the dirty water and wipe myself with soap. Other prisoners
   merely looked on enviously.

   <p>This was the same day I was removed from Ahero in a hide and seek game
   between the police and my lawyer. I was moved 30 kilometeres away to
   the Kisumu jail, kept incomunicado before being transferred 50
   kilometres away to Maseno.

   <p>Again I was denied the opportunity to see a doctor, to bath or to sit
   in the sun. I spent 30^th, 31^st and January 1, 2000 with nobody
   knowing my whereabouts. I was not tortured at Maseno. I would just
   drift into sleep, back into wakefulness and back into sleep. I lost a
   lot of weight for lack of water.

   <p>It was then on December 2, that I was produced in court, injured,
   wounded and beaten, charged with resisting arrest, incitement to
   violence, tresspass and taking photographs and publishing false
   information to Japan.

   <p>What lesson did I learn from all this punishment as I painfully
   reflect on what happened to me? That the will of the people of
   Sondu-Miriu shall prevail!
