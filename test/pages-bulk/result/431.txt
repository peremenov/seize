   I made and served this at a dinner party tonight. This was the first
   time that I made a "prime rib". I did follow the procedure in the TV
   program by purchasing a 4 rib "choice" standing rib roast and had my
   butcher cut off the bones. Instead of using a pot to cover the roast I
   placed a stone baking sheet both below and above the roast in the
   oven. I also cooked this a bit longer, removing from the oven at 120,
   letting stand until 130, then taking into the crusting stage. I cut
   and served the roast once it was past 145. I served this with Alton's
   garlic mashed potatoes and Emeril's horseradish cream sauce as well as
   the sage sauce. Again a wonderful dinner for 5 adults and 5 children.
   I will make this one again.
   <h>All I Can Say is WOW

   It took me several days to find the right pot, but in the end it was
   the most fantastic piece of meat. It was my first attempt at a large
   piece of meat (10 pounds). I was a little worried in the beginning
   about the temp not rising fast enough but at almost exactly 4 hours,
   the digital temp was 118. I pulled it out, took off the lid and
   covered with foil. About 25 minutes later, the alarm went off on the
   thermometer at 130. The rest is history. Talk about fantastic. My
   Christmas dinner was a great success. Thank you sir.
   <h>It's a Wonderful Roast

   Slow cooking the roast, after the aging, made it juicy and wonderful.
   It would be helpful, though, to have an idea of how many minutes per
   pound to allow for cooking. Our dinner was delayed because I hadn't
   timed it properly! If that were available, I'd give it 5 stars.
   <h>Tasted fabulous - although a bit on the rare side.
   
   <p>User: CHRISTINA from Los Angeles, CA    User Rating: 5 stars
   I thought this prime rib tasted great. It was juicy and flavorful, and
   best of all - easy! The only issue that I have with the recipe
   concerns that cooking temp/time. After taking the roast out of the
   oven when it reaches 118 degrees, how is it supposed to reach 130
   degrees? I understand that the foil will contain the heat and continue
   the cooking process, however how is it supposed to actually increase
   the temperature??? I think this had something to do with the extreme
   rareness of the roast, so I'm wondering what others may have
   differently? (I happen to love rare beef, but some of my guests
   unfortunately didn't.) Just wondering, how crucial do you think the
   clay pot is? The ease of this recipe is slightly affected by having to
   lug a fairly heavy terra cotta pot into the oven.
   <h>A couple of Observations
   
   <p>User: JANE from Atlanta, GA    User Rating: 5 stars
   My first time with this recipe, but I got raves for Christmas dinner.
   Here is an observation on the heat to help the next cook: 1) Since I
   cook on a vintage 1936 Magic Chef, I used both an electronic oven temp
   gauge and a meat thermometer. Even though I kept the oven temp turned
   to the required 200 degrees, the oven temp was registering at 300
   degrees -- probably due to the clay pot holding heat. This meant that
   the meat cooked a lot faster than I expected. Don't know if this is
   "right" or not, but the end result was fantastic, so it probably
   doesn't matter. 2) I expected the roast to end up medium rare, but it
   was very rare, even though I followed the temps exactly. This seems to
   be the experience of some of the other cooks here. I'm going to try it
   again and see what happens.

   We loved the final roast, but it took some swift heating to get it
   done after 4 hours in the clay pot...and it was raw!!! We aged the
   meat to perfection but when it came to the cooking instructions was
   something amiss? Has anyone else had a problem with the temperature??

   <p>User: Anonymous    User Rating: 5 stars
   I cooked the meat to 130 degrees, let it rest for about 10 minutes
   while oven heated to 500 degrees. Then I cooked it to internal temp of
   145 degrees for a medium rare/medium roast. It was perfect! I might
   cook it to 125 & 140 degrees next time for more of a medium rare
   finished product. I have been cooking rib roast every Christmas for 6
   years and this was the best one yet for nice crisp crust. Also, very
   few juices in the pan - all were in the meat!
   <h>Good Prime Rib

   I skipped the dry aging and planter processes. I just followed the
   temperatures of the oven and meat temps. I put the roast in at 10:30
   and it was done by 3:30 (if that helps with timing) using a 3 bone
   roast. It turned out perfectly medium rare throughout. I made an Au
   Jus without the pan drippings (1 cup of wine, 2 cups of beef stock,
   salt and pepper) and it tasted fine without the drippings.

   <h>"Aged" was right...but not for the beef!
   <p>User: David from Chandler, AZ    User Rating: 4 stars
   The results were delicious, but the roast took FOREVER! I finally gave
   up after more than 8 hours. I wanted the beef medium (rather than
   medium rare). It took almost 7 hours to get to 118; I finally took it
   out of the oven at about 130. After its final crusting, it eventually
   reached 145, which was perfect for my taste--still quite pink, but not
   red. I'm not sure why it took so long: was the clay pot I was using
   too heavy? Was the roast too cold (it essentially went from the fridge
   into the oven, and the thermometer started out at 32 degrees!)? The
   pot I used had a dark interior--was that the problem? The roast was
   tied--did that affect the cooking time? We were quite pleased with the
   texture, taste, and appearance of the finished roast, but Christmas
   dinner after 9 p.m. was NOT part of the plan! Next time I make this
   (and I will make it again), I will bring the roast to room temp before
   putting it in the oven, and I will probably dispense with the clay
   pot.
   <h>What a surprise

   I was really unsure of the dry aging thing, convinced I was going to
   poison us, but I followed this exactly and I stunned my own self with
   how utterly perfect this roast turned out. My people went crazy for
   it. It was perfectly rare, almost fork tender and absolutely juicy. I
   had no leftovers! They even ate the bones! Alton, I should never have
   doubted you. You made my Christmas dinner the best ever and I got all
   the kudos!

   This is some awesome prime rib, and really not hard to do at all. And
   don't let the dry aging thing scare you, it's easy and makes a big
   difference in the end result. I deviated a little by heating the roast
   to 127 F before pulling it out of the pot (which took about 5 hours).
   After the high heat sear and a 40 min rest, it turned out a perfect
   medium rare. I could only find a 14" azalea pot in my area...which
   makes a big difference when you're trying to find a baking dish that
   will fit underneath. I ended up buying a inexpensive 12" stainless
   steel skillet and sawing the handle off...which fit perfectly. It also
   worked well when making the jus afterwards. But yeah, make this and
   your "kitchen timid" friends will think you're a master chef =)
   <h>Best rib roast I ever cooked
   <p>User: JANET from Bergenfield, NJ    User Rating: 5 stars
   I have to admit, I'm not a huge fan of Alton. A few weeks ago, we
   happened to catch this episode. We watched it because I always cook
   rib roast for Christmas. The past few years, I have cooked it at low
   heat using a slightly different recipe. It was definitely better than
   the higher heat method. But we had never aged the meat or crisped it
   at the end. I only aged it 2 days. I didn't do the clay pot -- just my
   roasting pan. Hands down, this was the best rib roast I have ever
   cooked. After reading all the reviews here, I left it in to 125?
   instead of the 118. Then let it rest to a little over 130. Then I
   crisped it. The roast was done to perfection. Absolutely fabulous.
   This recipe is a winner! I will never cook it any other way.

   The most succulent christmas roast I have EVER had. This ranks right

   single piece of meat for Christmas dinner - afraid I would ruin it. I
   have now done this recipe 3 years in a row and it never fails to
   impress. With the right tools and a bit of preparation you cannot mess
   this one up.

   <h>Question?
   <p>User: Stephanie from Andover, MN    User Rating: 5 stars
   When the roast goes back in for a crisping at 500 degrees, is it
   covered with the pot or foil or nothing at all? How long does this
   roast take on average for a say an 8 lb roast? Just got my clay pot
   and I want to try this for Xmas this year, but don't want to mess up
   and need to know a ballpark time to plan dinner! This will be my first
   attempt at a rib roast.

   Growing up with a chef dad, I never thought I'd be able to top his
   holiday roast. That belief was shattered when I served this roast last
   year. My family is still talking about how delicious and flavorful it
   was. Prep time - if you have limited fridge space, it may be a bit
   inconvenient. Digital probe thermometer - the one I have is good in
   terms of functionality, but can be technically challenging. Just make
   sure you take the time to read the directions over before delving into
   the project. If you do not have this set properly, it will mean the
   end of your meal.

   I used a 2 rib roast instead of a 4 rib. I think b/c the roast was
   smaller, it didn't carry over as much heat. I took the roast out at
   118 degrees, but it only carried over to 125. Next time I use a
   smaller roast, I'll probably let it go to about 123 degrees before
   taking it out of the oven. I also used a roast that was already dry
   aged (can't beat the NYC butcher shops), so not too much moisture came
   out of it in the fridge. All in all - outstanding...even without the
   flower pot. Probe therometer is a must!

   You may need to adjust the temps though. Instead of pulling out the
   roast at 118 I pulled it out at 125 and it only heated to 129 and
   stopped. I blasted at 500 for about 18 minutes. When I took it out I
   took the temperature and it got up to 150. The center cuts were pretty
   rare. I liked it that way but next time I'll keep it in the oven at
   200 until it gets up to 130 degrees. I made the Au Juise and it was
   great I also used the fat to make Yorkshire Pudding which was a great
   side dish for this meal. Then I used the bones and made beef soup.
   Today I had a prime rib sandwich on an onion roll for lunch. This cut
   of meat may be expensive but I was able to make so many things out of.
   Best of all the kids asked for thirds!!

   I have used this recipe before, and with trying a few variations. It
   all goes back to the original when you want a flawless and tasty prime
   rib. When using this recipe, don't skimp on using a lower and cheaper
   cut, as it will taste this way in the end. Also using a GOOD RED wine
   makes all the difference in the world when it comes to the Au Jus. I
   have to say that this is probably the best prime rib recipe that I

   I have followed the directions from AB except that I used a five bone
   roast that I had removed from a whole rack; I also increased to 5
   days. I need to stress that changing of the paper towels is really
   important as is putting towels under the rack and changing them every
   day! The sage leaves add a great flavor to the sauce. When I carve, I
   remove the bones from the meat to enjoy the next day.

   Absolutely a fantastic recipe. The best rib roast I've ever had,
   including some top notch steakhouses. A few things to consider,
   though. Firstly, the clay pot is not strictly necessary, but the even
   heat from all sides ensures the meat all gets done at the same time.
   This is the real strength of this recipe...uniform doneness all the
   way through, top to bottom, side to side. In higher temp recipes, the
   outer ring of filet meat(which is the best part) is always way
   overdone. With this recipe it was perfectly medium rare with a small
   1/4 inch layer that was more done from the browning process. Be
   warned, though, carry-over temp varies with the size of the roast. The
   smaller it is, the less it will carry over.

   Following these instructions for dry aging beef produced the best
   results I've ever had. Even a mundane supermarket rib roast tastes
   incredible after 3 days of dry aging a la Alton Brown (it works with
   any cut of beef.) This slow roasted rib roast was the best roast I've
   ever made - and I've been an avid home cook for 25 years. Alton,
   you're the best!

   <h>Most Excellent Rib Roast Recipe
   <p>User: ROGER from Castle Rock, CO    User Rating: 5 stars
   I tried this recipe on my BBQ, using the recommended rub and following
   the cooking instructions after "dry aging" for 72 hours. It was a
   tight fit using the pot and saucer in the BBQ, but well worth it.
   Also, cooking it at a low temp, letting it stand, then finishing off
   at 500 degrees kept it moist. most awesome rib roast yet.

   I have made this at least 6 times now and it comes out perfect
   everytime. I actually bought a terra cotta planter and base that just
   fits in my oven to cook it. It is a pain, but it makes the best roast.
   I have adjusted the cooking times a bit because we live in a high
   altitude area. This is the meal my dad asks for when it is birthday,
   anniversary and any time he can get me to make it for him. Just add
   sweet creamed corn, scallopped potatoes and asparagus and you are set.

   I was scared to leave the high priced meat open in the fidge to dry
   age, but patience eliminated my fear. Caution with the high heat at
   the end of this cooking. Any "stuff in the oven will burn off and set
   off the smoke detector. ( A great opportunity to have a family fire
   drill and a great meal afterwards.) You must try this recipe.

   <p>User: Mike from Knoxville, TN    User Rating: 5 stars
   This is a great recipe. It is easy and has quickly become a family
   favorite. The low heat cooking method results in a very evenly cooked
   roast. Wonderful if you love your roast beef rare. Don't be scared off
   by the "Terra Cotta pot". It makes sense if you have seen the show
   (remember this is Alton Brown). It works very well in a pyrex dish
   covered with foil. I have had somewhat inconsistant results with the
   au jus. It can be a little salty from all the salt on the roast. It
   depends how much falls into the pan during the cooking process. I have
   also "exploded" a pyrex dish on my range while deglazing. Ooops. Make
   sure you heat it evenly.
   <h>even without the azalea pot...

   Follow the rest of the drill...I've done a couple of 4-ribs and a
   7-rib. Same drill for all sizes, shapes. It may be the best rib roast
   you've had in your entire life...it will be medium rare-ish, though,
   deal with it...age it for 4-6 days if you can. It gets funky looking,
   but you will not believe the whole dang thing when you taste it. You
   will finally understand WHY you have taste buds. The sage au jus is
   easy/excellent.
   <h>Good for pork too

   I didn't have a clay pot, but the rib roast still turned out great. I
   also cooked a cheap pork roast in the same manner (low, then high) and
   it was even more popular than the roast. Go figure. Like some of the
   other reviews, a better time estimate would've been helpful, but I was
   real lucky and both roasts were perfect doneness
   <h>Christmas Rib Roast
   <p>User: ANDREW from mn, MN    User Rating: 5 stars
   This is a fantastic recipe for cooking a great holiday meal. It is now
   a tradition for our family to buy a good sized rib roast (we go with a
   six bone roast) and to cook this with a whole smattering of side
   dishes. The meat is always flavorful and tender. It has a slightly
   peppery and salty quality that pervades the whole roast, but not
   enough to alter the natural flavor of the meat, just to draw out it's
   inherent flavors. The roast comes out with a nice medium well slice on
   either end of the roast and succulent rare slices in the center, truly
   a phenomenal thing for famlies that have differeing tastes on
   doneness. Excellent meal, bar none.

   real prime piece of meat from the butcher! I did a beef broth
   reduction w/a touch of cognac for the au jus. And for a super horsey
   sauce: sour cream, horseradish and blue cheese crumbles! Thanks AB! I
   will never doubt you again! Brined turkey and aged rib roast ROCK!

   I timed Christmas dinner wrong and had to dramatically raise the

   As a chef I am always looking for something new. I thought this
   recepie sounded great but I found the end result to be a little tough.
   I mean it was ok but nothing special. I followed the recepi exactly
   and used a cut of black angus choice. The meat looked great when
   finish, pink though-out but was a little chewy. I have always learned
   with expensive cuts of meat you need to use higher heat.
   <h>Good Taste Takes a lot longer
   <p>User: Andrew from Lincoln, NE    User Rating: 4 stars
   I have wanted to try this for some time now and finally did. Couldnt
   find the planter as most stores around here dont carry that thing in
   winter. Anyway I only had time to dry age for a little over 2 days.
   You have to be trusting as the meat starts to look scary. When it was
   finally time to cook I let it stand out for about an hour and a half
   (something they always talk about but didnt have in the recipe). Put
   in the oven @ 200 and waited.... and waited.. and waited. I think it
   must cook faster with the planter as it took about 5 hrs to hit 118. I
   pulled the meat out and it was so cool that the temp didnt rise at
   all. I put the roast back in at 225 and set the alarm for 125. This
   took about another hour to reach, much to the dismay of my now very
   hungry guests. Once this temp was reached I pulled the roast and
   covered, then started the wine reduction. This step takes longer than
   I thought (about 45 minutes), for something that, in my opinion,
   tastes very bad. I guess I dont like the taste of Sage, but everyone
   is different. When i cut the meat though, I was very pleased to find
   it very flavorful with great texture, and this is only 2 days dry
   aging, next time I will go the 3 days or more. Over all it was good
   but if you dont have the planter plan on about 6 to 7 hrs of cook/
   prep time. Also I would take to roast to at least 120 or more the meat
   was still a nice mid rare and didnt coast to much over 130 (134 I
   think).

   I actually cooked the meat completely differently (in a rotisserie),
   but used the aging process in this recipe. It turned out FABULOUS! I
   have a mortal, almost irrational fear of food contimination/poisoning,
   but if you stick to his temp/moisture guidlines, you'll be fine. I
   actually aged the beef for almost 5 days and it turned out perfect.
   Cooked perfectly through as well!

   <p>User: DARREN from Salem, OR    User Rating: 4 stars
   I love good juicy pink beef, but the temps given on the show were a
   bit on the rare side. If you will have guests that like beef on the
   medium or done side add another ten degrees to what he recommends on
   the show. I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was to
   absolutely die for but, my wife likes her beef "done" and even the
   outer cuts were not acceptable to her. It all depends on your guests
   however and this recipe absolutely kicks behind if you're a prime rib
   fan. Use the clay pot, it does make a difference with the crust at the
   end.

   Christmas Day Dinner was looking a little bleak, we were all very
   tired of Turkey and Ham. So, I decided to try my favorite meal. Never
   having attemped to make a Standing Rib Roast, I was a little
   intimidated and cost factors also played a big part of my hesitance.
   But watching Alton do anything gives the confidence needed to proceed
   any task. I followed his instuction perfectly, however I could not
   locate the clay cover. I continued without it, and it turned out to be
   the BEST PRIME RIB ever!!!! All of my family raved, we now have a new
   tradition. Not only did we enjoy the leftovers as French Dips, I made
   a chili using the bones and tiny bit left. If you are looking for the
   perfect recipe look no further... Thanks for this website, Robin LV NV

   You would think that making a standing rib roast would be diffiuclt,

   200.

   I've had horrible results with standing rib roasts several times in
   the past and was largely discouraged by the tough and fatty results
   and the total waste of money. On pure faith in dear Alton I tried it
   again this year. I purchased a grocery-store choice cut of meat (to
   minimize my losses if it was another bomb--faith only goes so far). My
   local Home Depot supplied the appropriate pottery, and my cooler
   drawer in my fridge did the aging. (I was nervous, afraid I'd end up
   with a rotten piece of meat.) Let me tell you, this roast rivaled the
   local 4-star restaurants. Alton, you are wonderful! And to the person
   who asked if the pottery is necessary because it's inconvenient: yes,
   it's necessary, and if you want convenience you can get pre-cooked rib
   roast slices at your local Costco!

   I was horrified to try the aging after what I paid for the roast (fear

   oven didn't need it. The wonderful part is that it was the same pink
   color from the outside in, and every slice looked better than the one
   previous. This was simply grand!

   I found the reviews extremely helpfull. the mistake I made was in not
   knowing temps and doneness. I went for 147 degrees and wound up with
   well done. I also could not get the meat temp. to rise out of the
   oven. I recommend not waiting more than 20 minutes and then placing
   back in the oven at the 500 degree setting until hitting the temp and
   doneness that you like. I also enjoyed and endorse the link to
   Emeralds Horseradish sauce. My family loved it. I also like Alton's
   idea of saving the bones for a late night snake for the Cook
