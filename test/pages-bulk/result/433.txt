   Eye On Stocks For Thursday, Jan. 20

   <p>Despite a rise in listings for novelty food items, shares of
   eBay fell hard in extended trading after
   the Internet auction giant projected 2005 earnings and revenue below
   Wall Street estimates. The stock was seen down more than 12 points in
   after-hours trading. Investors were disappointed with eBay's 2005
   earnings guidance of $1.48 to $1.52 per share and net revenue of $4.25
   billion to $4.35 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson First Call
   expected 2005 earnings of $1.61 per share and revenue of $4.37
   billion. EBay also missed the fourth-quarter earnings estimate by a
   penny, reporting income of 33 cents per share, while revenue was
   in-line at $934 million. Fourth-quarter listings totaled 404.6
   million, eBay said, compared with an estimate of 406 million by Credit
   Suisse First Boston. In addition, as predicted by some Wall Street
   analysts, eBay also announced a two-for-one stock split set for Feb.
   16 to shareholders of record Jan. 31.
   <p>Qualcomm fell 6% in the after-hours session
   on disappointing second-quarter guidance. The wireless company
   announced fiscal first-quarter earnings of 28 cents per share and
   revenue of $1.39 billion, compared with the analysts' consensus
   estimate of 27 cents per share and $1.402 billion. Qualcomm said it
   expects second-quarter adjusted earnings to range from 25 cents per
   share to 27 cents per share, below the Street estimate of 30 cents.
   Last week, CSFB maintained a "neutral" rating and $42.50 target price
   on Qualcomm. In our view, the current share price is already
   discounting optimistic 3G scenarios in Europe, China and North America
   and we continue to believe upside remains limited over the next six to
   12 months," CSFB said. "We would look for evidence of improved
   emerging markets momentum or more aggressive WCDMA pricing by European
   operators to become more constructive in 2005."
   <p>AT&T will report fourth-quarter results tomorrow
   morning. The telecom services giant is expected to report earnings of
   58 cents per share and revenue of $7.15 billion, compared with
   year-ago earnings of 43 cents and $8.01 billion. Earlier today, Morgan
   Stanley said quarterly earnings "will likely be a study in
   contradictions." AT&T is facing double-digit revenue declines, the
   research firm said, but could top consensus earnings expectations "due
   to aggressive cost cutting." Morgan Stanley, which maintained an
   "underweight" rating for AT&T, expects conservative 2005 guidance
   given uncertainties in the telecom industry.
   <p>Macromedia reported third-quarter earnings
   in-line with the consensus but shares rose almost 5% in after-hours
   trading on the software firm's bullish fourth-quarter outlook.
   Macromedia reported quarterly earnings of 21 cents per share and
   revenue of $108.6 million, compared with analysts' forecast of 21
   cents and $107 million. Fourth-quarter revenue is expected to range
   from $108 million to $113 million, compared with the Street estimate
   of $108 million. In addition, Macromedia, the developer of Flash
   technology, announced the appointment of Stephen Elop as chief
   executive. Previously Macromedia's chief operating officer, Elop takes
   over for Rob Burgess, who will retain his role as board chairman.
   <p>Symantec announced third-quarter earnings
   above consensus estimates. The security software firm reported
   quarterly income of 24 cents per share and revenue of $695 million,
   compared with analysts' forecasts of 22 cents per share and $665
   million. The company also guided fourth-quarter and 2005 earnings and
   revenue guidance slightly above expectations. Symantec announced in
   December its intention to acquire Veritas Software(nasdaq:VRTS -news
   -people) for approximately $13.5 billion. Earlier this month, JP
   Morgan upgraded Symantec to "overweight" from "neutral" and said
   shares (then trading below $24) were at an attractive entry point. "We
   have liked the idea of the Veritas deal for Symantec's long-term, but
   have been waiting for a better valuation entry point to give us
   comfort accepting the headline risk of Microsoft entering the AV
   (antivirus) market in the second half of 2005, and the integration of
   two large software companies," it said. "We now believe we have
   reached an attractive level where we believe the upside is much better
   than the downside."
