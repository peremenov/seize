   <h>A Normal Country
   Andrei Shleifer and Daniel Treisman
   From Foreign Affairs, March/April 2004


   <p>Summary:  Conventional wisdom in the West says that post-Cold War
   Russia has been a disastrous failure. The facts say otherwise. Aspects
   of Russia's performance over the last decade may have been
   disappointing, but the notion that the country has gone through an
   economic cataclysm and political relapse is wrong--more a comment on
   overblown expectations than on Russia's actual experience. Compared to
   other countries at a similar level of economic and political
   development, Russia looks more the norm than the exception.

   <h>DOWN, NOT OUT

   <p>Almost everyone believes that Russia's economy contracted
   catastrophically in the 1990s. A report prepared for the British House
   of Commons in 1998, for example, claimed that living standards in
   Russia had "fallen to levels not experienced since the immediate
   post-war years." According to Goskomstat, the state-controlled body
   that publishes Russia's official statistics, Russian GDP per capita
   fell about 24 percent in real terms between 1991 (when Mikhail
   Gorbachev left office) and 2001 (one year into Putin's presidency).
   From 1991 to 1998, before the recovery, it had dropped by 39 percent.

   <p>Yet there are three reasons to think that Russia's economic
   performance in the 1990s was actually better than these figures
   suggest. First, much of the Soviet Union's output consisted of
   military goods, unfinished construction projects, and shoddy consumer
   products, for which there was little or no demand after 1991. Under a
   market system, firms no longer had a reason to produce goods they
   could not sell. Although reducing wasteful production lowered GDP
   figures in the short run, it improved the overall efficiency of the
   Russian economy. Under the Soviet system, moreover, managers routinely
   inflated their production figures to obtain increased bonuses. With
   the end of central planning, managers wished to underreport output so
   as to reduce their tax bills. Thus Russia's pre-reform output was
   probably substantially lower than officially reported, and its
   subsequent decline correspondingly smaller.

   <p>Second, Russia's unofficial economy grew rapidly in the 1990s.
   Estimating the scale of unofficial activity is difficult, but (since
   even underground firms require power) one technique to measure the
   whole economy's output is to use electricity consumption. The figure
   below shows the trend in official real GDP between 1990 and 2001 along
   with figures for electricity consumption. Although official GDP fell
   29 percent during this period, electricity consumption fell only about
   19 percent, suggesting that Russia's decline in output was not as
   sharp as indicated by the official statistics. Since firms are likely
   to use electricity more sparingly under market conditions, the decline
   in electricity consumption probably still overstates the real drop in
   output.

   <p>Third, other statistics suggest that average living standards fell
   less dramatically, or even improved, during the 1990s. Goskomstat's
   figures for final household consumption, for example, fell just 4
   percent (in constant prices) between 1990 and 2001. Retail trade
   actually rose 4 percent between 1990 and 2001. And average living
   space per person rose from 16 square meters in 1990 to 19 square
   meters in 2000. The shares of households with radios, televisions,
   tape recorders, refrigerators, washing machines, and electric vacuum
   cleaners all increased between 1991 and 2000. And private ownership of
   cars doubled, rising from 14 cars per 100 households in 1991 to 27
   cars per 100 households in 2000. The number of Russians going abroad
   as tourists rose from 1.6 million in 1993 to 4.3 million in 2000.

   <p>Russia has, without doubt, experienced an increase in inequality, in
   both income and consumption. But indicators suggest that there has
   been improvement even at the bottom of the social pyramid. Since 1993
   (the first year for which comprehensive figures exist), the percentage
   of Russia's housing with running water has increased from 66 percent
   to 73 percent; the share with hot water from 51 to 59 percent; and the
   percentage with central heating from 64 percent to 73 percent. Since
   1990, the proportion of Russian apartments with telephones has
   increased from 30 percent to 49 percent.

   <p>A closer look at the figure above also casts doubt on some common
   arguments about Russia's recession. A popular theory holds that
   Russia's economic decline was caused by certain misguided government
   policies pursued in the 1990s. Particularly damaging, so the argument
   goes, were Yeltsin's privatization program and his "loans for shares"
   scheme. The privatization program, implemented between 1993 and 1994,
   transferred shares in most firms from the government to managers,
   workers, and the public. This meant that by mid-1994, almost 70
   percent of the Russian economy was in private hands. The loans for
   shares scheme, inaugurated in 1995, provided for the transfer of
   shares in a few state-owned natural resource enterprises to major
   businessmen in exchange for loans to the government. It accelerated
   the consolidation of a few large financial groups, led by the
   so-called oligarchs, who subsequently enjoyed great political and
   economic influence.

  <p> However, as the figure makes clear, the effects of privatization and
   loans for shares could not have caused Russia's economic contraction.
   Most of the fall in both official GDP and electricity consumption
   occurred prior to 1994, before the significant part of the mass
   privatization program was completed and the loans for shares program
   was even contemplated. After 1994 -- when the effects of privatization
   could be felt -- Russia's economic decline actually slowed, with rapid
   growth starting in 1999.

   <p>Comparing Russia's performance in the 1990s to that of other
   postcommunist countries further weakens the claim that Russia's
   economic malaise was exceptional. Officially measured output fell in
   all the postcommunist economies of eastern Europe and the former
   Soviet Union. It declined in new democracies, such as Russia and
   Poland; in continuing dictatorships, such as Belarus and Tajikistan;
   in rapid reformers, such as the Czech Republic and Hungary; and in
   very slow reformers, such as Ukraine and Uzbekistan. The universality
   of the contraction suggests a common cause. One possibility is the
   decrease in military and economically useless activities that were
   previously counted as output. A second possibility is the temporary
   dislocation that all countries experienced as their planning systems
   disintegrated. Consistent with both these explanations, officially
   measured output began to recover almost everywhere after a few years.

   <p>The patterns of relative decline in the postcommunist countries
   challenge another common theory about Russia's output contraction.
   Some argue that excessively speedy reform exacerbated the decline and
   compare the "gradualism" of China's economic policies favorably with
   the "shock therapy" of Russia's. In fact, there is no obvious
   relationship between speed of reform and change in official output
   among the east European and former Soviet countries. The group of
   countries that contracted least, according to the official figures,
   includes both rapid reformers (such as Estonia, Poland, and the Czech
   Republic) and slow or nonreformers (such as Belarus and Uzbekistan).
   Those with the largest declines also include both nonreformers
   (Tajikistan, Turkmenistan) and some that tried to reform (Moldova).
