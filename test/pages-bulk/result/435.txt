   <h>Did North Korea Cheat?
   Selig S. Harrison
   From Foreign Affairs, January/February 2005

  

   <p>Summary:  Two years ago, Washington accused Pyongyang of running a
   secret nuclear weapons program. But how much evidence was there to
   back up the charge? A review of the facts shows that the Bush
   administration misrepresented and distorted the data--while ignoring
   the one real threat North Korea actually poses.

     <p>Selig S. Harrison is Director of the Asia Program and Chairman of
   the Task Force on U.S. Korea Policy at the Center for International
   Policy. He is also a Senior Scholar at the Woodrow Wilson
   International Center for Scholars and the author of Korean Endgame.

                                                    

   <h>WEAPONS OF MASS DISTRACTION

   <p>On October 4, 2002, the United States suddenly confronted North Korea
   with a damning accusation: that it was secretly developing a program
   to enrich uranium to weapons grade, in violation of the 1994 agreement
   that Pyongyang had signed with Washington to freeze its pursuit of
   nuclear weapons. Since North Korea had cheated, the Bush
   administration declared, the United States was no longer bound by its
   side of the deal. Accordingly, on November 14, 2002, the United States
   and its allies suspended the oil shipments they had been providing
   North Korea under the 1994 agreement. Pyongyang retaliated by
   expelling international inspectors and resuming the reprocessing of
   plutonium, which it had stopped under the 1994 accord (known as the
   Agreed Framework). The confrontation between North Korea and the
   United States once more reached a crisis level

   <p>Much has been written about the North Korean nuclear danger, but one
   crucial issue has been ignored: just how much credible evidence is
   there to back up Washington's uranium accusation? Although it is now
   widely recognized that the Bush administration misrepresented and
   distorted the intelligence data it used to justify the invasion of
   Iraq, most observers have accepted at face value the assessments the
   administration has used to reverse the previously established U.S.
   policy toward North Korea.

   <p>But what if those assessments were exaggerated and blurred the
   important distinction between weapons-grade uranium enrichment (which
   would clearly violate the 1994 Agreed Framework) and lower levels of
   enrichment (which were technically forbidden by the 1994 accord but
   are permitted by the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] and do not
   produce uranium suitable for nuclear weapons)?

   <p>A review of the available evidence suggests that this is just what
   happened. Relying on sketchy data, the Bush administration presented a
   worst-case scenario as an incontrovertible truth and distorted its
   intelligence on North Korea (much as it did on Iraq), seriously
   exaggerating the danger that Pyongyang is secretly making
   uranium-based nuclear weapons. This failure to distinguish between
   civilian and military uranium-enrichment capabilities has greatly
   complicated what would, in any case, have been difficult negotiations
   to end all existing North Korean nuclear weapons programs and to
   prevent any future efforts through rigorous inspection. On June 24,
   2004, the United States proposed a new, detailed denuclearization
   agreement with North Korea at six-party negotiations (including the
   United States, China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, and North Korea) in
   Beijing. Before discussions could even start, however, the Bush
   administration insisted that North Korea first admit to the existence
   of the alleged uranium-enrichment facilities and specify where they
   are located. Pyongyang has so far refused to confirm or deny whether
   it has such facilities; predictably, the U.S. precondition has
   precluded any new talks.

   <p>If it turns out that North Korea did not cheat after all, the
   prospects for a new denuclearization agreement would improve, because
   the Bush administration could no longer argue that Pyongyang is an
   inherently untrustworthy negotiating partner. At any rate, to break
   the diplomatic deadlock, the United States urgently needs a new
   strategy. Washington should deal first with the very real and
   immediate threat posed by the extant stockpile of weapons-usable
   plutonium that Pyongyang has reprocessed since the breakdown of the
   Agreed Framework. Measures to locate and eliminate any enrichment
   facilities that can produce weapons-grade uranium are essential but
   should come in the final stages of a step-by-step denuclearization
   process. Above all, Washington must not once more become embroiled in
   a military conflict on the basis of a worst-case assessment built on
   limited, inconclusive intelligence. There is a real danger that
   military and other pressures on North Korea, designed to bolster a
   failing diplomatic process, could escalate into a full-scale war that
   none of North Korea's neighbors would support.

   <h>INCONVENIENT FACTS

   <p>Washington's accusation of Pyongyang was delivered during a visit to
   the North Korean capital by James Kelly, assistant secretary of state
   for East Asian and Pacific affairs. Kelly told a key North Korean
   official that he had evidence of a uranium-enrichment project.
   According to Kelly, the North Korean official, First Deputy Foreign
   Minister Kang Sok Ju, acknowledged the existence of such a program at
   the time. But Kang has subsequently denied this; what he actually told
   Kelly, according to Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun, was deliberately
   ambiguous: that North Korea is "entitled" to have such a program or
   "an even more powerful one" to deter a pre-emptive U.S. attack.
   According to Paek, Kang also stated that North Korea is entitled to
   pursue an "ncnd" (neither confirm nor deny) policy concerning the
   specifics of its nuclear capabilities, just as the United States
   does--especially since the two countries remain belligerents in the
   technically unfinished Korean War.

   <p>Kelly's confrontation with Kang seems to have been inspired by the
   growing alarm felt in Washington in the preceding five months over the
   ever more conciliatory approach that Seoul and Tokyo had been taking
   toward Pyongyang; by raising the uranium issue, the Bush
   administration hoped to scare Japan and South Korea into reversing
   their policies. The chain of events leading to the confrontation began
   in April 2002, when the two Koreas decided to move ahead with plans
   for North-South railroad links and for the development of a new
   industrial zone at Kaesong in North Korea, where some 1,000 South
   Korean firms were expected to establish factories. These steps
   required U.S. approval to de-mine the demilitarized zone. The United
   States strongly resisted the thaw, refused to approve the de-mining,
   and threatened to block the Kaesong project by restricting the use of
   U.S.-licensed and other sensitive technology by companies investing in
   the zone. (U.S.-South Korean tensions over the technology issue have
   since intensified.) But in August 2002, South Korea's then president,
   Kim Dae Jung, personally appealed to President George W. Bush to drop
   his objections, and on September 12, after an intense diplomatic
   struggle, the Pentagon reluctantly gave the go-ahead for de-mining.
