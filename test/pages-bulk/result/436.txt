    <h>FRANKLIN ELECTRONIC PUBLISHERS, INC. Putting a World of Knowledge in
                                 Your Hand

   <p>Franklin Electronic Publishers, Inc. (NYSE:FEP), the originator of the
   handheld electronic reference product, continues to put a world of
   knowledge and increased value in its users' hands in a wider variety
   of formats and in newer, friendlier, yet more sophisticated platforms.

   <p>Franklin creates electronic reference products to provide instant
   access to data anywhere at any time for audiences ranging from young
   children to seasoned medical practicioners, foreign travelers,
   students, professionals and leisure-time readers. The platforms
   retrieve data through keyboard commands and display it on a liquid
   crystal screen. The Company's product line encompasses more than 200
   titles, including dictionaries in 16 languages, translators, Holy
   Bibles, encyclopedias, medical references, family health guides,
   entertainment and educational publications.

   <p>Franklin's platforms offer several special advantages to create value
   and ease of use for its customers. Many products contain the BOOKMAN®
   feature, which supplements a built-in database with the ability to
   read from one or two book (ROM) cards holding additional works, giving
   readers access to more than one title at a time. Franklin's speaking
   products are an exceptionally useful tool in polishing English and
   Spanish pronunciation, give a vibrant voice to content in products
   such as a Holy Bible with daily devotionals read by musical legend
   Johnny Cash, and even help users with special needs to learn and
   communicate better.

   <p>The Company has an unrivalled ability to adapt books for handheld
   platforms, and has broadened the scope of its business to achieve its
   goal of giving customers an array of choices of reference works, not
   just for Franklin's platforms, but for other popular handheld devices
   such as Palm®, Windows® CE, Psion® and Handspring®. Franklin has
   expanded its long-standing, successful relationships with major
   publishers in the reference and medical fields to offer downloadable
   versions of indispensable medical works such as the Physicians' Desk
   Reference ("PDR®). Franklin's website, http://www.franklin.com,
   generated more than 21,000,000 hits in 1999, and is the source for
   downloadable content for Franklin and non-Franklin platforms.

   <p>Franklin has positioned itself for continued growth through its
   leadership in hardware and software technology, and its established
   and expanding relationships with publishers. The Company enjoys
   dominant market shares in North America, Europe, and the Middle East,
   and is expanding its sales and distribution efforts in the Far East.
   The Company has licensing agreements with leading print publishers
   such as Merriam-Webster, HarperCollins and Havas Interactive for
   dictionaries; Merck and Medical Economics for medical products such as
   the Merck Manual and the Pocket PDR® Medical Book System(TM); and
   various entertainment publishers for crossword and game products.
   Franklin also has formed a joint venture with Kinpo Electronics, a
   major manufacturer, to develop Chinese/English reference products to
   meet the needs of the Pan-Asian market.

   <p>Franklin has sold more than 21,000,000 books, and sells products
   through 45,000 retail outlets worldwide, online through its website,
   via direct marketing, and through sales and distribution subsidiaries
   in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the Benelux countries, Canada,
   Australia and Mexico. The Company has production management offices in
   Tokyo and Hong Kong. In addition, Franklin's OEM/Vertical Market
   division serves the medical and educational communities and develops
   custom products for publishers and other information providers.

   <p>Franklin, the exclusive producer and provider of ROLODEX® Electronics
   personal information management products, revitalized its organizer
   line in 1999 to offer more features at lower price points and improved
   connectivity with users' personal computers.
