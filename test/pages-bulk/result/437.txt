   <h>Ruling on after-school religious meetings fuels church-state debate

   <h>Analysis

   <p>WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court yesterday had good news for the Good
   News Club of Milford, N.Y.: Its intensely proselytizing meetings may
   take place on public school grounds right after regular classes are
   over.

   <p>But what does the 6-3 decision in Good News Club v. Milford Central
   School portend for other church-state relationships, including school
   voucher programs and President Bush's charitable-choice initiative
   that would increase the involvement of religious groups in the
   delivery of public services?

   <p>There was considerable disagreement on that point in the wake of the
   high court ruling, which continues the court's recent trend of viewing
   student religious activities as a form of protected free expression
   rather than as an establishment of religion. Using the language of
   free-speech cases, the court said the school district engaged in
   unconstitutional "viewpoint discrimination" when it barred the Good
   News Club from meeting after school in an elementary school cafeteria.
   The meetings were aimed at exposing children age six through 12 to
   Christian Bible teachings.

   <p>Pepperdine University law professor Douglas Kmiec, incoming dean of
   Catholic University's law school, said the ruling's emphasis on equal
   treatment of religious and nonreligious organizations by government
   would boost the Bush initiative.

   <p>"President Bush's proposal is not to single out the religious groups
   for favoritism, but to include them as additional options or resources
   addressing everything from job training to mental health counseling to
   substance abuse treatment," said Kmiec. "The court has signaled by
   this opinion that there is little to no legal objection to his doing
   so."

   <p>Kmiec also said the decision would be an encouragement for voucher
   programs that include parochial schools.

   <p>But University of Texas law professor Douglas Laycock, also an expert
   on church-state legal doctrine, said yesterday's ruling would have no
   impact on charitable choice or vouchers.

   <p>"Financial aid cases and speech cases are still viewed differently by
   the court," Laycock said. Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony
   Kennedy -- both in the majority yesterday -- are generally more
   skeptical when government is giving money, rather than access, to
   religious organizations.

   <p>The most immediate effect of the decision will be felt at public
   schools, which may have a harder time arguing that a group's meetings
   are "too religious" to be held on school premises.

   <p>The ruling appears to erase a line that several appeals courts had
   drawn between permissible clubs that discuss social issues from a
   religious perspective and organizations that can be barred because
   they are too much like worship services or are aimed at converting
   students.

   <p>"We disagree that something that is 'quintessentially religious' or
   'decidedly religious in nature' cannot also be characterized properly
   as the teaching of morals and character development," wrote Justice
   Clarence Thomas for the majority. "We can see no logical difference in
   kind between the invocation of Christianity by the Club and the
   invocation of teamwork, loyalty, or patriotism by other associations
   to provide a foundation for their lessons."

   <p>School officials say the ruling will make it difficult for them to
   prohibit the use of school facilities for any kind of religious
   purpose -- including Sabbath worship services, which are already
   permitted in many districts, especially in the South. One unappealing
   choice for schools would be to prohibit all after-school meetings,
   including religious ones, thereby giving equal treatment to all.

   <p>(The Associated Press reported today that school officials in Milford
   were weighing two options in response to yesterday's ruling: barring
   all groups from meeting there or pushing starting times back for all
   clubs until 5 p.m. or 6 p.m., a few hours after students are
   dismissed.

   <p>The Rev. Stephen Fournier, organizer of the Good News Club, said the
   second choice wouldn't work because the group wants to meet directly
   after school so it can reach the most students.

   <p>"That rules out the club meeting at the school," said Fournier, pastor
   of Milford Community Bible Church. "The best opportunity for us to
   reach the kids was right after school."

   <p>Superintendent Peter Livshin told the AP the school board planned to
   meet June 14 to begin talking about a new policy and would have new
   rules in place before the beginning of the next school year.)

   <p>Meanwhile, in dissent yesterday, Justice David Souter expressed fear
   that the high court's ruling could stand for "the remarkable
   proposition that any public school opened for civic meetings must be
   opened for use as a church, synagogue or mosque."

   <p>Souter also said, "It is beyond question that Good News intends to use
   the public school premises not for the mere discussion of a subject
   from a particular, Christian point of view, but for an evangelical
   service of worship calling children to commit themselves in an act of
   Christian conversion." Thomas's majority opinion said Souter's
   description of the club's activities was accurate. Joining Souter's
   dissent were Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

   <p>The ruling also appeared to break new ground in the court's analysis
   of the perceptions of elementary school children. Traditionally, in
   speech as well as religion cases, the court has said that the younger
   the audience, the more impressionable it is -- and therefore, the
   easier it is for government to restrict the message the children are
   receiving.

   <p>In the case decided yesterday, Milford officials had argued that
   elementary-age children would gain the impression that the state was
   endorsing religion if they saw the club convening at school, even
   after classes are over.

   <p>But Justice Thomas's majority opinion dismissed that argument. Thomas
   asserted that parents, who must give permission for their children to
   attend the meetings, would not be confused about whether the school
   system was endorsing religion.

   <p>As for the perceptions of the children themselves, Thomas said, "We
   cannot say the danger that children would misperceive the endorsement
   of religion is any greater than the danger that they would perceive a
   hostility toward the religious viewpoint if the Club were excluded
   from the public forum."

   <p>Critics of the decision decried the court's new approach on this
   issue.

   <p>"This decision ignores the practical reality that students will
   perceive the school's endorsement of the religious worship when it is
   conducted on elementary school premises," said Julie Underwood,
   general counsel for the National School Boards Association.

   <p>Steven Shapiro, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union,
   agreed. "In the minds of impressionable young students, today's
   decision is likely to blur the line between public school and Sunday
   school," he said.

   <p>The decision reaffirmed two earlier Supreme Court rulings: Lamb's
   Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School District in 1993 and
   Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of University of Virginia in 1995.
   Both opinions call for equal treatment of religious viewpoints in
   public forums.

   <p>But several organizations that favor greater separation of church and
   state were upset that the court majority saw no difference between the
   religious meetings in Lamb's Chapel and those sponsored by the Good
   News Club. In Lamb's Chapel, the organization sought to show a film
   series on school premises that discussed secular social and family
   issues from a religious viewpoint.

   <p>"In glossing over the vast factual distinctions between the Good News
   Club and the court's ruling in Lamb's Chapel," said the American
   Jewish Committee, "the court applied existing principles of law in a
   way that defies common sense."

   <p>But the decision drew cheers from groups that have sought equal
   treatment for religious viewpoints in public forums.

   <p>"The court reaffirmed that government should act with benevolent
   neutrality toward religion and not with malevolent hostility," said
   Jan LaRue of the Family Research Council.

   <p>"The Supreme Court decision represents an important victory for the
   First Amendment and sends a powerful message that religious
   organizations must receive equal treatment," said Jay Sekulow, chief
   counsel of the American Center for Law and Justice, who argued the
   Lamb's Chapel case. "The court's decision today clearly shows there is
   no constitutional crisis created when a religious organization
   receives the same treatment afforded to other organizations."
