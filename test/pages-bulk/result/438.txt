<h>Ten Candles for the 'Contract'

<h>The Contract With America's legacy, and the future of big, bold ideas.

   <h>By:  Dick Armey 

   <p>This piece was originally published in the Washington Times on
   September 26, 2004
   <p>Ten years ago, under blue skies on the back steps of the U.S. Capitol,
   367 Republican members of the House of Representatives and candidates
   pledged to "restore the bonds of trust between the people and their
   elected representatives."
   <p>Thus, on Sept. 27, 1994, the Contract With America was born.
   Republicans used it to launch big ideas into the election year debate
   -- ideas like a balanced budget, welfare reform, congressional reform,
   and limits on lawsuit abuse.
   <p>The Contract nationalized the election and turned Tip O'Neill's maxim
   that "all politics is local" on its head. We promised America that
   day: "If we break this Contract, throw us out."
   <p>When the Contract was presented, the media reacted with predictable
   disdain and doubt. Pundits parroted the O'Neill adage that "all
   politics is local" -- a cynical way to imply Americans care more about
   highway pork and pancake breakfasts than detailed visions for the
   country. Even on policy, editorials attacked the Contract as
   "anti-poor" and "fiscally irresponsible," and Clinton adviser George
   Stephanopoulos said, "I'll match our record vs. their Contract any
   day." The Democratic National Committee launched negative ads, darkly
   saying the Contract would "return us to the Reagan years." I wish the
   DNC ran ads about the Reagan years every election.
   <p>Of course, in state after state, people voted for overwhelmingly for
   the Contract With America. Newt Gingrich estimated these ideas
   mobilized 9 million new voters in the 1994 elections. In the end,
   Republicans gained 52 seats and ended four decades of Democratic
   control of the House of Representatives.
   <p>As promised, the new Republican House brought all 10 items in the
   Contract to a vote in the first 100 days. We imposed term limits for
   House Committee chairmanships and forced Congress to follow the labor
   laws it imposes on everyone else. The federal budget was cut by 3½
   percent in the first two years and balanced in less than four. Most
   importantly, we passed real welfare reform and ended the welfare
   entitlement.
   <p>The Contract's welfare reform emphasized work and personal
   responsibility, which have cut caseloads in half and liberated
   millions from the destructive cycle of dependency.
   <p>The Republican House was not able to pass all the Contract into law,
   mostly due to obstructionism in the Senate and by President Clinton.
   But congressional Republicans fulfilled the Contract, and were able to
   run on a new slogan in 1996: "Promises made, promises kept." The
   American public confirmed its endorsement of limited government by
   voting in another Republican majority, marking the first time
   Republicans held onto back-to-back majorities in Congress since 1928.
   Today, after 10 years, the Contract's success sets the scene for
   conservatives to present another platform of big, bold ideas to move
   the nation forward. President Bush began this dialogue with his recent
   call for creating an "Ownership Society." Basic tax reform, tort
   reform and Social Security personal retirement accounts are the big,
   bold ideas to again create cohesion and a unified agenda for
   congressional Republicans.
   <p>Indeed, no bigger opportunity confronts us than transforming the
   current Social Security system into a system of personal accounts
   owned and controlled by individual taxpayers, not the government. Big
   accounts -- at least half of the current payroll tax -- can solve the
   system's looming financial meltdown and protect current retirees'
   benefits without tax increases.
   <p>Like the Contract in 1994, in 2004 Social Security reform also engages
   new voters in the political process, including younger voters,
   African-Americans and Hispanics, all of whom get especially bad deals
   from the current system. Let's create genuine retirement security by
   letting every working taxpayer build a nest egg and a stake in future
   U.S. economic growth.
   <p>The Contract With America demonstrated that a clear, principled agenda
   articulated directly to voters can create a powerful political and
   legislative force for change. As we look back upon the enduring
   success of the Contract after a full decade, the road forward becomes
   clear. If we seize them, the bold ideas of the "Ownership Society" are
   ready to spark the next conservative leap forward.
