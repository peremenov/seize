     <h>Blood in the Face 
   <h>A Film by Anne Bohlen, Kevin Rafferty, and James Ridgeway
<p> Allowed access to national gatherings of U.S. radical right
   groups including the Ku Klux Klan and the Posse Comitatus, BLOOD IN
   THE FACE straightforwardly presents the views of people whose avowed
   goal is to forge a political union which will transform North America
   into one Aryan nation.

   <p>Blatantly and without flinching, members of these groups describe
   their agenda of anti-semitism, racism, and extreme nationalism. Their
   heroes are Adolf Hitler and George Lincoln Rockwell, founder of the
   American Nazi Party. Wedding ceremonies are performed at burning
   crosses. Their message is spread through their own home video network.

   <p>BLOOD IN THE FACE, whose title refers to the belief that only white
   people can blush, is a searing record of America's radical right, a
   social and political force which can no longer be dismissed.

   <p>"The riveting documentary... is neither as uproarious as ROGER AND ME
   nor as jazzy as THE ATOMIC CAFE, but it is far more insidiously spooky
   in its picture of the extreme right. BLOOD IN THE FACE is first-rate
   journalism." - Vincent Canby, New York Times
   <p>"**** [4 Stars - Highly Recommended] The terror of this program is in
   the quiet, deadly rationalizations of its fanatical subjects. It is an
   excellent introduction to the racist, far-right political elements in
   America and Canada." - Video Rating Guide for Libraries

   <p>South: The heart of this journey is the brutal murder of James Byrd,

   it is an evocation of how this event fits in to a landscape and
   climate as much mental as physical.
