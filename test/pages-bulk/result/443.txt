     _________________________________________________________________

                                <h>Introduction

   <p>Good afternoon. I am delighted to be here, and I am honored to be back
   at the FTC as its Chairman.

   <p>As many of you may know, this is my third tour at the FTC. I first
   served as Assistant to the Director of the Office of Policy Planning
   and Evaluation in the mid 1970s. I returned in 1981 to serve as the
   Director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection, and then became
   Director of the Bureau of Competition in 1983. I am fully committed to
   the institution and its mission of protecting consumers through
   actively enforcing our antitrust and consumer protection laws. I
   return as Chairman with great anticipation of the challenges and
   excitement that lie ahead.

   <p>There has been considerable speculation about possible changes at the
   Commission. Some predicted that there would be substantial continuity
   from the previous administration, with changes mainly at the margins.
   Others agreed that there would be continuity but hedged their bets -
   they were uncertain how wide the margins might be. Others predicted -
   perhaps wishfully - that changes would be more dramatic. For example,
   they anticipated substantially reduced merger enforcement. I expect
   the last group will be disappointed. A vigorous enforcement program is
   necessary to fulfill the agency's mission to protect consumers. The
   first group has it right. Continuity will be the norm, with changes at
   the margins.

   <p>We have assembled a first-rate staff. In the operating Bureaus, we
   have: Howard Beales, Director of the Bureau of Consumer Protection;
   Bill Kovacic, General Counsel; David Scheffman, Director of the Bureau
   of Economics; and Joe Simons, Director of the Bureau of Competition.
   All have extensive experience in their fields; each has substantial
   prior experience at the FTC; and each has extensive post-FTC
   experience related to the agency's mission. Joining this group are
   Anna Davis, Director of Congressional Relations, who also previously
   worked at the FTC, Rosemarie Straight, who remains as Executive
   Director, and two newcomers: Ted Cruz, who is our new Director of
   Policy Planning, and Cathy MacFarlane, who will head our Office of
   Public Affairs. I appointed these individuals because of their superb
   qualifications and, like me, they are committed to the FTC and its
   mission.

   <p>Today, I will sketch a vision of the landscape ahead. Along the way, I
   will retrace the origins of some of the policies that I expect to
   follow. You will see that continuity should not come as a surprise.
   There is much ground to cover, and I will touch on each topic only
   briefly. You will hear more about each of these subjects in the coming
   months.

   <p>Before continuing, I should repeat the standard disclaimer that my
   remarks today are my own, and not necessarily those of the Commission
   or of any other Commissioner.

                    <h>I. Why Should We Expect Continuity?

   <p>Antitrust has become an area of bipartisan cooperation. Although there
   are disagreements about specific cases, there is widespread agreement
   that the purpose of antitrust is to protect consumers, that economic
   analysis should guide case selection, and that horizontal cases, both
   mergers and agreements among competitors, are the mainstays of
   antitrust. Moreover, today there is bipartisan recognition that
   antitrust law is a way of helping to organize our economy. A freely
   functioning market, subject to the rules of antitrust, provides
   maximum benefits to consumers.

   <p>Bob Pitofsky's tenure as FTC Chairman was in that vein of
   bipartisanship. In fact, he and his appointees praised the leadership
   of his predecessor, Janet Steiger, who was appointed by the first
   President Bush. Bob was clearly one of the most effective Chairmen in
   the history of the Commission.^ Of course, Bob brought his
   intellect, scholarship, and management skills to the job. But a key
   reason for Bob's success as Chairman was that his agenda and
   enforcement policies reflected the bipartisan consensus. Those
   policies were not significantly different from those of his
   predecessor in the previous administration. There were changes at the
   margins, and, as would any new chairman, Bob faced some new
   challenges. That is my message today - there will be some changes at
   the margins, but mainly there will be continuity. There will not be a
   sea change in enforcement.

   <p>Bob Pitofsky set a high standard, and he should be applauded for his
   efforts on behalf of consumers. He and I may differ on certain points,
   but I, too, intend to characterize my tenure by what I do, rather than
   what I do not do. Let me turn to some specific areas of antitrust.

                          <h> II. Merger Enforcement

   <p>This year is the 25^th anniversary of the passage of the
   Hart-Scott-Rodino Act.

   <p>The passage of HSR and the resulting evolution of merger enforcement
   policy has undoubtedly been the most important statutory development
   in antitrust for several decades. Like antitrust enforcement
   generally, merger enforcement is about protecting consumers from
   unwarranted exercise of market power. As the Chairman of the FTC, I
   take that mandate very seriously. I do not see significant change in
   basic merger enforcement from the Pitofsky Commission. We will apply
   the Merger Guidelines to the available facts, as did the Pitofsky
   Commission. Problematic mergers will face the same hurdles they did
   during the 1990s.

   <h>A. Evolution of Merger Policy in the 1970s and Early 1980s

   <p>Let me add some historical perspective on why continuity is
   appropriate. By the time of the General Dynamics decision in 1974,
   it was clear that merger policy would have to change to reflect new
   realities. Cases like Von's were relics of the past. Economic
   research debunked the fears of market concentration at even low
   levels. Rigid reliance on concentration statistics and structural
   presumptions would no longer suffice; we would have to look at the
   competitive dynamics of the market. There was growing awareness that
   we live in a global economy - market boundaries don't necessarily end
   at the U.S. border. And there was a growing realization that
   efficiencies are important.

   <p>Those changes were reflected in 1982 Merger Guidelines,
   promulgated during Bill Baxter's regime at the Antitrust Division. The
   new Guidelines were a milestone in antitrust. They incorporated an
   economically sound analytical structure that was workable in practice
   and provided clear guideposts for businesses and antitrust
   practitioners.

   <p>The 1982 Guidelines laid the foundation for today's merger
   enforcement. Although improved over the years, the core analytical
   structure remains the same. The Guidelines have stood the test of time
   and have become even more influential. The courts increasingly follow
   them, and they have greatly influenced merger enforcement across the
   world. Bill Baxter is, unfortunately, no longer with us, but his
   legacy lives on. His Guidelines were applied by Bob Pitofsky's
   Commission, and I expect to do the same.

   <p>In fact, I was one of the early implementers of the 1982 Guidelines'
   analytical structure. We were an active, even proactive Commission
   back then. I became Director of the Bureau of Competition in 1983, and
   during my 2½ years in that position, we dealt with matters such as:
     <l>* Texaco-Getty and SoCal-Gulf- two transactions that, at
       that time, were considered large oil mergers;
     <l>* One of the first consumer branded products mergers analyzed under
       the Guidelines;
     <l>* One of the first instances of "competing mergers" - two mergers in
       the carbon black industry;
     <l>* Warner-Polygram, a large merger in the entertainment
       industry;
     <l>* The GM-Toyota joint venture in California;
     <l>* Pilkington Brothers, a flat glass merger that involved a
       non-domestic company.
     <l>* Allied Corp., a merger involving avionics for general aviation
       aircraft.

   <p>These were important cases, and their influence is present today. Our
   analysis of the Texaco/Getty and SoCal/Gulf transactions, and the 1982
   FTC Oil Merger Report, laid out most of the basics of how the FTC
   has analyzed much larger oil mergers over the past decade. The
   consumer products merger investigation was one of the first to use
   statistical methodologies to analyze substitutability of branded
   products. That analysis by our Bureau of Economics stimulated further
   research and paved the way for today's major cottage industry of
   economists doing econometric analyses of consumer demand for branded
   products.

   <p>Warner-Polygram presented very complex issues in analyzing coordinated
   interaction in a dynamic industry that thrives by constantly
   developing new, differentiated products. Both Warner-Polygram and the
   two carbon black mergers were successfully challenged in court. The
   Warner-Polygram decision has been very influential in the Commission's
   ability to obtain preliminary injunctions under Section 13(b) of the
   FTC Act.

   <p>Finally, the Commission's lengthy, very extensive investigation of the
   GM-Toyota joint venture was important, both for the U.S. automobile
   industry and American consumers, and in guiding later thinking about
   joint ventures. Our examination of the potential efficiencies of the
   joint venture was controversial at the time. Today, however, there are
   few who would argue with allowing the venture to proceed.

   <h>B. The Importance of Facts

   <p>Those of you who were involved with mergers in those early days
   following the 1982 Guidelines know that we all had a lot to learn.
   This was particularly true of the Guidelines' new approach to market
   definition. We also quickly learned that merger analysis under this
   new regime was incredibly fact intensive.

   <p>John Adams, one of the Founding Fathers of this country, once
   discussed facts in a manner directly relevant for us today. In 1770,
   Adams defended the British officer and soldiers accused of murder in
   the Boston Massacre. He said:

   <p>Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our
   inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they cannot alter the
   state of facts and evidence.

   <p>Stubborn facts are what changed antitrust law and enforcement after
   the 1970s. For example, a 1983 Washington Post editorial on the
   GM-Toyota joint venture stated:

     <p>[T]he rules of antitrust law as they had developed [in the 1960s
     and 1970s] were undermined by observation of how the world
     works.

   <p>We learned long ago that facts are stubborn things in merger
   enforcement. No economic theory or story-based advocacy about a merger
   will give you a reliable answer unless the facts firmly support it.
   This is absolutely as it should be. This is why no change in
   Administration or change in faces in the agencies will significantly
   change merger enforcement. Just as we have the burden of proving that
   a merger likely will be anticompetitive, you will need to demonstrate
   with sound, stubborn fact-based analyses the claims that you make.

   <h>C. Maintaining the Basic Approach

   <p>By saying that there will be continuity, I do not mean to suggest that
   I agreed with every specific enforcement action of the Pitofsky
   Commission; I did not. Overwhelmingly, however, when the parties
   pushed the Commission into court, the Commission won. So, how stubborn
   do your facts have to be? I agree with the approach of the Pitofsky
   Commission. If a merger appears problematic, the facts on your side
   have to be stubborn enough to convince a federal judge that we cannot
   obtain a preliminary injunction.

   <p>I know that some in the press and the Bar think that the Bush
   administration will relax antitrust enforcement. I urge them, and you,
   to watch what we do. I can tell you unequivocally that if you come in
   with transactions that would not fly in the past, you are likely to
   "crash"unless you have compelling, stubborn facts on your side. To
   some of you, let me say it more bluntly. A few members of the merger
   bar have been telling the press that we are going to have more relaxed
   standards. Those folks will be doing their actual or potential clients
   a big disservice if those clients act on that presumption. If you are
   an experienced merger attorney, you know a problematic merger when you
   see it.

   <h>D. Attention to Competitive Effects Theories

   <p>Staying the course does not mean that we will stop thinking about the
   theories we apply. Theories of anticompetitive effects have evolved
   over time, and will continue to do so. For example, although we have
   always had what could be called "unilateral effects" theories, they
   have evolved, and they have been more widely applied since the 1992
   revision of the Guidelines.Some question whether the agency has
   gone too far in applying unilateral effects theories. One argument is
   that we may be in danger of returning to antitrust that focused on the
   elimination of competition between the parties to the merger, rather
   than competition at the market level. I would not go that far. It is
   too early to tell whether theory has outstripped reality. I do agree
   that we should be sure that we have the facts to apply a unilateral
   effects theory.

   <p>The analysis of unilateral effects often relies substantially on
   econometric analysis of scanner data. We need to understand better the
   potential limitations of the data. Although the analysis is highly
   complex, the theories underlying merger simulation models are based on
   simple and restrictive assumptions. These can be useful tools, but we
   are looking at them more closely to understand better their strengths
   and limitations.

   <p>Coordinated interaction theories have also evolved. In recent years
   there has been more focus on theories of coordinated interaction
   involving alleged price discrimination. This is an area in which facts
   are particularly important. We all understand that price differences,
   themselves, are not evidence of price discrimination. Price
   discrimination requires, among other things, "systematic" pricing
   policies that result in evidence of actual transaction prices that is
   consistent with a theory of price discrimination.

   <h>E. Areas Where Enforcement Policy is Still Evolving

   <p>Although the basics of merger enforcement are firmly in place, there
   are important substantive areas that are still evolving: "high
   tech"mergers involving significant innovation issues; efficiencies;
   and remedies.

         <h> High Tech Mergers

   <p>Merger analysis in "high tech" industries is not fundamentally
   different than in other industries. The basic Guidelines analysis can
   be applied. We should proceed, however, cognizant of our lesser
   experience in high tech industries. Moreover, the high tech arena, by
   its nature, is constantly changing. New high tech industries, often
   with new technical issues, continue to be born and to change.

   <p>One aspect of high tech may warrant especially close scrutiny. The
   fierce competition for success in these industries often results in
   the "winner" enjoying a (perhaps short-lived) monopoly. We should be
   especially reluctant to allow those firms to merge with actual (or
   potential) competitors. This was part of the basis for my criticism of
   the Clinton Antitrust Division's failure to challenge the
   Microsoft-Web TV merger.

   <p>Given the relative newness of applying the Guidelines to high tech
   industries, we should assess the effects of our enforcement actions,
   as well as monitor the outcomes when we decide not to intervene. We
   will look for opportunities to use the Bureau of Economics in these
   retrospective examinations to help inform future decisions.

          <h>Efficiencies

   <p>The agencies have come far in recognizing the significance of merger
   efficiencies. In 1980, I wrote an article arguing that the agencies
   should recognize the relevance of merger efficiency claims.
   Today, there is no question that they are relevant, as the 1992
   Horizontal Merger Guidelines reflected. The 1997 revision of the
   Efficiencies section of the Guidelines further improved the analytical
   treatment of efficiencies. And a growing number of courts now
   recognize the relevance of efficiency claims.

   <p>Despite this progress, the treatment of efficiencies in merger
   enforcement has room for further improvement. I have argued that the
   agencies should recognize additional classes of efficiencies, and that
   their argument in court is still much too hostile.The analysis
   will continue to evolve based on facts and study. These are changes at
   the margin, however. From my experience in the 1980s and as a
   consultant, few cases will turn solely on the efficiency issue. The
   bedrock principle of merger enforcement remains the same - protect
   consumers. In efficiencies, as in any other analysis, the facts are
   crucial. Efficiency claims that are not firmly based in stubborn facts
   will be given no weight.

          <h>Remedies

   <p>The Commission's recent posture on merger remedies is controversial
   within the bar. Merger remedies, like other aspects of antitrust, have
   evolved during the last 20 years. During much of the 1980s, the agency
   resolved cases relatively less frequently with settlements. When we
   did settle, however, we insisted on strong structural relief. Our
   lengthy review and negotiations for remedies in the Texaco-Getty
   matter in 1984 led some lawyers for Texaco to suggest that we were a
   distraction from their goals. That view of our role is misinformed. An
   effective remedy is a fundamental part of merger enforcement. Now, as
   then, we must protect consumers, not help you get your deal through at
   consumers' expense.

   <p>One of the techniques the Commission has recently used is an up-front
   buyer of divested assets. Much of the criticism in the Bar has been
   that the process of identifying and vetting an up-front buyer slows
   down the settlement process. A countervailing consideration is that an
   up-front buyer can provide added assurance that a settlement will work
   as planned. It may be particularly useful when proposed divestiture
   involves an asset package that constitutes less than an ongoing
   business, whose viability is somewhat uncertain, or assets that may
   deteriorate over time. There is thus an appropriate use for up-front
   buyers on occasion.

   <p>An up-front buyer is not an end in itself, of course. Our principal
   goal is to protect consumers. We will require a divestiture that will
   likely create a viable business entity (rather than a creation of
   lawyers) to resolve the competitive problems posed by the merger. We
   may be confident before identifying one specific buyer that acceptable
   candidates exist. As with so much else of modern merger analysis, the
   issue is highly fact specific.

   <h>F. The Merger Review Process

   <p>As I noted earlier, this year marks the 25^th Anniversary of the
   Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. A lot has changed. When I became Director of
   the Bureau of Competition in 1983, the merger review process under HSR
   was still evolving; we were still on the learning curve. Today, we
   have a well-functioning program in place - not perfect, as all of you
   will agree, but it does a remarkable job. We have a smaller
   professional staff than we did in the early 1980s, as well as fewer
   support staff, but we review many times more merger filings. We have
   highly skilled and dedicated lawyers and economists, and an excellent
   senior management team. The Bureau of Competition and Bureau of
   Economics work closely together. Merger review is firmly grounded in
   facts and sound economic analysis.

   <p>But as I said, not all is perfect. Thousands of mergers are filed each
   year, and some questionable transactions may slip through the
   screening process. The recent amendments to the HSR Act, which
   increased the filing threshold, may have made it more likely that we
   will miss a few problematic transactions. I have directed BC Director
   Joe Simons to increase our efforts in reviewing the business press and
   other sources to identify potentially problematic mergers. If you have
   clients that are concerned with a transaction, let us know - whether
   or not it has been consummated. We are quite prepared to go after
   consummated mergers or mergers that are too small to require an HSR
   filing. In addition, we will continue to vigorously pursue parties who
   do not comply with the procedural requirements of the HSR regulations,
   our first line of defense against anticompetitive mergers. Some of you
   may recall that, during my tenure as Bureau Director, we brought the
   first 7(a) case.

   <p>Let me turn now to 2^nd Requests. The burdens of the 2^nd Request
   process continue to be a concern. Although the agencies have made
   substantial efforts to reduce the burden, there is room for further
   improvement. The number of boxes of documents submitted for a typical
   2^nd Request has sky-rocketed. Where once we had hundreds of boxes, in
   some matters we now have thousands of boxes. Of course, some mergers
   are very complex and tend to involve volumes of documents. Moreover, I
   have worked on enough mergers to know that you are not always trying
   to make the agency's job easy. In any event, given the burdens
   involved for both the merging parties and agency staff, we need to
   find ways to do our jobs more efficiently. We need to ensure that what
   you submit is as helpful as possible to our doing our job of
   protecting consumers. We will have more to say about this in the
   coming months.

   <p>We are also trying to make merger investigations more efficient in
   other ways. As we all know, the statutory deadlines are almost never
   binding for a problematic merger. Because the deadlines are too short
   to analyze a complex merger fully, we usually arrange an accommodation
   for more time. Nonetheless, merger investigations, on average,
   probably take longer than necessary. We will try to expedite the
   process further.

   <p>Improved communication is part of the answer. Both sides have to join
   issue on the critical aspects of a merger. If a merger appears
   problematic, the burden is on the parties to convince us that there
   are no problems or that any problems can be fully remedied with a
   suitable divestiture. Without jeopardizing our position in potential
   litigation, we can probably communicate more clearly to the parties
   the bases of our concerns. Joe Simons and I are working to develop and
   implement procedures to improve the merger review process without
   compromising the ability to do our job.

   <p>In that vein, we will be conducting "best practices" sessions with the
   Antitrust Division, beginning with 2d Request and remedies issues, to
   strengthen both of our agencies. In addition, the Bureau of
   Competition is planning a series of "brown bag" lunches in Washington,
   D.C., and some of our regional offices to discuss your concerns about
   remedies. We hope that these steps will offer additional bases for
   improving the merger review process.

                       <h> III. International Antitrust

   <p>Let me turn to a new topic: competition policy in a global economy.
   Increasingly, U.S. companies and the U.S. antitrust agencies interact
   with our competition law counterparts. These interactions raise a
   multitude of procedural and substantive issues. The FTC is certain to
   give increasing attention to these international issues. Among other
   matters, we will:
     <l>* Continue information exchanges with foreign antitrust enforcement
       authorities to promote the effective handling of particular
       matters involving multiple jurisdictions;
     <l>* Devote greater efforts to bi-lateral discussions with our foreign
       counterparts to establish a consensus about "best practices" in
       process and substantive analysis;
     <l>* Continue to participate in multinational initiatives (OECD, WTO,
       Global Competition Initiative, and others) to help streamline
       antitrust procedures and encouraging acceptance of the best
       analytical methods; and
     <l>* Continue our efforts to assist transition economies to build
       sensible competition policy and consumer protection systems.

  <p> Our General Counsel, Bill Kovacic, has established within his office
   an international coordination function focusing on technical
   assistance to transition economies. To manage this function, I have
   appointed my long-time friend Jim Hamill to be Senior Counsel for
   International Affairs in the General Counsel's office. The Bureau of
   Competition's International Division, headed by Randy Tritell, will
   continue to handle liaison with foreign antitrust authorities and
   multinational institutions.

                         <h>IV. Non-Merger Enforcement

   <p>Let me move to a brief discussion of non-merger enforcement. There are
   several important issues here, such as competition in pharmaceuticals
   and intellectual property issues. As in the case of merger
   enforcement, facts are critical. Our cases will be empirically
   grounded. Sound theory is important, but it must fit the facts of the
   case. 

   <p>My interest in non-merger enforcement should not be surprising. The
   Commission was very active in pursuing non-merger matters when I was
   the Director of the Bureau of Competition in the early1980s. During my
   tenure, we put 17 non-merger cases in "Part III" administrative
   litigation. Important cases such as TICOR, Superior Court Trial
   Lawyers Ass'n, Mass Board,Detroit Auto Dealers,
   Taxicabs,and U-Haulwere among that group. Each case that
   we litigated was decided against the respondents, including three that
   went to the Supreme Court.

   <p>More recent developments confirm the importance of a strong non-merger
   agenda. We used to believe that antitrust counseling, at least for
   major companies, would generally deter anticompetitive conduct. We
   have learned, however, from ADM, the vitamins case, numerous
   other price-fixing cases, and from Microsoft, that the antitrust
   agencies must aggressively police competitive conduct. In a recent
   matter the Commission issued Complaints because there was reason to
   believe that competitors engaged in per se violations.

   <p>Let me now explore a few areas of current interest.

   <h>A. Hatch-Waxman Issues

   <p>The Pitofsky Commission was very active in looking at potential abuses
   of the Hatch-Waxman Act, which was intended to promote generic
   competition in the pharmaceutical industry. We are continuing those
   efforts. The competitiveness of the pharmaceutical industry is very
   important to American consumers. We have a number of active, ongoing
   investigations, and we are also conducting a study of Hatch-Waxman
   related issues. As you probably know, a number of legislative
   proposals have been made to modify Hatch-Waxman to curb the alleged
   abuses. Our study and our experience in investigating these issues may
   provide some guidance for potential modifications of the Act.

   <h>B. Horizontal Emphasis

   <p>It is uncontroversial that horizontal activities should be a major
   focus of non-merger enforcement. You can be sure that we are going to
   be very active in finding, investigating, and bringing actions against
   anticompetitive horizontal activities. We already have a number of new
   initiatives under way. The professions and health care are areas of
   particular interest.

   <p>One of the issues we will be dealing with is the legal standard for
   judging some of these horizontal agreements. When I was at the Bureau
   of Competition in the 1980s, we developed a truncated rule of reason
   analysis that the Commission adopted in Massachusetts Bd. of
   Registration of Optometry. Mass Board applied a structured
   analysis that avoided a rigid per se/rule of reason categorization. It
   provided an intermediate form of analysis for inherently suspect
   restraints that appear likely, absent an efficiency justification, to
   restrict competition and reduce output. The Commission decided not to
   apply the Mass Board methodology in the California Dental Association
   case, opting instead to use the traditional per se/rule of reason
   categorization. It held the advertising restraints in that case to be
   unlawful under both the per se standard and an abbreviated rule of
   reason analysis. The Ninth Circuit affirmed under the abbreviated rule
   of reason theory, but the Supreme Court reversed, holding the
   Commission's analysis to be too abbreviated. What is required, said
   the Court, is "an enquiry meet for the case, looking to the
   circumstances, details, and logic of a restraint." It therefore
   teaches that facts, not rigid categories, should guide the analysis.

   <p>In light of CDA, we have more work to do to develop a workable
   approach that is consistent with the law. I believe the Commission
   would have prevailed in that case had it been tried under the Mass
   Board standard, with record evidence to explain why the advertising
   restraints should be analyzed under a truncated approach. That
   evidence was available. There is plentiful empirical evidence
   demonstrating the deleterious effects on price and quality flowing
   from restrictions on professional advertising, but the record
   contained precious little of that evidence. Regardless of the precise
   form of truncated analysis one chooses to use, the key to prosecuting
   such a case successfully is to build a record that contains support
   for claims of probable anticompetitive effect.

   <p>Two other issues we will be looking at are the Noerr-Pennington and
   State Action exemptions. You may recall that we brought cases
   involving these areas during my stint as Competition Bureau Director
   in the 1980s - Ticor and U-Haul. The Transition Report prepared by the
   ABA Antitrust Section stated that the state action exemption still
   presents concerns from a competition policy standpoint.The
   Report recommended a reexamination of the scope of the exemption. We
   are doing that.

   <h>C. Monopolization

   <p>Some of you may be wondering what my position will be on
   monopolization cases. Again, it is the stubborn facts that count most.
   Where we can show that exclusionary conduct reasonably appears capable
   of making a significant contribution to creating or maintaining
   monopoly power, we will not hesitate to act.

   <p>The strong appellate decision in Microsoft re-confirms that improper
   conduct by firms with monopoly power can give rise to substantial
   antitrust issues. The Commission will not back away from these types
   of cases, but they must be economically and factually sound. For
   example, in the U-Haul case that we brought in 1985, the complaint
   alleged that U-Haul and its parent AMERCO attempted to monopolize the
   market for rental moving equipment by engaging in a series of
   anticompetitive acts against a competitor in a Chapter 11
   reorganization proceeding, Jartran, and that the respondents "in fact
   injured competition by jeopardizing and substantially delaying
   Jartran's emergence as a reorganized company, capable of resuming its
   role as an effective competitor."

   <h>D. Process Issues

   <p>We have always had a problem at the FTC with the speed and efficiency
   of non-HSR investigations. Unlike HSR, we do not have a statutory
   clock that pushes such cases. I have directed Joe Simons to develop
   and implement new procedures and controls. We want our non-merger
   enforcement activities to be "timely, likely and efficient."

                       <h>V. Non-Enforcement Initiatives

   <p>One of the best innovations of the Pitofsky Commission was to be
   active in holding public hearings and workshops on substantial
   consumer protection and competition-related issues affecting the
   American economy. These proceedings help us develop a better
   understanding of new economic and business developments, and their
   consumer-related implications, in a non-adversarial process, and are
   useful to the Commission, the Congress, and others, by informing
   policy and possibly future enforcement decisions. We have already
   continued the practice of sponsoring these proceedings with our just
   concluded conference on Gasoline Prices last week.There will be
   follow-up hearings on this issue over the next several months, and we
   will have similar hearings on other antitrust and consumer protection
   issues over the next few years.

   <p>The FTC also has a long and distinguished history of being an advocate
   for competition and consumers in connection with federal, state, and
   local regulation. This is called our "Advocacy Program." We will be
   selective in choosing where to intervene - our resources do not permit
   us to be everywhere, nor would that make sense - but we will be
   active. In a related vein, we will look for suitable opportunities to
   be a competition policy advocate as an amicus curiae in private
   litigation. Those cases will be limited to situations where we can
   make a contribution on important legal issues.

                                <h> Conclusion

   <p>Protecting consumers is the purpose of the antitrust laws and the
   mission of the Federal Trade Commission. I fully support our mission
   and a vigorous pro-consumer antitrust enforcement agenda. The
   "stubborn facts" of our actions will not support the preconceptions of
   some that we are here to put the brakes on antitrust. I look forward
   to working with the ABA to ensure that our antitrust enforcement is
   the best it can be to protect American consumers.
