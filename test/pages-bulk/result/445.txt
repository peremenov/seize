<h>gapingvoid: cartoons drawn on the back of business cards

<h>September 30, 2004

<h>lucky's juice joint

   <p>There are a lot of great marketing books and blogs out there. That
   being said, I still think the best marketing stories come from
   personal, first-hand experience.

   <p>Here's a favorite one of mine:

     <p>Back when I lived in New York there was this fabulous, crazy-ass
     juice bar on West Houston called Lucky's Juice Joint. I think it's
     no longer there. I hear it's moved.

     <p>It was the most out-of-place business south of 14th Street. Hard to
     descibe, except as a "hardcore hippie haven". Just had this weird,
     crazy, psychedelic-rainforest vibe.

     <p>But damn, it had the best juice in town. It was amazing stuff.
     Tasted like the fruits and vegetables were picked that morning.
     Fresher than anything else I found in New York. And yes, I had
     searched high and low for even better alternatives, but never found
     one. In New York, this was really it.

     <p>The boss was this crazy looking tie-dye wearing guy who looked and
     talked like he had done too many drugs back in the 'sixties. A big
     ol' middle aged, acid-head teddy bear.

     <p>One day we struck up a brief conversation. I complimented the hell
     out of his product.

     <p>"Wow," I quietly gushed, "Your stuff is the best. It really is..."

     <p>"Sure it is," said the guy. "That's because we make it with
     reverence."

   <p>You don't have to get a job with a famous company or hot-shot industry
   in order to have a spectacular career. You just have to do what you do
   with reverence.

   
   <p>"Authenticity and reverence are two sides of the same coin."

   <p>Yes! Exactly!
   
<h>hughtrain ramble

   
  <h>"THE MARKET FOR SOMETHING TO BELIEVE IN IS INFINITE."

     <p>We are here to find meaning. We are here to help other people do
     the same. Everything else is secondary.

     <p>We humans want to believe in our own species. And we want people,
     companies and products in our lives that make it easier to do so.
     That is human nature...

   <p>Had some more thoughts, mostly disorganised ones:

   <p>: Bloggers are a fairly idealisitic bunch. When you talk about
   spirituality within a brand context they often get a bit twitchy. I
   guess some kind of self-imposed purity law is being messed with.

   <p>: Jack, a young Communications student from Australia wrote me today:

     <p>I'd like to see the future of advertising in blogs. I can see how
     they're part of it. But to be honest, I don't think I see the
     bigger picture.

   <p>So I write back:

     <p>Very few people can see the big picture, including those at the top
     of the industry.

     <p>The Communications industry can't see the big picture because it
     doesn't yet have a mechanism to handle Chaos Theory.

   <p>Worse than that, it doesn't have any business models that allow them
   to do what they do cheaply. They only have expensive models. All those
   mouths to feed, all those executive golf club memberships to pay for
   etc etc.

   <p>You know that celeb on that TV show you watch? You know, the one with
   the fancy-schmancy lifestyle your long-sufferring wife spends all her
   time enviously reading about in the tabloids?

   <p>Where does the celeb gets the means to buy all that cool stuff?

   <p>That's right. From your paycheck. Her money comes from you. Because
   the money that pays for her TV appearances comes from advertisers, who
   get their money from you when you go to Wal-Mart and buy their
   products that you saw advertised on your celeb pal's TV show the night
   before.

   <p>Nice to see all that hard-earned money you take home from the job at
   the paper mill going to help such worthy causes, like a new beach
   house in Malibu etc.

   <p>Big Media Celebrity Worship is corporate feudalism at its finest. The
   little people paying for the big people. I think it's cute.

<h>not drunk


<h>nothing to say

<h>how dare you have ideas

<h>mark love
   <p>"Mark Love. Basically a Love Mark in reverse."

   <p>A "Love Mark" is a newish, faddish term for a brand that commands a
   disproportionatley high amount of love and respect from the people who
   use it. You could say Apple and Harley Davidson were two classic
   examples.

   <p>OK, so...

   <p>A Mark Love is basically a term for a product that was made with a
   disproportionately high amount of love and respect for the end user.

   <p>Unlike the Love Mark, it's not about what the consumer thinks of the
   product. It's about what you think of the consumer, and how your
   product acts as a conduit to express that. It's 180 degrees from the
   Love Mark.The energy travels from the product (i.e. you) to the end
   user, not the other way around.

   <p>It's about Values. Purpose. Belief. Integrity. Compassion. All that
   good stuff.

   <p>You'll notice a lot of Love Marks started life out as Mark Loves
   first.

   <p>Ergo:

   <p>( Step 1) Create the Mark Love and (Step 2) the Love Mark will soon
   follow.

   <p>You want the lady in the shopping mall to love your product? Easy.
   Love her first.

   <p>The trouble arises when companies want to get to Step 2 before they've
   gotten to Step 1.

   <p>It's so frickin' obvious.

     <p>PS: This is a rewrite of the "Love Byte" post which was SO
     APPALLING I deleted it. However, some of you might be already
     picking it up on your RSS feeds. Sorry. Please ignore it. Thanks.

  
<h>bob the cab driver

   <p>About once a week, I have to catch the late train home. Bob the cab
   driver always meets me the station and drives me to my house.

   <p>Bobs got what Seth Godin calls The Free Prize. He's got what Tom
   Peters calls The Wow! Factor. He's got something I like that no other
   cab driver has. It might be his jovial manner, it might be I like the
   fact his car is colored red. It might be the fact that he's very
   reliable. The reason doesn't matter so much. Regardless, Bob gets my
   business 100% of the time. When he can't make it I let his brother
   pick me up instead, but that doesn't happen too often. I call no other
   cab service but Bob's. There are a lot of cab companies where I live.
   Cab driving is a pretty commodified buisness. But I call Bob. Every
   time. I like Bob.

   <p>The minute he pisses me off for whatever reason Ill find another cab
   driver I like just as much.

   <p>Just found this old one, floating around the net somewhere. Heh.
   
<h>non-commodified


   <p>Back in the 60s and 70s, Received Wisdom would say that a computer
   company should make both main bits of the machine- the hardware and
   software. IBM, Digital etc all followed this model.

   <p>But 25 or so years ago Microsoft asked themselves one of the best
   questions ever in the history of business:

   <p>If hardware was free, how would Microsoft make a living?

   <p>They had seen the writing on the wall. They saw hardware (i.e. the
   white boxes and circuit boards that make up PCs) eventually becoming a
   commodity. They looked into the future, and saw the price do nothing
   but go down.

   <p>And this was years before hardware became commodified. They decided
   software was where the action was; theyd let companies like Dell or
   Toshiba worry about the ever-commodifying molecules. They would just
   focus exclusively on the bit that would retain its value over time
   i.e. the software.

   <p>Apple didnt spot this. Apple held on to hardware.

   <p>Apple nearly went under.

   <p>Microsoft became one of the biggest companies in the world.

   <p>Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.

   <p>So heres my question to my fellow advertising folk, in the same vein:

   <p>If they made advertising illegal overnight, how would your company
   make a living?

   <p>Seriously. Any fool company can come up with a decent campaign brief.
   Any fool company can produce an award-winning TV commercial.

   <p>Thats no longer where the value is. Like computer hardware, that part
   of the business has become commodified. The real long-term,
   non-commodified value is elsewhere.

   <p>So wheres the non-commodified part? Seriously.

   <p>I have an idea. It's very exciting.
   
<h>love is viral

   <p>You ask folk to name some brands that really resonate with them, what
   Saatchi & Saatchi's would call a Lovemark.

   <p>So they rattle off a list: Reebok, Bluetooth, Mercedes, Apple, Captain
   Bennys Seafood Restaurant, Typepad, whatever

   <p>Usually, they list around a dozen. Then they lose interest and the
   coversation tails off.

   <p>The average person with a decent job (i.e. with money to spend on your
   product) interacts with around 40 thousand brands, and even thats a
   conservative estimate.

   <p>12 out of 40,000. So even if the person buys your product, you brand
   has about a 0.0003% chance of being a Love Mark with them.

   <p>Anyone who enters a market thinking to beat those odds is a fool.

   <p>Advice to marketeers: Stop worrying about whether people you dont know
   love your brand or not. Stop worrying about if your brand conforms to
   some vague ideal in a business/marketing book written by a clever guy
   youve never met. Worry instead about how much you and the people you
   know, love and respect love it. I mean REALLY love it. Be brutally
   honest.

   <p>If you and yours dont love it, nobody else will. If you and yours do
   love it, others will.

   <p>Love is viral, indifference isnt. Its that simple.

<h>faq


  <l> 1. Do you mind me posting your work on my website?
   <p>Not at all. Just as long as it's properly credited, unaltered (yes,
   you can alter the size to fit your site, no worries) and links back to
   gapingvoid. Check my Creative Commons License for more info. Also, I'd
   rather you make a copy of the images and host them on your own server
   rather than "stealing" my bandwidth. But if you can't do that for
   whatever reason, then go ahead and "hotlink". I'm not too fussy about
   it, to be honest. If you want your stuff to be read, then you have to
   make allowances etc.

   <l>2. I really want a certain image on a blogcard. Could you make it for
   me?
   <p>Sorry, no. Blogcards don't make enough money for individual
   commissions. In fact, I make no money from them. Everything is
   ploughed right back into paying for bandwidth. I just publish them
   mostly for the fun of it. That being said, I plan to be adding new
   designs to the stable, so if you have a favorite one, feel free to
   drop me an e-mail.

   <l>3. Are all your drawings drawn on the back of business cards?
   <p>Yes and no. I draw some of them on other people's printed cards, but
   mostly I draw on blank pieces of high quality bristol board, cut to
   business card size. This goes back to the early days when instead of
   handing out my company's business cards, I would just make a wee
   doodle on a blank card with my contact details on the back. People
   remebered it more, somehow. So blank cards have always been "business
   cards" to me. Depends how you want to define it.

   <l>4. Are you a full time cartoonist?
   <p>No. It's just a hobby.

   <l>5. Are you married?
   <p>No. Very single at the moment. Never been married. No kids to my
   knowledge, either.

   <l>6. What's your day job?
   <p>I'm a "blogvertising" consultant.

   <l>7. I'm new to gapingvoid. What should I check out first?
   <p>This is what I generally point people to:

   <p>History of the cartoon-bizcard format, plus a list of
   my dozen or so sentimental favorite cartoons, with the story of how
   each one came into being.

   <p>"The market for something to believe in is infinite." A
   rant about the new realities of marketing.
<p>Tips that have worked for me over the years. The
   book proposal is here.

   <p>"The creative person basically has two kinds of
   jobs: One is the sexy, creative kind. Second is the kind that pays the
   bills. Sometimes the task in hand covers both bases, but not often.
   This tense duality will always play center stage. It will never be
   transcended."

   <p>Before I got into this whole blogging thing, I posted about
   400 drawings on an old-fashioned website. Worth checking out.

   <l>7. What do you look like?
   <p>Some wonderfully unflattering pics of me are here.

<h>you think TV is tedious?



     <p>"The consumers who make the biggest difference (the busy ones, the
     ones who earn a lot, spend a lot, vote, talk a lot and change
     things) are the ones most likely to be online and least likely to
     watch TV."

  <p> You think TV is tedious? You should see the people who work in it.

   <p>As a cartoonist, I prefer blogging to publishing in old media. I like
   the total control. I like the one-on-one.

   <p>Careerwise, I meet far more interesting people via blogging than I
   ever did working in TV or Madison Avenue.

   <p>ALLEGORY: The difference between blogging and mass-media cartooning is
   like the difference between a glass of whisky in front of a fire with
   an old friend, and talking to a hundred random people in a nightclub.
 
<h>dream job

   <p>Somebody recently asked me what my dream job would be.

   <p>Being a professional cartoonist is not it. I absolutely loathe the
   bunker-dwelling lifestyle. I absolutely despise the market most
   cartoonists have to schlep in.

   <p>Being a conventional advertising copywriter is also not it. Most
   copywriters are uninspired hacks with only a small bag of smartass
   tricks separating themselves and oblivion. Very few of them bring any
   seriously original thinking to their clients problems. And very few
   clients ask copywriters for serious thinking as a result. They ask
   other people instead.

  <p> My dream job would be to somehow combine the two.

   <p>My dream job would be to license my drawing style to a company. I
   would draw them cartoons related to their business. On a deeper level
   I would apply The Hughtrain to their branding and their business.

   <p>My contribution would be to give them a very unique voice with which
   to express their brand essence, which would also be informed by my
   rather ahead-of-the-curve brand and marketing theories.

   <p>It would have to be the right company, though. A company with a great
   product, great people, a great corporate culture, and deep enough
   pockets to pay my salary.

   <p>If you know anybody, please forward this page to them. Thanks.

   <p>and others tell me the tech market is coming back. I'm
   thinking if I move again, it'll be to San Francisco, where people who
   have the same crazy kind of ideas as me seem to congregate.

   <p>Watch this space.

<h>book outline

   <p>I'm turning "How To Be Creative" into a book. Here is the rough
   outline for the publishing folk etc.

  

   <h>"The Sex & Cash Theory: How To Be Creative In A Non-Creative World"

   <p>"Sex & Cash" is a book about how to deal with the creative bug
   properly without it ruining your life.

   <p>The book will have about 15-30 thousand words. It will be small and
   thick; I'm thinking 5 x 8 inches. Mixed in with the main text will be
   hundreds of my cartoons, which will compliment the writing.

   <p>The Pitch: "Seth Godin meets Edward Gorey". You either get it or you
   don't.

   <p>Introduction: "The best way to get approval is not to need it." This
   is the central message of the book. A lot of people daydream about
   living the creative life, about being a writer, artist, whatever, even
   if they don't really have anything to say or really want to do the
   actual work. This book is not for them. This book is for people who
   already have a few ideas of their own, who may already be well on
   their way, but maybe could use a wee push. It's not an instruction
   manual. It just shows where some of the land mines are buried, and
   gives direct and unapologetic advice on how to avoid stepping on them.

   <p>It will be very different from the usual touchy-feely "Personal
   Creativity" fare. It'll have a bit more bite to it. It will not try to
   romantisize the creative life, nor try to convert people to living it.
   The aim is not to make the reader feel comforted, validated or make it
   all seem easier than it actually is. The main thesis of the book is
   just to get on with it; that only when one has dropped all those
   clichéd romantic daydreams about being creative, does the world
   actually start paying attention, do things actually start moving
   forward.

   <p>The book introduction will have similar to the preceding two
   paragraphs.

   <p>The book has four main sections:

   <p>Section 1. The Sex & Cash Theory: 500 words. "The creative person
   basically has two kinds of jobs: One is the sexy, creative kind.
   Second is the kind that pays the bills. Sometimes the task in hand
   covers both bases, but not often. This tense duality will always play
   center stage. It will never be transcended." (full text here...)

   <p>Section 2. Cartoons drawn on the back of business cards. 3,000 words.
   An introduction to my work, and the story behind how the cartoon
   format came into being. It'll also show a few of my sentimental
   favorite cartoons, and the stories of how they came into being.

     <p>"All I had when I first got to Manhattan were 2 suitcases, a couple
     of cardboard boxes full of stuff, a reservation at the YMCA, and a
     10-day freelance copywriting gig at a Midtown advertising agency.

     <p>My life for the next couple of weeks was going to work, walking
     around the city, and staggering back to the YMCA once the bars
     closed. Lots of alcohol and coffee shops. Lot of weird people.
     Being hit five times a day by this strange desire to laugh, sing
     and cry simultaneously. At times like these, there's a lot to be
     said for an art form that fits easily inside your coat pocket..."
     

   <p>Section 3. The Master List. 25-50 short chapters about absolutely
   everything I know on the subject of handling the creative process and
   the creative life. A few hundred words per chapter. Approx 10,000
   words in total. 

     <l>1. Ignore everybody.

     <l>2. The idea doesn't have to be big. It just has to change the
     world.

     <l>3. Put the hours in.

     <l>4. If your biz plan depends on you suddenly being "discovered" by
     some big shot, your plan will probably fail.

     <l>5. You are responsible for your own experience.

     <l>6. Everyone is born creative; everyone is given a box of crayons in
     kindergarten.

     <l>7. Keep your day job.

     <l>8. Companies that squelch creativity can no longer compete with
     companies that champion creativity.

     <l>9. Everybody has their own private Mount Everest they were put on
     this earth to climb.

     <l>10. The more talented somebody is, the less they need the props.

     <l>11. Don't try to stand out from the crowd; avoid crowds altogether.

     etc. etc.

     <p>Section 4. Epilogue: Now quit futzing around and go do it. 500-1000
     words.

     <p>"The pain of making the necessary sacrifices always hurts more than
     you think it's going to. I know. It sucks. That being said, doing
     something seriously creative is one of the most amazing experiences
     one can have, in this or any other lifetime. If you can pull it
     off, it's worth it. Even if you don't end up pulling it off, you'll
     learn many incredible, magical, valuable things. It's NOT doing it
     when you know you full well you HAD the opportunity- that hurts FAR
     more than any failure..."

     <p>Well, it's a start. I'll keep you posted etc.
<h>greedcandy

   <p>:Yes, another spike shoved my bandwidth above its quota late last
   night and caused my site to be down for 8 hours. I've sorted it out
   with my webmaster. It shouldn't happen again, he said, reaching for
   his checkbook.

   <p>: Another diamond from Seth Godin:

     <p>In a world where things are viral, you're more likely to succeed
     with passive networking (strangers recommending you) than the old
     school active kind. In other words, make great stuff, do your
     homework, build your audience and when you've got something worth
     talking about, people will talk about it.

   <p>I love this guy. "Passive Networking". What a stunningly great term
   from a stunningly great paragraph.

   <p>: Tom Peters' new blog is ferociously good. There's a reason why he
   gets the big bucks. My pet name for fun, motivational writings about
   business is "Greedcandy". It's a bit cynical, but hey, it was coined
   by me, so go figure...

  <p> Anyway, Tom and Seth are my two favorite Greedcandy folk at the
   moment.  Though I'm thinking Evelyn Rodriguez is getting damn
   close to stealing their crowns. Her stuff already goes beyond them
   both in a lot of ways.

   <p>Hear that, Tom? You've got serious competition for a change ;-)

<h>young adam DVD

   <p>"The best Scottish movie ever. An utter masterpiece of seething,
   beat-novel-film-noir sexuality." - Hugh MacLeod

     <p>Ewan McGregor, Tilda Swinton, Peter Mullan, Emily Mortimer etc.

     <p>Opened in USA April 16th, 2004

  

   <p>Been a while since I pimped Young Adam.

   <p>The DVDs are out, so if you haven't seen it yet, well, your loss.

   <p>Frankly, I'd recommend the NC-17/X-rated British version. Scenes were
   cut in the American version to make it fit the R-Rating.

   
<h>fun new biz model

   <p>The corporate business model of the (very near) future is childishly
   simple to understand. Nike, Dell and Coca Cola already use it, and
   most big companies are gearing up to implement it ASAP.

   <p>THE FUN NEW BIZ MODEL:

   <p>The company is divided into two parts, Part A and Part B.

   <p>Part A is much, much smaller than part B. Part B is huge.

   <p>Part A is called "Creative".

   <p>Part B is called "Outsourced."

   <p>So, are you creative or are you outsourced?
  
<h>September 21, 2004

<h>upstreaming

   <p>Im very interested in what is called upstreaming; one of those pesky
   buzzwords currently en vogue.

   <p>Upstreaming basically means moving up the value chain.

   <p>As a cartoonist, a good definition would be upstreaming from selling
   $25 cartoons to newspapers, to selling million-dollar movie ideas
   based on your cartoon character. Or in my case, upstreaming from
   showing free cartoons on the net, to selling my advertising services
   to one of my readers who has a business needing sold to a large
   audience.

   <p>The whole frickin advertising businesses is currently going through a
   turbulent upstreaming phase at the moment.

   <p>A lot of the things ad agencies are used to selling to their clients
   are not nearly as rare or valuable as they once were. And the people
   in the cubes doing the work are finding themselves less and less
   valued.

   <p>An art director I know was laid off from Ogilvy's in New York about 2
   years ago. Hes had a very hard time. His current situation is a total
   disaster. Hes 40 years old. Before the layoff his career had been less
   than spectacular.

   <p>Forget to upstream and you end up like him: middle aged and crashing
   on a friends couch in The Bronx.
  
<h>history of chess pieces

   <p>Chess pieces move the way they do for a reason:

   <p>A drunk Scottish guy in a pub told me this story. Fisk away.

   <p>Chess pieces are wee representations of ancient warfare.

   <p>1. Pawns. Foot soldiers. They were ordered to advance, fight to the
   death, and never retreat. Manoeuvring a phalanx of them in any
   direction other than forwards was pretty much impossible until the
   advent of the highly trained, highly drilled professional soldier,
   which didn't appear until much later with the Romans.

   <p>2. Knights. In ancient times, Calvary never advanced head on, but
   flanked i.e. they went around the back and attacked at the side.

   <p>3. Rooks. The original chess rooks were not castles, but war
   elephants. Elephants are fairly unstoppable once they get going, but
   not very manoeuvrable. Hence they can go in straight lines- forward,
   backward, left, right- but little else. In ancient times war elephants
   carried little castles on their backs, from which archers would fire
   down (think Lord of the Rings). Europe has no elephants, but does have
   castles. So the latter caught on.

   <p>4. Bishops. Chess predates Christianity in Europe. The original bishop
   pieces were actually sailing ships. Sailing ships never go straight,
   but tack to the left or right i.e. diagonal. The sail of the ship
   resembles the bishops crown. The bishops's crown was stylistically
   adopted in Europe during the Dark Ages, as Chistianity spread and
   naval warfare went into decline after the fall of the Roman Empire.

   <p>5. The Queen. The Queens entourage was always looked after by a small,
   elite, highly trained bodyguard. The imperative to protect the women
   and children was very strong. If trouble was afoot it needed to get
   the hell out of Dodge very quickly. Ergo the bodyguard was very mobile
   and very deadly. It needed to be.

   <p>6. The King, though powerful and free to choose any direction he
   wanted, was heavily laden with the apparatus of state. The King could
   not just drop everything and flee; he had the court, the treasury and
   the ministers weighing him down. So his movements were fairly limited.
 
<h>there is no silver bullet

   
   <p>More thoughts on "How To Be Creative":

     <l>26. Write from the heart.

    <p> There is no silver bullet. There is only the love God gave you.

   <p>As a professional writer, I am interested in how conversation scales.

   <p>How communication scales, x to the power of n etc etc.

   <p>Ideally, if youre in the communication business, you want to say the
   same thing, the same way to an audience of millions that you would to
   an audience of one. Imagine the power youd have if you could pull it
   off.

   <p>But sadly, it doesnt work that way.

   <p>You cant love a crowd the same way you can love a person.

   <p>And a crowd cant love you the way a single person can love you.

   <p>Intimacy doesnt scale. Not really. Intimacy is a one-on-one
   phenomenon.

   <p>It's not a big deal. Whether youre writing to an audience of one,
   five, a thousand, a million, ten million, theres really only one way
   to really connect. One way that actually works:

   <p>Write from the heart.

   <p>There is no silver bullet. There is only the love God gave you.

<h>they are no longer customers, they are now consumers

   <p>A startup I know just got big and sexy. Now the people doing the
   actual work are pissed off because suddenly the management are
   starting to believe their own publicity. Suddenly the fancy-talk
   consultants are moving in. Suddenly for the first time the CEO is
   closing the door to his office so his underlings cant hear him talking
   with the recently-hired marketing guys.

   <p>Suddenly all transparency went out the window. This is amusing because
   the actual product is all about making their corporate clients more
   transparent.

   <p>Suddenly plain speaking went out the window. This is amusing because
   the actual product is all about making their corporate clients more
   plain speaking.

   <p>Suddenly the workers no longer feel theyre part of something, except
   perhaps making their bosses rich.

   <p>The early adapters who first used the product with relish and spread
   the word during the company's infancy are no longer appreciated, nor
   is their feedback actively sought any more. They were useful once, but
   now they have served their purpose. They're now told to go back and
   get in line with the rest of the plebes. They are no longer customers,
   they are consumers.

   <p>We both already know how this story is going to end.

   <p>Part of my current job is helping prevent companies from falling into
   this trap.

   <p>Feel free to write me if you wish to know more:

<h>some things get harder, some things get easier

   <p>A few years ago, the ad agency I worked for in New York was sold to
   Euro RSCG, the international advertising conglomerate.

   <p>The week of the paper being signed, the entire agency was crowded into
   this big room, and the then CEO of Euro RSCG, Bob Schmetterer, our new
   boss, gave us this big pep talk. We were part of this big global
   future that was happening or whatever.

   <p>Fair enough. I kinda saw the vision. It made sense, sorta, at least
   from a senior management position. We grunts were less sure, but since
   when are grunts sure about anything senior management gets up to?

   <p>So Bob opened the floor to questions. Nobody really had any, which I
   thought was odd. So to break the awkward silence I raised my hand.

   <p>In time of great change, I asked, some things get harder, some things
   get easier, and the harder bit is usually where the money is. What's
   the hardest part of your job now?

   <p>Getting people on board, said Bob. Not everybody gets it.

   <p>In times of great change, some things get harder, some things get
   easier. Concentrate on the former, because thats where the money is. I
   still use that thought with my clients today.

   <p>I guess what interests me about any business is the hard parts. The
   easy parts are always overcrowded, underpaid and quietly dying.
 
<h>September 19, 2004

<h>power is never given. power is taken.

   <p>Artists, both famous and unknown, spend a lot of time waiting around
   for "The Big Yes Moment" to arrive. The moment where they get the
   greenlight. The moment where the publisher, producer, whatever finally
   calls him/her up and goes "Yes!"

   <p>Yes! You are no longer pond scum. Welcome to the happy, shiny, Holy
   Order of Non-Failure. Yes! Yes!

   <p>Yes! We're going to make your movie! Yes! We're going to publish your
   novel! Yes! We're going to give you a show!

   <p>Yes! Yes! Yes!

   <p>Go to any art opening, film screening or book launch in New York,
   Paris, London, Tokyo etc. The place is full of these people- artists
   killing time, drinking the free wine, working the room, trying to hide
   their fear and doubt, trying not to look desperate, trying to look
   like players, trying to feign relevance, trying to be as interesting
   and confident and amusing and networked as possible, all waiting
   around till their Big Yes Moment hopefully one day lands on their lap
   from an unknown direction. It doesn't matter if they're a 20-year-old
   art student or a 50-year-old Oscar Nominee. Their palpable unease
   carries the same vibe.

   <p>Some lame-ass myth exists that if you're talented, hard working, savvy
   and networked enough, then one day power will be given to you.

   <p>It doesn't happen like that. Power is never given. Power is taken.

   <p>Power comes from sovereignty.

   <p>So now you know.

<h>trogging

   <p>Coined a new term. Heh.

   <p>TROGGING: Trust + Blogging i.e. "Using Blogs to build trust and
   transparency."

   <p>It occurs to me that my opinion of Microsoft has risen considerably in
   the last year.

   <p>Not that I ever belonged to the "Bill Gates is Satan" crowd. I never
   was into computers enough to really care whether a guy in Redmond
   wrote the code, or some guy in Toledo. The same way I don't really
   care who made my telphone or my microwave, so long as it works. It's
   not an area where I project a lot of myself in to.

   <p>Still, there is something quite monolithic about Microsoft, and one
   always keeps an eyebrow raised when something gets that big, quite
   rightly.

   <p>So what happened? A new product? Nope. I still use the same Windows 98
   and creaky, old Dell as always. Great new advertising campaign? Nope.
   Not watching much TV these days. Bill Gates gave all his money to
   cancer research? Nope. Not seen that much mention of him in the media
   recently.

   <p>What happened in there's this guy called Robert Scoble who has a blog
   that I've been reading a lot this last 6-9 months. Robert works for
   Microsoft. Mark seems like a smart, honest, regular guy who holds down
   a job, same as the rest of us. He just happens to work for Microsoft.
   Robert writes about his job and his company the same way I would if I
   worked for them and liked my job. Informal, informed, friendly, it
   gives real insight about his company where possible- he tries to be as
   open and insightful as he can without disclosing trade secrets.

   <p>It other words, he seems sane, reasonable, trustworthy, human and
   somebody who knows what he's talking about. Which to me helps make
   Microsoft seem likewise.

   <p>One guy and his blog, doing more real good for his company than any
   multimillion dollar ad agency campaign could ever hope to achieve.

   <p>As somebody in the ad business, I find the implications staggering.

   <p>Long live Robert Scoble, King of the Troggers!

   <p>UPDATE: Rick Bruner shows what happens when a company (in this case,
   Kryptonite Bicycle Locks) doesn't "trog":

     <p>This is simply going to devistate Kryptonite. Too bad, I've always
     been a fan. Of course, this isn't principally a communication
     problem; it's a product problem. The only thing I could think that
     might save their business at this point would be a massive
     recall/refund for every customer with a U-lock. But this is also a
     communication problem. As a customer (I have four of their locks),
     I would really like to know whether this problem affect their other
     products, or whether it is limited to that Evolution 2000. But
     their communication on this sucks. The story broke online, yet
     there is nothing about it on their web site. They could really,
     really use a blog to try to contain the damage ASAP. But looking at
     their actions so far, I am not optimistic.

  <p> Can you imagine how much money Kryptonite would have saved if they
   only had the foresight to let one of their smarter writers keep a
   company blog?

  <p> Companies that "trog" will remain. Companies that don't will die. You
   heard it here first. Fire your ad agency. Hire a blogger who knows
   what he's doing.

   <p>NB: Yes, I know, "trogging" is a silly word. I'm not expecting it to
   catch on, frankly.

   <p>UPDATE: Rober Scoble spotted this post and gave it a wee mention.
   Thanks, Robert!
   
<h>my 10 best ideas


   <p>I work in the advertising and branding business, coming up with ideas.
   These are my sentimental favorites.

   <l>1. The Hughtrain: "The market for something to believe in is
   infinite."

   <l>2. Movie Blogvertising. I was the first ever to use blogs as form of
   advertising for a commericaly-released film, as far as I know. Maybe
   somebody beat me to it, but my radar hasn't caught it so far. [Update:
   Radar just caught it: This was the first. Heh. But at the time I
   didn't know of it.]

   <l>3. Seally Commerical: Killer Whale.

   <l>4. My Diet Coke Ad.

   <l>5. McDonald's. "Stay Hungry."

   <l>6. "Smarter Conversations". Kinda says it all.

   <l>7. "Blogcards".

   <l>8. "Aaaaagh! It's Mr Hell!"

   <l>9. The Kinetic Quality. "A brand is a place, not a thing."

   <l>10. "Quality is not job one." Life is suffering.

   <h>NOTES:

     <l>1. The Hughtrain: "The market for something to believe in is
     infinite."

     <p>"We are here to find meaning. We are here to help other people do
     the same. Everything else is secondary.

     <p>We humans want to believe in our own species. And we want people,
     companies and products in our lives that make it easier to do so.
     That is human nature..."

   <p>This seems ridiculously self-evident.

   <p>Marketing is mostly simple stuff. People just like to make it
   complicated in order to hide their fear.

     <l>2. Movie Blogvertising. I was the first ever to use blogs as form
     of advertising for a commericaly-released film, as far as I know.
     Maybe somebody beat me to it, but my radar hasn't caught it so far.


    <p>Taking on board what I've learned from blogging Young Adam, this is
     how I'd design a commercial blog for a big-budget movie.

     <l>1. I would keep the blog entries as short and sweet as possible.
     Movie goers have short attention spans.

     <l>2. I would post links to do with all the people invloved. If John
     Travolta was the star I would blog all the interesting stuff on him
     I could find. His love of flying airplanes or whatever. The blog
     would become as much an A-Grade source for Travolta information as
     it would for the film.

     <p>I would do likewise for all the other actors, and the director, and
     even the producer. The point of publicity is to make the recipient
     feel like he/she is getting real, juicy, insider info. A feeling
     not unlike the college student gets when the bouncer finally lets
     him in to the club.

     <p>"Make them feel like they're getting behind the velvet rope" etc.

     <l>3. I would keep on hammering away on why I think it's a good movie.
    I would never let them forget I think it's a good movie. Ever.

     <l>4. If the movie was getting any "buzz", I'd report on that too.

     <l>5. I would make sure the blog had an authentic voice. Of course, if
     it's a great movie my job is easier. If the movie is a total dud, I
     would dig deeper in order to find whatever merit I could.

     <p>The way to do that, obviously, is not to compare it with Citizen
     Kane. Better to realize that even a mediocre movie has a good story
     behind it- the combined results of millions of dollars and
     roomfulls of smart, driven people. Try to find the brightest people
     on the project and try to bring their energy in to the equation.
     Even if it's the worst movie ever, there might be some amazingly
     wonderful person working in the costume department or whatever. Try
     to tap into that side of things.

     <l>6. Talk about the actual business. Perhaps explain to people the
     compelxities of a distribution deal or whatever. Try to make them
     see where the movie fits within a billion dollar industry.
     Cultivate intrigue. Again, people want to be 'insiders', it's
     hard-wired into our systems to want to belong to the Alpha Group.
     Get them beind the velvet rope, any way you can.

     <l>7. Start early. To build awareness of the movie properly needs at
     least least a year, preferably two. It's not about telling millions
     of people at once. You talk to a few thousand at a time. Let the
     word spread gradually. Give it time to seep into the Zeitgeist,
     like absinthe on a sugar cube.

     <l>8. Buy media. Word-of-mouth is good, but not always reliable. Buy
     the means to drive the necessary eyeballs to your site, and charge
     it to your client at an honest profit to yourself.

     <l>9. Allow comments. Let your readers contribute, the more the
     better- it builds interactivity, word-of-mouth, and most
     importantly, credibiltiy. That being said, have no qualms about
     deleteing rude ones and banning ISP addresses. "Trolls" are never
     helpful. Be prepared to police your blog vigilantly.

     <l>10. All this is in vain without some kernel of intellectual honesty
     informing your every action.

     <l>3. Seally Commerical: Killer Whale.

   <p>Documentary footage: A seal is napping on an ice flow. Suddenly a
   killer whale pops up from beneath the water, violently grabs the seal
   in his jaws and disappears under the waves with his hapless prey.

   <p>VOICE OVER: The world is not a place for the half-awake etc.

   <p>Repositioning a mattress as a competitive Darwinian tool. Exactly.

     <l>4. My Diet Coke Ad.

   <p>No messing around.

     <l>5. McDonald's. "Stay Hungry."

   <p>I sadly never sold this idea. I had the thought that if McDonlad's
   wanted to get serious about turning their fortunes around, they should
   tap into more of that entrepreneurial energy of their founder, Ray
   Kroc. It was a good tagline, though. The commercials I wrote weren't
   bad, either.

     <l>6. "Smarter Conversations". Kinda says it all.

     <l>7. "Blogcards".

   <p>Blogcards are fun. They allow people to hand out their details without
   having to be too formal about it. They also spread the word about my
   work in a fairly undemanding manner. Molecular viral marketing, as it
   were.

   <p>I don't make money on them. All profits get ploughed back into paying
   for this website. But they seem to make people happy. That's more than
   enough.

     <l>8. "Aaaaagh! It's Mr Hell!" A half hour BBC cartoon show based on
     one of my cartoon characters. Ran on the BBC, Showtime in the US,
     ran in Canada, Australia etc etc.

   <p>OK, yeah, this isn't really an "advertising" thing. But the producer
   of the show was an old advertising buddy of mine, who quit Madison
   Avenue to try his luck in the TV business.

   <p>Payment for TV folk being as pathetic as it is, we never expected to
   make much money from it. We hope maybe down the road there could be a
   merchandising thing, which is worth a lot more. So the TV program's
   main benefit to its creators is as an advertisement for a Mr Hell
   T-shirt or whatever. So it really is about advertising after all. Ha!

   <p>It didn't quite work out that way. TV is a nightmare. You have been
   warned.

     <l>9. The Kinetic Quality. "A brand is a place, not a thing."

   <p>You have to be careful about Brand Theory. Once it starts creeping out
   of your mouth you start turning into this very scary person. You have
   been warned.

     <l>10. "Quality is not job one." Life is suffering.


<h>rebundling content


   <p>on the bundling and rebundling of
   content:

     <p>These bundling strategies are not stable of themselves, they exist
     only within the context of technology, distribution and transaction
     costs surrounding them. When these change, bundles may collapse.
     The CD is the obvious example. With individual digitized songs now
     easier to duplicate and distribute than the physical bundle, the
     albums raison d'etre has disappeared. As the simple playlist
     replaces the album's remaining value of simplifying choice, CDs
     commence a slow glide to oblivion, moderated only by the installed
     base of equipment and consumer habit.

  

     <p>If the network or the newspaper or the magazine or the cable system
     was the old bundle, the internet itself is the new bundle: In this
     medium of extreme control, we each put together whatever bundle we
     want...

     <p>This accelerates the commoditization of content. It also provides
     opportunities for those who can add value (and convenience and
     perspective and even fun)... In this new distributed, unbundled,
     post-marketplace, molecular, commoditized media world, value can be
     added in many ways. It's about relationships. It's about relevancy.
     It's about service. It's about uniqueness. It's about perspective.

   <p>My two cents: A friend of mine just got laid off from his high-paying
   editorial job at FHM. He's 37. His bosses figured they could get a 26
   year old to do the job a lot cheaper. They were right, of course.

   <p>Every non-executive media, publishing and advertising person I know is
   hurting. But I don't expect the pain levels to ever decrease, for
   reasons Tim and Jeff talked about.

   <p>Even worse, a lot of these folk live in "media center" cities like New
   York or London that, unlike the prices they command for their
   services, never get cheaper.

   <p>i.e. their jobs are worth less and less every day, the towns they live
   in get more and more expensive to live in every day. It's
   unsustainable.

   <p>We media/advertising/content folk are supposed to be "creative". Yet
   we're very uncreative when it comes to thinking about our business
   models differently. We still expect management to take care of that
   aspect for us, in exchange for allowing our "creativity" to be
   squeezed like lemons. Management knows we're screwed, knows we're
   stuck, knows we're desperate, so they squeeze harder. I would do the
   same. So would you.

   <p>Like I said in "How To Be Creative", all existing business models are
   wrong. Find a new one.

<h>start-agains

   <p>Just added the following blurb to The Hughtrain:

     <p>Theres only one thing harder than starting a new business:
     Re-inventing an old one.

     <p>Start-ups are fine and dandy, most people reading this will know
     all about them.

     <p>But what about Start-agains? Are they an exercise in futility or a
     tremendous opportunity?

     <p>THOUGHT: the future of advertising is clients increasingly asking
     their agencies to help re-invent not just their brands, but their
     actual companies. The future is agencies being increasingly unable
     to deliver on this.

     <p>Out of this wreckage a new industry will emerge...

<h>tom peter's rant

   <p>A wonderful rant from Tom Peters, courtesy of the ever life-affirming
   Halley Suitt.

   <p>Tom's latest book, "Re-imagine!" is wonderful. I cannot recommend it
   highly enough. Same goes for Halley's website.

     <p>tomAto, TOMaTO by Tom Peters
     New Delhi. Thirteen September 2004. I awoke, jetlagged and sweaty,
     at 3A.M. Id had a nightmare. Stark realism. I was, as usual,
     accused of overstatement and a few (or more) too many exclamation
     marks (!!!!!). Only this time Id acceded to They. The They who
     believe in The Plan and Built to Last and Continuous Improvement
     and Quiet, Humble Leaders. No! No! I had failed, in my dream, to
     live up to my Fervent Beliefs! This must not pass! In a sweat,
     fearful that the time would not come round again, I turned on the
     light, picked up a pad of paper, and began to scribble frantically.
     Herewith the result.

     <p>Toms Re-imagine Manifesto:

     <p>They say my (Tom) language is extreme.

     important.
     I say 9 out of 10, make that 99 out of 100, companies arent within
     striking distance of
     accurately estimating the potential of the Womens Market let alone
     exploiting it.

     <p>They say the boomer-geezer market is also doubtless important.
     I say the boomer-geezer market amounts to a Redefining Moment.

     <p>They say we need a project to exploit the women-boomer-geezer
     market.
     I say we need Total Strategic Realignment to exploit the
     Women-Boomer-Geezer
     Opportunity.

     <p>They say Wow is typical Tom.
     I say WOW is a Minimum Survival Requirement.

     <p>They say effective governance is important.
     I say bold-brash Boards that are representative of the market
     servedmore than a
     token woman or two and an empty seat for the forthcoming
     Hispanicare an
     Imperative. Now.

     <p>They say Plan it.
     I say DO IT.

     <p>They say We must speed things up.
     I say We must Radically change the Corporate Metabolism until
     Insane Urgency
     becomes a Sacrament.

     Webs)
     power allows-encourages such silly (until recently)
     visions-of-ubiquity to become
     reality, perhaps overnight.

     <p>They say we need happy customers.
     I say Give me pushy, needy, nasty, provocative customers.

     <p>They say healthcare, our biggest industry, is a mess.
     I say our hospitals, which kill over 100,000 patients a year, are
     part of a system that is a
     disgrace.

     I say Re-imagine the entire healthcare system NOW to focus on
     Prevention &

    <p> They say no child left behind.
     I say education is leaving ALL our children behind, as it is

     creativity-driven economy.

     <p>They say we need to bring effectiveness to the supply chain.
     I say we need an IS/IT/Best Sourcing revolution based on nothing
     less than an Entirely
     Original Vision of what organizations are and how they interact.

     <p>They say Globalization is a bumpy road.
     I say India and China and Asia in general are within two decades of
     running the show:
     Get ready or get trounced.

     <p>They say defense and consolidation are musts for a global game.
     I say encourage Offense, nurture a Generation (or 10) of
     Entrepreneurs, cherish
     Creativity & Risk-taking from primary school onwards and dont
     expect to be saved
     by a bunch of bulky, retro behemoths commanded by a phalanx of Old
     White Guys
     who think 30 minutes a day on the corporate treadmill is a fit
     defense against
     Revolution.

     <p>They say men.
     I say WOMEN.

     <p>They say Diversity is a good thing.
     I say Diversity is a Fresh Breath of Creative Air Absolutely
     Necessary for Economic

     Shit and Gets Up
     (VERY) Early and works Saturdays & Sundays.

     <p>They say offshoring is a blight.
     I say the Earth proved not to be the center of the Solar System and
     the USA is not the
     epicenter-in-perpetuity of the Earth and that we had best learn NOW
     to
     prosper and take pleasure in a dynamic, exciting, creative,
     multi-polar economic
     environment. (Damn it.)

     <p>They say Its a fright.
     I say Its a Helluva Ride.

     <p>They say its daunting.
     I say its a hoot.

     <p>They say Life is a marathon; husband your strength.
     I say Life is a sprint. Begin planning your World-beating Me Inc.
     start-up TODAY.

     <p>They say lifetime employment was a boon.
     I say lifetime employment was Indentured Servitude, modern-day
     Slavery.

    <p> They say safety net.
     I say I am my safety net; give me the Ownership Society. (And Im a
     lifelong Democrat.)

     I say Reward excellent failures. Punish mediocre successes.
     (Thanks, Phil Daniels.)

     <p>They say Eighty-hour weeks will kill you.
     I say Work 35-hour weeks, and the Chinese will kill you.

     <p>They say Install cost controls with teeth.
     I say Ha. Ha. Ha. Blow Up the existing enterprise and start with a
     Clean Sheet of
     Paper.

     <p>They say Install cost controls with teeth.
     I say Grow the Top Line.

     <p>They say Radical change takes a decade.
     I say Radical change takes a Minute. (See AA.)

     <p>They say Times are changing.
     I say Everything has already changed. Tomorrow is the First Day of
     Your Revolution
     or youre Toast.

     <p>They say We cant all be Anita Roddick or Maxine Clark or Stan Shih
     or Les Wexner or
     Jerry Yang.
     I say Why not?

    <p> They say We cant all be Revolutionaries.
     I say Why not?

     <p>They say We cant all be a Brand.
     I say Why not?

     <p>They say Beware the Hype.
     I say Been to China lately? Visited Infosys in Bangalore lately?

     <p>They say this is just a Rant.
     I say this is just Reality.

     <p>They say The man is not nice.
     I say The times are not forgiving.

   <p>The issue isn't whether Tom's ideas are right. They are. The issue is
   whether the place you work will allow you to take them on board.
   
<h>double the conversations


   <p>I really, really like Seth Godin's basic take on marketing. To him,
   there are only two questions worth asking:

     <l>1. Whos talking about your product?
     <l>2. What are they saying?

   <p>Two very simple questions. Both are hard as hell to answer honestly.
   Any kind of honesty is hard as hell. Were hardwired to be deluded.

   <p>Another gem from him:

     <p>"Its all marketing now. The organizations that win will be the ones
     that realize that all they do is create things worth talking
     about."

   <p>Again, it's really simple stuff. But simple stuff often scares us.

   <p>80% of one of my former client's business is word-of-mouth. I once
   argued the case that if we could double the amount of conversations
   people were having about the product, sales will go up by 60% (80%
   doubled equals 160%, i.e. a 60% increase etc).

   <p>So my team came up with some ideas that made it MUCH easier for
   customers to have random conversations about the product with other
   people. It wasn't rocket science, I assure you.

   <p>She didn't buy the idea. She was shopping for rocket science that day,
   not plain speaking. Whatever.

   <p>Frankly, I think the idea of people actually talking about her product
   without her marketing team there to intervene like rabid pit bulls
   kinda terrified her.

   <p>We live in interesting times...

<h>advertise on gapingvoid


   <p>I've been a keen advocate of Blogads for a while, now they're on
   gapingvoid as well.

   <p>If you have something worth sharing with my readers, feel free to
   click the link at the bottom of the "blogvertising" adstrip, or go
   here.

   <p>My stats: I'm currently getting around 5000 visits a day, often more.
   A lot of my audience are people interested in advertising and
   marketing. I also get a lot of random hipster traffic because of the
   cartoons. I get a lot of creative folk because of my "How to be
   Creative" schpiel. I'm read by a lot of journalists, for some reason.
   I also get a lot of "A-Listers" coming to visit, which often triples
   my traffic (Thanks, Guys!).

   <p>My Google Page Rank is a "7", which makes my site's "link universe"
   comparable to other large blogs like adrants, joi.ito.com,
   buzzmachine.com etc.

   <p>Since gapingvoid got pretty well known my bandwidth costs have gone
   through the roof. The blogads are a way to hopefully pay for them. I
   didn't use blogads before because I didn't think my traffic was high
   enough to warrant using them. Now I do.

   <p>Hmmmm.... anything else I'm leaving out?

<h>fragmentation of fashion

 
   <p>Britton Monasco writes about "The Fragmentation of Fashion" over at
   Corante. It's a good read.

   <p>My two cents: It's not just consumers have too much choice; it's that
   they've gotten too smart.

   <p>They know that $100 t-shirt cost $2 to make in The Phillipines. They
   know the supermodel is just as screwy, tedious and flawed as the rest
   of us.

   <p>They know there's a short, bald guy behind the curtain.

   <p>Dazzling them with your brand isn't as easy as it used to be. The
   bullshit detectors are a lot more powerful than when you were back
   getting your MBA.

   <p>And they're getting more powerful every day. You know that, I know
   that, to pretend otherwise is just stupid and wrong.

   <p>You no longer control the conversation, they do. All you can do is
   make products that enhance the conversation. That make the
   conversation interesting and wonderful.

   <p>It's what I said in The Hughtrain: "It's not just the product. People
   have to love the process as well."

   <p>i.e. It's not what you do, it's the way that you do it.

   <p>Markets are now faster and smarter than you are. Without belief and
   purpose, you have nothing.

<h>ad agencies: "their business models suck and they're expensive for what you
get."


   <p>My life has been completely governed by an e-mail exchange I had
   earlier in the year with Bob.

   <p>Bob is the Japanese brand director for a very large international
   brand. A famous one. You've heard of it. Bob is a very smart and
   talented guy.

   <p>At the time I was starting to really get into the whole Cluetrain
   thing. I was looking at the advertising industry as a whole, and not
   liking what I was seeing, frankly.

   <p>So I exchange a few e-mails on the subject with Bob over in Tokyo. I
   remember Bob writing back something in particular about ad agencies- I
   don't even have to look it up, I can easily recite it from memory: 

     <p>"Their business models suck and they're expensive for what you
     get."

  <p> There's the rub. Their business models do suck and they are indeed
   expensive for what you get. Bob is no fool.

   <p>So, my advertising friends, here's the new deal:

   <p>It's not about strategy.
   It's not about media.
   It's not about creative.

   <p>It's about having a business model that (a) doesn't suck and (b) isn't
   expensive for what you get.

   <p>I have a plan. Do you?
  
<h>September 11, 2004

<h>cut to the chase

   <p>One thing about using the business card as a primary medium is the
   small size forces you to to think about what you're saying. You don't
   have the space to waffle or ramble. You cut to the chase. The drawing
   above is a pretty good example, I guess. It tells a lot of story in
   few words.

   <p>I can't tell you how useful this has proved to me professionally. In
   mass-market advertising, both space and airtime are very expensive. So
   every sentence you cut out saves thousands of dollars of your client's
   money.

   <p>In a world of permanently fragmenting media, the market for "shorter"
   increases. The market for "longer" decreases. Artistically one could
   easily find that objectionable, but that doesn't change the actual
   market.

<h>"how to be creative" is done


   <p>"How To Be Creative" is done, finally.

   <p>25 entries, 10,000 words, 26 drawings. One very large thread.

   <p>Thanks to Everybody for reading it. Especially thanks for all the
   feedback you left in the comment section. It really helped.

   <p>Yeah, I'll tweak it and whatnot. But it's done.

   <p>Thanks again =)

   <p>PS: Yes, I have had some publishing conversations. Yes, I have an
   agent. Expect a book at some point. Nothing is set in stone yet. If
   you're a publisher, please feel free to get in touch with me. If you
   know anyone in publishing who might be interested, please e-mail them
   a link to this page. Thanks.

   <p>As well as books, there are other possibilites- postcards, stationery,
   t-shirts, posters etc etc.

   <p>Anyhow, yeah, so I'm looking for allies to turn gapingvoid into
   something bigger than just a website. Angel investors, VC money,
   publishing deals, I'm open to anything. Again, feel free to drop me a
   line if you have any ideas:

   <p>Thanks again. Rock on.
  
<h>you have to find your own schtick

   <p>More thoughts on "How To Be Creative":

     <l>25. You have to find your own schtick.
     <p>A Picasso always looks like Piccasso painted it. Hemingway always
     sounds like Hemingway. A Beethoven Symphony always sounds like a
     Beethoven's Symphony. Part of being a Master is learning how to
     sing in nobody else's voice but your own.

   <p>Every artist is looking for their big, definitive "Ah-Ha!" moment,
   whether they're a Master or not.

   <p>That moment where they finally find their true voice, once and for
   all.

   <p>For me, it was when I discovered drawing on the back of business
   cards.

   <p>Other, more famous and notable examples would be Jackson Pollack
   discovering splatter paint. Or Robert Ryman discovering all-white
   canvases. Andy Warhol discovering silkscreen. Hunter S Thompsonn
   discovering Gonzo Journalism. Duchamp discovering the Found Object.
   Jasper Johns discovering the American Flag. Hemingway discovering
   brevity. James Joyce discovering stream-of-conciousness prose.

   <p>Was it luck? Perhaps a little bit.

   <p>But it wasn't the format that made the art great. It was the fact that
   somehow while playing around with something new, suddenly they found
   themselves able to put their entire selves into it.

   <p>Only then did it become their 'schtick', their true voice etc.

   <p>That's what people responded to. The humanity, not the form. The
   voice, not the form.

   <p>Put your whole self into it, and you will find your true voice. Hold
   back and you won't. It's that simple.

<h>note to self: synapses

  
   <p>NOTE TO SELF:

   <p>Your job is no longer about selling. Your job is about firing off as
   many synapses in your clients brain as possible.

   <p>The more synapses that are fired off, the more dopamines are released.
   Dopamines are seriously addictive. The more dopamines you release, the
   more the client will come back for more. Your client thinks he is
   coming back to you for sane, rational, value-driven reasons. He is
   wrong. He is coming back to feed.

<h>under-employed

<h>cool-sounding

<h>lot of money

<h>dont worry about finding inspiration

   <p>More thoughts on "How To Be Creative":

     <l>24. Dont worry about finding inspiration. It comes eventually.
     <p>Inspiration precedes the desire to create, not the other way
     around.

   <p>One of the reasons I got into drawing cartoons on the back of business
   cards was I could carry them around with me. Living downtown, you
   spend a lot of time walking around the place. I wanted an art form
   that was perfect for that.

   <p>So if I was walking down the street and I suddenly got hit with the
   itch to draw something, I could just nip over to the nearest park
   bench or coffee shop, pull out a blank card from my bag and get busy
   doing my thing. Seamless. Effortless. No fuss. I like it.

   <p>Before, when I was doing larger works, every time I got an idea while
   walking down the street Id have to quit what I was doing and schlep
   back to my studio while the inspiration was still buzzing around in my
   head. Nine times out of ten the inspired moment would have past by the
   time I got back, rendering the whole exercise futile. Sure, Id get
   drawing anyway, but it always seemed I was drawing a memory, not
   something happening at that very moment.

   <p>If youre arranging your life in such a way that you need to make a lot
   of fuss between feeling the itch and getting to work, youre putting
   the cart before the horse. Youre probably creating a lot of
   counterproductive Me, The Artist, I must create, I must leave
   something to posterity melodrama. Not interesting for you or for
   anyone else.

   <p>You have to find a way of working that makes it dead easy to take full
   advantage of your inspired moments. They never hit at a convenient
   time, nor do they last long.

   <p>Conversely, neither should you fret too much about writers block,
   artists block or whatever. If youre looking at a blank piece of paper
   and nothing comes to you, then go do something else. Writers block is
   just a symptom of feeling like you have nothing to say, combined with
   the rather weird idea that you SHOULD feel the need to say something.

   <p>Why? If you have something to say, then say it. If not, enjoy the
   silence while it lasts. The noise will return soon enough. I the
   meantime, youre better off going out into the big, wide world, having
   some adventures and refilling your well. Trying to create when you
   dont feel like it is like making conversation for the sake of making
   conversation. Its not really connecting, its just droning on like an
   old, drunken barfly.

   <p>People say "The Culture War" is Progressive vs Conservative, or
   Highbrow vs Lowbrow.

   <p>Wrong. It's Free vs Paid.
   
<h>baby boomers

   <p>Earlier I wrote:

     <p>For the record, I don't believe that some new happy happy joy joy
     marketing schpiel is going to somehow usher in a new dawn in human
     conciousness.
     <p>There is a new dawn in human conciousness happening whether we want
     it to or not. All marketing folk like myself are doing is just
     reacting to it, same as everyone else.

   <p>So why is this happening? No, I don't think we're all suddenly taking
   magic mushrooms, or Jesus has come back for a second round etc. There
   are many reasons, a lot of them simply to do with technology bringing
   people closer together etc.

   <p>But there may be another good reason; one I thought of last night
   while I was re-reading Tom Peter's wonderful new book, "Re-Imagine!":

   <p>The Baby Boomers, the most powerful demographic in the history of the
   world, are starting to age. The older ones are hitting their sixties.
   The younger ones are hitting their forties.

   <p>You get older, and suddenly life isn't so much about sex and ambition
   anymore. Suddenly you find there are fewer days ahead of you than
   there are behind you.

   <p>Suddenly you get reflective. Suddenly you start looking "inside".

   <p>And, because you're part of the most powerful demographic in the
   world, everybody and everything else starts doing the same.

   <p>I'll say it again. We live in wonderfully interesting times.

   <p>Been tweaking The Hughtrain:

     <p>THE HUGHTRAIN: "THE MARKET FOR SOMETHING TO BELIEVE IN IS
     INFINITE."

     <p>We are here to find meaning. We are here to help other people do
     the same. Everything else is secondary.

     <p>We humans want to believe in our own species. And we want people,
     companies and products in our lives that make it easier to do so.
     That is human nature.

     <p>Product benefit doesn't excite us. Belief in humanity and human
     potential excites us.

     <p>Think less about what your product does, and think more about human
     potential.

     <p>What statement about humanity does your product make?

     <p>The bigger the statement, the bigger the idea, the bigger your
     brand will become...

 
     <p>It's a work in progress. Expect more tweaking etc.

     <p>UPDATE: Yeah. I know. I ditched the word "Manifesto". About bloody
     time; it had been bugging me for a while. As a term, it worked fine
     in the 1990s. Then again, so did "Mission Statement".

     <p>Thanks to Primus for the suggestion.

     <p>UPDATE: Yeah. I know.

     <p>The word "Branding" will offend the spiritual people.

     <p>The word "Spiritual" will offend the marketing people.

     <p>Both parties, offended in equal measure. Hurrah!

     <p>For the record, I don't believe that some new happy happy joy joy
