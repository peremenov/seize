   <h>Watering Tricks by Lisa Erickson
   <p>Watering can be one of the biggest challenges to the gardener with
   limited strength or mobility. While it is easier physically to plant
   in pots, baskets and raised beds and boxes, these containers will dry
   out faster and require more frequent watering than will flower beds or
   gardens.
   <p>Knowing how often to water is not always easy to figure out. If your
   plants are drooping they're almost certainly thirsty. Sticking your
   finger up to the second joint into the soil will quickly tell you if
   the plant needs water. If you can't reach hanging baskets, assume they
   need watering every day as it is difficult to overwater a plant that
   has adequate drainage and is exposed to the wind and sun. (This is
   quite different from the all-too-common problem of overwatering indoor
   plants).
   <p>Many gardeners insist that the only time to water is in the morning
   because the hot sun of midday will burn the moist leaves. If you can't
   water in the morning, water when it is convenient. Try not to water at
   night as moisture and darkness set up a perfect environment for pests
   like slugs and mosquitoes as well as diseases like mildew and black
   spot. When you do water, do it thoroughly. If you just sprinkle a
   little on top each day, your plants will develop shallow root systems
   that create weak plants. Be sure to have holes in your pots for
   drainage so that water doesn't pool in the bottom causing root rot.
   If you live in an apartment, it is especially helpful to have an
   outside hose bib attached on the balcony. Some builders make this a
   standard feature but many don't even consider it necessary. If you are
   fortunate enough to have a hose outlet, buy the shortest hose that
   will allow to reach everywhere on your deck. The shorter the hose the
   lighter it is making it easier to to maneuver and hang up afterwards.
   Usually 25 feet with a 1/2" diameter is plenty of hose for a balcony
   or patio.
   <p>A hose attachment called a watering wand, a long, usually aluminum
   tube with a sprinkler-like nozzle, is a good investment. Wands are
   about 30" long, allowing you to reach further, even from a sitting
   position, into the back of a flower bed or up high into a hanging
   basket or window box. There are even wands available with a 90 degree
   curve so that you water straight into hanging baskets. There are
   shorter wands around 16" that are actually made for children but are
   quite light weight with soft foam grips and are extremely practical
   for those with little strength for lifting. Any watering wand
   attachment will allow you to water all of your plants without
   refilling a can, a great advantage when you have a lot of pots to
   maintain.
   If you don't have a water outlet on the balcony or deck you will need
   to haul water. Watering cans come in many styles and sizes. The metal
   ones are traditional but add water to them and they can be pretty
   heavy. Try a lighter weight plastic one in sizes from about 1 pint to
   1 1/2 gallons. If you keep a rain barrel on the deck you can fill from
   the top or use a hose from the bottom for filling. There are some
   quite sophisticated models on the market now with a spigot already in
   place.
   <p>Of course, the best way to ease watering tasks is to plant wisely.
   Using a mulch in beds, raised or flat, helps preserve water. Plant
   drought resistant plants , like portulaca (Portulaca grandiflorum),
   Sedum (Sedum spp.), Cleome (Cleome hasslerana), Dusty miller
   (Artemisia stellariana), Thyme (Thymus spp.), Shasta daisy
   (Chrysanthermum sperbum) that cope well with minimal watering.
   <p>If you mostly work with pots, however, an extra step taken in the
   initial soil preparation can save many hours all summer long. Adding
   moisture retention granules helps reduce watering in any kind of
   contained planting. These polymers granules soak up the water and then
   slowly release it back into the soil as it dries out. Some potting
   mixtures come with granules already mixed in but these tend to be
   pretty expensive. A better alternative is to buy the granules in small
   packages and mix them in as you plant. That way you can place them in
   the bottom half of the pot where the roots of the plant will get the
   most benefit. Hanging moss baskets which often require daily watering
   in the middle of summer, can go from 2-3 days between watering.
