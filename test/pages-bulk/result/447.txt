                             <h>Returning to Cambodia

   <p>Now I remember one of the things that drove me out of Cambodia. The
   constant exposure to suffering by thinking human beings existing in
   inhuman circumstances, combined with the constant awareness that one
   could mitigate that suffering, if only temporarily, and only for a
   small number. If you can normally disregard your own humanity, here it
   gnaws away at you. What is that ember? You look inside, and you see a
   heap of ashes where you thought your heart was.
   At the end of February 1998, after six months of traveling around the
   world, I returned to Cambodia to swelter in listless unemployment for
   two months--and then stumble into a job as press secretary for the
   Cambodian democratic opposition.

   <p>Here you'll find notes and writings on
     <l>* the death of Pol Pot
     <l>* the background of Sam Rainsy, Cambodian opposition leader
     <l>* sitting on the riverbank
     <l>* two weeks before the election

  <h>No Dancing

   <h>April 21, 1998

   <p>There was no dancing in the streets of Phnom Penh when the
   news of Pol Pot's death drifted down from the mountains, borne on
   radio waves and telephone wires. At first there was skepticism. He had
   been reported dead a couple of years earlier, only to reappear as the
   hidden leader of the Khmer Rouge and later as their captive. But this
   time it was true: One of the great monsters of history died last
   Wednesday, on the evening of the second day of the Khmer new year
   celebration.

   <p>Like some of you, I saw the news on CNN, which the staff at the gym
   are kind enough to switch to when I arrive. They watched with some
   interest, but as I left they changed the channel back to karaoke
   videos of Khmer love songs.

   <p>Later that day the skies darkened and poured out the first rain in
   months. Huge drops drenched the streets and rinsed a season's dust off
   the leaves of the plants on my balcony. The water ran off the roof and
   filled the rotting gutters, which leaked anyway, and splattered the
   muddy result onto my motorbike parked in front of the art shop
   downstairs. Across the street it carved rivulets and canyons into the
   mountains of sand which were mysteriously dumped on the sidewalk last
   month and seem to serve only as a playground for a small army of
   toddlers, who run up and down them in between bathroom breaks, which
   they take in the gutter.

   <p>I asked Mon, who cleans the apartment, if she was happy about Pol Pot.

   <p>"What about Pol Pot?" she asked in Khmer.

   <p>"Pol Pot is dead," I replied. "Last night his heart stopped."

   <p>She flashed a quick confused smile and went back to ironing. Mon is
   about 40, so she would have been a teenager when the Khmer Rouge
   completed their takeover of Cambodia. At best, she probably suffered
   four years of extreme deprivation and punishingly hard labor. When she
   passes by me during the course of her work, she pauses meekly and then
   crouches down low and creeps by. I have never asked her about her
   experience for fear she might panic, or fall apart in some unimagined
   way, a way I don't have the strength to see.

 <p>The Cambodian television stations didn't mention Pol
   Pot's death for two days. By Friday only one Khmer newspaper had
   reported it.

   <p>Meanwhile, the Bangkok Post filled its front page with a color photo
   of the corpse. Pointing at the huge photo, I asked the guys at the
   bank if they believed it.

   <p>"No," said one, "It's a trick. It's not him."

   <p>His friend disagreed, sort of.

   <p>"Well, it could be him. But they could have found someone else who
   looked like him." I pointed out that we all saw the videotape of Pol
   Pot at his "trial" only last year, and this was surely the same man,
   despite an inadequate black dye job on his silver hair.

   <p>"They could have replaced him before, and the real Pol Pot is still
   out there." The black dye seemed to raise suspicion, even if it was
   hard to see how it made the case for Pol Pot's death less convincing.

   <p>I went home and asked one of the art shop guys in my landlady's family
   if he was happy about Pol Pot.

   <p>"What about Pol Pot?" he asked in English. I told him, but he did not
   go out to dance in the street. He just said, "Oh, I didn't hear about
   that", and went back to putting on his black pants and white shirt. He
   works nights as a blackjack dealer at the floating casino. He's just
   about 25, so he probably remembers little or nothing of the Khmer
   Rouge regime.

   <p>Slowly, slowly, the news went around the city. It seems to be taking
   about the same amount of time to sink in as, in 1975, it had taken the
   Khmer Rouge to force the city's swollen population out to the rice
   fields.

   <p>On Saturday I went to the gym again. In six visits so far I have not
   seen another customer. I pedaled away on the bicycle and watched a
   thin black plume rise from Pol Pot's funeral pyre. A crowd of
   journalists were shown, pressing against a fence, trying hard to get a
   better look. For the most part they were photographers and cameramen
   from the Thai side of the border, which is an easy drive on smooth
   Thai roads from Bangkok.

   <p>Most of the Phnom Penh press corps was either stuck uselessly in Siem
   Reap, shadowing the King, or stuck at the bar of the Foreign
   Correspondents Club in the capital, pouring back coffee and beer, and
   trading war stories and comparing theories on about the degree to
   which the death of Pol Pot was a natural occurrence. (Click here to
   read mine.)

   <p>Though the Khmer Rouge presiding over the corpse's disposition did all
   they could to dispel any doubt it was Pol Pot's, they were less
   careful to preserve evidence that might have helped prove they didn't
   kill him. No blood samples were kept, for example. The Cambodian
   people have never gotten any answers before, and they probably won't
   get any this time either.

   <p>Now it's Monday, and the week of the New Year holiday is over. If you
   watch CNN or listen to BBC, you probably hear as much about Pol Pot as
   you would if you lived here.

  
  <h>The Cambodian Campaign Trail

   <h>May-July, 1998

   <p> Note: What you're reading here is mine alone. If you
   need to reach the Sam Rainsy Party, e-mail the Cabinet at
   samrainsy@bigpond.com.kh or see the SRP-USA website. I am no longer in
   Cambodia or working for or representing the SRP.

   <p>Saturday May 16, 1998: With a jolt the blades of the outboard motor
   bit once again into the roiling, rain-puckered surface of the Mekong.
   The motor whined and pushed our bathtub-sized boat forward again, into
   the blackness north of Kompong Cham.

   <p>I hunched forward, trying vainly to protect my backpack and its
   contents from the fat drops of rain that smacked me like birds' eggs.
   In the seat ahead of me was Eric, a reporter for the Phnom Penh Post
   and a former colleague at The Cambodia Daily, doing the same. Behind
   me the pilot of the speedboat stood, peering through the visor of a
   motorcycle helmet into the darkness ahead. From time to time he veered
   to avoid a fishing boat, net or piling that suddenly flashed into
   view, illuminated by the bolts of lightning striking one riverbank and
   then the other. Set among the few villages on the left bank were
   logging depots run by semi-independent military warlords allied with
   the province's governor, the brother of Hun Sen. Along the right bank
   was the road to Chhlong, reputed to be seething with bandits.

   <p>The bolts were so close they left a glow of heat on our faces.
   Sometimes another passenger shone a tiny flashlight ahead, in the vain
   hope it could prevent the boat from running aground again, but the
   feeble beam only illuminated millions of raindrops.

   <p>"Hey Rich--" screamed Eric over the rhythmically undulating whine of
   the straining engine, "--did you ever feel so mortal--"

   <p>My first day at my new job was only a few hours from over. Yesterday I
   was hired to do English-language communications for Sam Rainsy,
   Cambodia's main opposition politician. I'm the only foreigner there,
   and the only paid staffer. A short introduction is in order, because
   otherwise a lot of this won't make sense. A lot might not anyway, but
   I'll give it a shot.

   <p>Rainsy used to be Finance Minister in the early days of the coalition
   government that took over Cambodia after the UN-organized elections in
   1993. Rainsy's party, Funcinpec, won the election. But Hun Sen's
   party, the Cambodian People's Party, threatened to fight unless it was
   allowed into a coalition.

   <p>Together the two parties formed an efficient kleptocracy, siphoning
   off billions from the Cambodian economy while the UN and other
   international organizations poured billions into the other end. To
   keep it simple: Rainsy wouldn't play along. He demanded the public
   release of the government's logging contracts, and the CPP got
   Funcinpec to give him the shove. He was stripped of both his seat in
   the National Assembly and his post as Finance Minister, and took on a
   full-time role as the government's most vocal critic. He formed an
   opposition party, the Khmer Nation Party (now the Sam Rainsy Party),
   which attracted a core of young urban strivers, students, and factory
   workers, and won the hearts of many Cambodians all across the country.

   <p>The pitch of the motor dropped, and the boat started to drag. Slower
   and slower, until it stopped. One pilot stepped out. The water was
   ankle-deep. He unzipped and took a leak. The other pilot bent over
   with a lighter and clicked it over and over, trying to spark up a
   crumpled cigarette. In the flash of the lighter I could see he was
   bending over two plastic milk jugs. One them had a tube running out
   its open mouth to the motor. The pilot pulled it out and stuck it into
   the other jug. So in addition to crashing, drowning, lightning and
   bandits, I thought, we get to travel on a gasoline bomb.

   <p>Rainsy and his wife, Saumura, had pulled away from Kompong Cham five
   minutes before us in another little speedboat. They were desperate to
   get to Chhlong this evening; the bigger boat we had all been aboard
   was having engine trouble, and probably wouldn't get to Chhlong until
   well after midnight. My job was to get a couple of reporters up there.
   The downpour started just minutes after we raced off to the chase.

   <p>It seemed like a strange way to campaign, but this is Cambodia.

   <p>>Rainsy is a great story. Kicked out of govt for being
   >against corruption, nearly killed in grenade attack. A
   >French-educated intellectual with a wide populist streak. Mixes with
   >the people in the provinces, whips them up with a magnetic speaking
   >style. Single-minded determination. Colorful backdrop of the Cambodia
   >you know and love.
   >You, the determined reporter, can travel with him as he charges
   >through Cambodia's wilds. See the crowds gather about him, riveted as
   >he tells how he will take on the evils of deforestation, the scourge
   >of corruption, the wasting pangs of governmental neglect--no matter
   >the risk. Surrounded by dedicated volunteers who work hours almost as
   >long as the indefatiguable candidate, advised by his fellow candidate
   >and wife and comrade, the energetic, take-no-prisoners Saumura.
   >Both Rainsy and Saumura are the children of an earlier generation of
   >Cambodian patriots, who worked with the King to win independence from
   >France. Now they return from France, giving up a comfortable life for
   >a life of hardship and danger with their people.
   >And it is not for nothing. The people are rallying around them.
   >Hundreds join the Rainsy Party every day. Opinion polls show Rainsy
   >pulling ahead. He is the newest symbol of popular democracy in
   >Asia. The people are disgusted by the ruling party. Tired of
   >corruption. Sick of being terrorized. The question is how far will
   >the ruling party go to maintain its grip on power? Will the
   > international community get on its hind legs and take a stand for
   >democracy, or will it let the thugs of the ruling party steal this
   >election? Is it already too late? Rainsy says no, and he and his
   >supporters will risk their lives until the glorious--or bitter--end.
   >You can be there. You can be on the inside. You can watch it all
   >happen. And your ticket inside is your former housemate and business
   >partner, Rich--now Rainsy's communications officer (basically press
   >secretary plus).
   >Need I say more?

   <p>The grenade attack mentioned at the top was on
   March 30, 1997, almost fourteen months ago. If you were on my mailing
   list at the time, you might remember a message I wrote then, called
   Easter Sunday. At least sixteen people were killed right in front of
   the National Assembly as they protested against corruption in the
   judiciary. A bodyguard who jumped to cover Rainsy was killed, but
   Rainsy himself escaped serious injury.

   <p>The grenades appear to have been the opening of Hun Sen's campaign to
   stay on as prime minister. Although there's no rock-solid proof,
   there's plenty of evidence, both physical and circumstancial. And the
   complete failure of the government--which controls the police and
   judiciary--to investigate the attack is damning. I remember one
   comment Hun Sen made about it: Before the blood was even washed away
   he accused Rainsy of have the grenades thrown at himself in order to
   frame the CPP. A fairly risky strategy, I'd venture to say.

                                

   <p>Everybody coming on this boat trip met this morning in front of
   Rainsy's office in Phnom Penh. A few journalists, a few office
   volunteers, a couple of dozen party supporters, and me. Rainsy was
   running late--I would find out that was the standard---and we were
   grouped around several cars and vans, waiting to find out exactly
   where the boat would be and how to get there. A boom split the air and
   we flinched. Some of the party supporters ducked for a moment. It was
   just a car backfiring, or maybe a truck. Nervous laughs all around; we
   were all thinking the same thing.The boat was still bouncing across
   the waves when a flash lit up the sky ahead, and a starburst spread
   across the blackness. Then another--it was fireworks, a show seemingly
   just for us. Under them was an escarpment with a pagoda perched on
   top. We could only see the strings of lights running up the long
   stairway from the riverbank to the summit, but at the top was a
   life-size concrete elephant, quite realistic except for being bright
   blue.

   <p>We couldn't see this elephant from the little boat, even with all the
   fireworks going off, but I knew it was there because by pure chance,
   three weeks earlier, I and another friend, Chris Fontaine, were riding
   our rented motorcycles up that side of the river, about five hours
   into a marathon trip from Phnom Penh to Kratie. There we were, picking
   our way along the bumpy dirt track when we came across an old, well,
   geezer standing at a tight bend. He had a can in his hand a few soiled
   old banknotes. We recognized it immediately as the usual pagoda toll,
   paid in the the equivalent of about fifteen cents (bringing a smile to
   the old fellow's face) and turned off to see the pagoda.

   <p>Just as we reached the top of the hill and rode into the
   grounds, a group of brightly robed monks gave a tug to some ropes and
   pulled the tarp off of the said elephant. It was apparently the
   inauguration of this beast, which overlooked the Mekong majestically,
   and we were just in time. Sadly, it was getting dark and we didn't
   really know what to say, except to compliment the creature lavishly,
   admire the view, and press on.

   <p>So, back in the boat, looking up at this pagoda, or really at the
   place where the pagoda had to be, judging from the lights, I screamed
   to Eric, "There's a huge blue elephant up there." I'm not sure if he
   heard me, but in retrospect I realize it's just as well if he didn't.

   <p>My satisfaction at having recognized where we were in such an obscure
   location was only slightly more than counterbalanced by my disappoint
   at our unimpressive progress. We had not even reached Stung Trang, a
   small town an hour's drive north of Kompong Cham, and a locality
   chiefly notable for the fact that all the way back in October of 1995,
   when I had only been in Cambodia for three months, the bulk of the
   Cambodia Daily staff took the morning off to drive (well, I rode my
   motorcycle actually) up to Kompong Cham, chasing a solar eclipse.
   Kompong Cham was just short of the path of the eclipse, which more
   famously passed first over the Angkor temples in the northwest. But
   the temples were too far away from Phnom Penh for people who put out a
   daily paper to get to, so we took went northeast up the Mekong.

   <p>In Kompong Cham we rented a speedboat and, in conditions as beautiful
   as the later ones were ugly, sped north for an hour to the bend where
   the path of the river met that of the eclipse. We got off the boat
   onto the small floating dock and quickly attracted a crowd of
   villagers, just in time for the moon's shadow to silence the birds and
   quiet the winds. Sunset appears simultaneously around the entire
   horizon as the sun disk was eaten away. We Daily staffers and the
   villagers passed around dark film glasses from Thailand to watch as
   day turned into night. Where the sun shone through trees it projected
   a movie of the eclipse multiplied a million times on the ground.

   <p>Up in the town, we drank some celebratory Angkor beers as curious kids
   gawked at us with such intensity that they forgot themselves and
   grabbed their crotches. We asked a couple of townsfolk what they
   thought had just happened. There were two main theories. One was that
   King Sihanouk had recently returned from China, where he'd had a
   successful cataract removal. Hence the temporary disappearance of the
   sun, and then the return of the light, see? Theory Two was a little
   more sinister: it must be a scientific experiment that the Americans
   are doing. Hmm, we said to each other, maybe it's time to go. Really,
   there wasn't any hostility. I for one felt a tiny pang of guilt for
   our earlier plan to threaten to take the sun away for good unless the
   villagers paid up. Then we'd take our four bucks and...well, I did
   feel a pang of guilt.

   <p>Sorry for the digression, but I've been meaning to write that story
   down for a couple of years now, and it's finally done. If you like,
   we'll say that I was remembering the eclipse as our little boat
   bounced along, veering east toward Chhlong. My back was aching from
   being hunched over the backpack. The roar of the motor was starting to
   have a drug-like effect on my brain. The lightning threw the
   silhouetted trees along the bank into sharp relief, like a slide show
   getting increasingly abstract.

   <p>Behind the row of trees on the right was a small road that followed
   the east bank of the river. Chris and I had left the pagoda of the
   blue elephant and driven our motorcycles across a rickety pier onto a
   small ferry, and crossed over to this road. The sun was setting.
   Sometime in the process of riding out of the boat and up the steep,
   crumbling bank, my rear tire blew out. We found the one tire repair
   shop in the first village, but by the time it was fixed the muezzin
   was making the sunset call. We rode along that road to Chhlong crazy,
   bouncing in the dark and dust...but I'll have to add that story in
   later.

   <p>Suffice it to say for now that there aren't a lot of reasons to go to
   Chhlong, but so far it seems that I can't get there without traveling
   at night and in danger. The rain finally thinned out. After 3 hours in
   the little speedboat we pulled over to the right bank. This was the
   place, the family house of one of Rainsy's supporters. The only
   problem was that the only boat there was ours.

   <p>Hushed discussions among the Cambodians followed. "Oh my God, we've
   lost the candidate," said Eric. I imagined the other boat overturned,
   caught in branches at the edge of the river somewhere. Rainsy and
   Saumura and the people with them floating...no, it wasn't worth
   thinking about. Maybe they turned around and went back when the rain
   started, and we just didn't see them. There was nothing on the other
   end of the radio.

   <p>We climbed the bank to see a graceful wooden house overlooking a
   spacious yard with a score of tables set out with dishes, bowls
   glasses. It was supposed to be a welcoming banquet, but we were three
   hours late and Rainsy was missing. We went to sleep worried on the
   wooden floor. While we slept, the big boat arrived, with Rainsy,
   Saumura and the rest on board. They had turned back a few minutes
   after the rain started, and chugged upriver all night.

   <p>Sometimes there's a break from politics. For a couple of weeks it was
   "Central Park West", Woody Allen's one-act play about five lost souls
   cheating on each other and picking each other apart. My housemate
   Sarah, four others and I are rehearsing it for a two-show stand
   upstairs at the Globe restaurant. It's going to be a play-reading,
   partially staged, but we get to look at the scripts. We rehearse in
   the afternoon in the restaurant, shouting out bitter, sarcastic,
   wounded New York lines while distant fishermen are framed in the tall,
   open window, poling their longboats along the opposite shore of the
   Tonle Sap.

   <p>A month earlier, when I was still unemployed and aimless, I took a
   6:30 am ride across the Japan-Cambodia Friendship Bridge to Chroy
   Changvar, the pensinsula that separates the merging Mekong and Tonle
   Sap and faces Phnom Penh. After wobbling along until the riverine
   village lanes gave out. But I kept to the riverside, eventually
   balancing my rickety old Honda on the raised footpaths between
   silt-fed vegetable patches. I stopped when I felt as if setting my
   bike on its stand wasn't likely to get in anyone's way this day, or
   maybe this week, and took a seat on the riverbank of sunbaked mud.

   <p>So I am back there. I'll tell you what I'm looking at. It's the
   riverfront of Phnom Penh, the thriving metropolis that is the capital
   of Cambodia, a small country in which I find myself unexpectedly, even
   after three years. On the left, the southernmost extent of my view, is
   the Naga, a five-story floating house of sin--a Malaysian investment
   vehicle known as the floating casino, where, until just two hours ago,
   Joe Cochrane and I set a Ben Franklin each against the voracious house
   and its unfavorable blackjack odds and staggered out, three hours and
   numerous free beers later with noticeable financial gains.( Oh Naga, I
   have waited two long years to take my sweet revenge on you.)

   <p>The engineless gambling ship gleams, moored on the riverside next to
   some mud flats where squatters used to live (before they were rousted
   in the name of private property and civic beautification). Just north,
   or moving to my right, above a barren concrete embankment, stands the
   Cambodiana Hotel, which stood incomplete and abused throughout the
   Vietnamese regime of the 1980s and was reborn in time to collect the
   plenitude of United Nations largesse in the early 90s.

   <p>The morning's fishing boats, long, narrow, hand-planed barques pushed
   by long-tail motors or waggling wooden oars, work the current in front
   of my riverbank, south on the Tonle Sap to Chaktomuk, where the Sap
   draws the excess waters from the swollen Mekong during the wet season,
   and pours them back during the dry. On the flat top of the alluvium
   behind me a family sets to work on what looks like a field of potatos
   springing from the loam. If the sight of me, sitting on their
   riverbank and tapping on a laptop computer surprises them they don't
   betray it. There is no doubt I am the only one out here this morning
   with a computer, a camera and a cellphone--and no hoe. It's 7:30 and
   the sun is starting to hint at the heat of the day.

   <p>Across the river from me, and from the colony of ants which
   has set its collective intelligence to the doubtlessly crucial
   evolutionary role of climbing up my shorts, are the golden gables of
   the Royal Palace, where Norodom Sihanouk was raised, then later
   imprisoned by the Khmer Rouge. The grand entrance, a pavilion that
   normally features a huge portrait of the King, the Queen, or one of
   the their presumably noble antecedents stands facing me square on. My
   patch of silt is ennobled by this favorable exposure, and I can feel
   it! There is no portrait hanging there at the moment, although the
   King has recently returned to Cambodia. He stays in Siem Reap near the
   Angkorean temples, not in Phnom Penh. It can only be a way to distance
   himself from the political leadership of Hun Sen and the Cambodian
   Peoples Party, who stamped out any reasonable notion of sharing power
   last July.

   <p>The riverbank on this side is for farming. On the other side, the city
   side, it seems to be for dumping untreated sewage and burning garbage.
   Thanks to plenty of river silt and to the effluent of the capital's
   citizenry, that side is rich with seasonal farmland. Above the small
   but fertile plots, each one staked out by a seasonal farmer, stands a
   row of riverfront businesses. First to the right of the palace is the
   Globe, where the playreading will be. It's operated by Duncan,the
   saxophonist for the Psychedelic Furs and the author of the song
   "Pretty in Pink". That will mean nothing to anyone who did not cut
   their musical teeth in the early 80s. Explanations for this odd
   circumstance are anyone's guess.

   <p>After a vacant garage is a restaurant that was until two months ago Le
   Rotonde, notable for its equally illegal and obvious casino, and as
   the site of an impressive involuntary exhalation of comestibles by Mr.
   Kevin Brown, who is even now wincing as he reads this. The European
   owners of La Rotonde were rounded up only two months ago by Interpol,
   in connection with a series of bank robberies in Belgium and
   presumably provided seed money for the restaurant.

   <p>A few doors north of that, overlooking a flatbed wooden river schooner
   chugging its way around the peninsula on which I sit (and whose ant
   colonies are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their
   explorations) is the now legendary FCCC--the Foreign Correspondents
   Club.

   <p>But rather than sully your screens with tiresome tales of expats, I'll
   describe the carved longboat which has just coasted alongside my piece
   of riverbank. In the rear stands a sturdy-looking woman guiding the
   vessel with a wooden oar fastened aft and starboard. At the bow stands
   her man in a bright yellow jersey. With a sidearm swing and a grunt he
   looses the net. It spreads like the cowl of an airborne jellyfish
   across the water before the weights along its edges pull it down, then
   to be gathered together, freeing the waters of the Sap but imprisoning
   some of its denizens. The boat drifts north, out of view. Now the ants
   are crawling all over me. It's getting hot too--the early morning
   couldn't last long in a place where the the daily high approaches 40C
   in this hot season. I'm eying the silty waters. The effluent is, after
   all, on the other side, the city side, right?

   <p>The water is getting just a little whipped up by a southerly wind.
   Heavy-laden riverboats plow their noses deep into the current, upper
   and lower decks groaning beneath sacks of something--rice?--and
   plastic jugs of something else. Gas, or just empty ballast. They kick
   up a light wake ten feet beneath where I sit on the bank.

   <p>From here Phnom Penh doesn't look a lot bigger than its sister cities
   along the river, Kompong Cham, Kratie, and so on. Not like a capital,
   not like a city of a million looking for a mouthful of steamed rice
   and a fair shot at democracy. If this were Ho Chi Minh City, a couple
   hundred kilometers down the delta, I could look straight up and see
   giant neon billboards for Seiko and Coca-Cola, flashing their urgent
   messages to the residents of the people's paradise. Here there is
   nothing but the sun and the first tentative clouds of the coming rains
   and a field full of potato plants, or whatever they are, sighing as
   the sun-baked soil is loosened around their straining stems.

   <p>Five minutes later the mud has pulled my shoes off and I'm wading into
   the glistening brown waters. I dive and plow my hands into the velvety
   bottom, pulling up hands full of rich river silt. I clench my fists
   around the sinuous smoothness and squeeze, open my painted hands in
   the sun and watch it burst into stormy puckered rivulets that run down
   my arms, meet the border of air and water and blow away.

   <p>Anyway I came home from a playreading rehearsal one day, still
   feverish from some organism that filled last night with
   hallucinations, and desperate for a nap. I found our palace full of
   Cambodians, and Beth, moving things around bailing like crazy. Both my
   bedroom and Sarah's were transformed into wading pools. Water poured
   through the ceiling fans and dripped steadily from dozens of bubbles
   on the ceilings. All my things--barely unpacked as I had moved in only
   recently--were dumped out into the living room. We knew they'd be
   working on the water pipes under the house--so why was all the water
   upstairs? This has to be a legendary screw-up! How the hell did they
   flood the upstairs by fixing the pipes downstairs? Our landlord, a CPP
   colonel, stood barefoot surveying the mess. We finally communicated
   successfully. A big piece of the roof collapsed under the first really
   violent rainstorm of the year, and no, nobody is going to go up there
   with a tarp or anything, not until tomorrow. I'm exhausted already and
   now I have to bail my room with a dustpan. After half an hour I give
   up and collapse on the bare slats of my bed frame out in the living
   room.

   <p>Five hours on, the rain stopped, started and stopped again, and the
   buckets kept filling. Now and then there's a wet tearing and a splat
   as a piece of ceiling peels away, dumps a load of water, and falls to
   the floor.

   <p>A few nights ago I was riding my motorbike home at midnight and I
   stopped at the Japanese ambassador's house to watch some of Denmark v.
   Saudi Arabia. I didn't see the ambassador though--that's because I was
   watching it with the guards out on the sidewalk. They ran a cord out
   of the house and set up a little color TV facing the street. There was
   a little table with a couple of half-eaten bowls of noodles. It's good
   to develop a relationship with the guys who carry AK-47s on your
   block. They offered me a chair, which I accepted, and we sprawled out
   as best we could on the edge of the street, a few people, a few
   motorbikes lit up by French sunshine coming through the television.
   Behind us stood the buildings of the Ministry of Interior, nerve
   center of a vast and unruly patchwork of security forces. Above us
   hung the Cambodian stars.

                                              
   <p>July 10, 1998: The polling date is only two weeks away. People in this
   politics-crazed town are starting to really wonder what happens if the
   CPP sees no way out. They have to be realizing that they will not win
   a majority, even after all the abuses they have committed, all the
   ways they have hijacked the elections. So they look to the polling
   date, and count on massive fraud, or at least enough fraud to get them
   a majority. But that door is closing--the election commission is under
   the eyes of the international community and a squad of seasoned
   election advisers. So far they've let the ruling party get away with
   everything including murder, but they want a clean election day.
   Ballots printed on special paper in New Zealand, silver nitrate ink
   for dipping fingers, triple-locked ballot boxes from Japan. We want
   the polls to be fair too, but that would slam another door in the face
   of the CPP.

   <p>Behind the twenty-foot fences of the sprawling CPP compound, tension
   must be high. The hardest of the hard-liners must be pushing for
   drastic action to prevent an embarrassing result. Where is the next
   door? In a more stable country, under the rule of law, we would feel
   nothing but positive about our increasing popularity. Here it means we
   are dealing with a cornered animal.

   <p>I dropped by the SRP Cabinet office tonight to make sure Rainsy had
   called up Jeff at the Daily about the Sin Sen story. Sin Sen, long a
   major figure in the CPP, threw his support to Rainsy yesterday. A
   shift in the wind that that strengthens us while it makes the other
   side less happy, and more dangerous. Sin Sen is making himself an
   example for others who might want to shift allegiance. We just hope
   the other side doesn't make an example of him. I should add that Sin
   Sen happens to live next door to our office.

   <p>As I came out, passing through a crowd of our unarmed security team, a
   headlight beamed down the street and a low-slung motorcycle roared
   toward us. The kind of motorcycle favored by the kind of tough guys
   who work for the military bodyguards, the Ministry of the Interior or
   some other enforcer group. I tensed as it came, and looked away, at
   the faces of our guards frozen in the glare. I forced myself to relax
   just as it passed. Then I got on my own motorcycle and buzzed off into
   the darkness.

 

   <p>The day after the voting was July 27. The early results were
   excellent. But the tide turned as the counting went into the
   afternoon. Spirits in the Rainsy office drifted into depression.
   Something was wrong. The numbers weren't adding up. It was difficult
   to get the figures. Late in the day, after a long break in the
   counting, the CPPwas pulling ahead. But how? Then two days of
   depression. In the US you would know that now you can relax. For the
   first time, Rainsy seemed at a loss, without a new direction yet.
   Nothing we didn't expect, right? Stories filtered in--beatings of
   observers, cheating in the counting process. The Joint International
   Observer Group statement rocketed out on late on the 27th. Broadly
   representative of the will of the people, as if they could know. It's
   ostensibly a preliminary statement, but of course it's the only one
   that will ever count.


   <p>Three months after polling day. I usually get up after staring around
   my room for about ten minutes, considering the pros and cons.
   Eventually it becomes more likely than not that there is coffee ready.
   I prop the door open with a disused electrical adapter and pad across
   the red and white tiles to the cybercafe. Mao has put out coffee and
   two cups, one with sugar for me and one without for Sarah. Sarah will
   soon race out of her room, pour a cup of coffee and drink half of it,
   and race off to work at the hotel one hour late. I will pour her
   leftover coffee into mine and check the Daily over. Obviously I have
   already hit control-m to download my e-mail. I surf the Daily for
   local articles that concern Rainsy, the opposition in general, the
   formation of a government, or issues that Rainsy can comment on.
   Anything big I will have to write a statement about, or a letter to
   the editor, or pick a journalist to market a story idea to. Same with
   the e-mail; I'm on CamNews so I get most of the wire service stories
   on Cambodia.

   <p>October 1998:Things are going rather poorly as far as democracy is
   concerned. Hun Sen made the world afraid to get rid of him, so they
   let him stay by sponsoring and predictably approving his rigged
   election. It's a secret sellout. So I'm trying to keep working hard
   despite the demoralization that comes with consistent defeats. Now
   Rainsy is off visiting DC, NY and Paris trying to get our side of the
   story out, while the opposition members here head to Thailand so they
   can't be threatened into selling out.

   <p>Strange kind of fame this; my words go all over the place but usually
   without a name, or with Rainsy's name attached! Probably good for me,
   ego-wise. Rainsy went off to DC and NY this morning. I'm in Bangkok
   with half of the SRP members of parliament. We sit around in a big
   house here listening to sixties songs and typing in list of party
   activists to give to human rights groups. Maybe later today I'll try
   to go back to Cambodia--I hope they let me in because all my stuff is
   there!

   <p>You might have seen Hun Sen's threats to close the Daily and the Phnom
   Penh Post; there was a small article in the Chicago Tribune on Oct 5
   or 6. It's all part of a gradual crackdown on rights in general, as
   Hun Sen has learned that the UN and the foreign governments will let
   him get away with anything as long as there is a democratic
   window-dressing.

   <p>I'm just hoping that the situation will somehow stabilize, and I can
   reduce my role over the next couple of months. I don't know how it
   turn out, but the signs are bad. I think Hun Sen is aiming to
   replicate the level of democracy in, say, Suharto's Indonesia.

   <p>I'm depressed, demoralized, dejected. There are days when the rain
   comes down so hard, and I wonder what it is to live in a world so full
   of ignorance and the laziness that lets evil thrive. Is it better to
   flee into a world of philosophy and study the "nature of evil" or
   other abstracts, or to give up and avoid seeing the worse part of its
   effects, to flee and find a mental place where people enjoy the
   blessings of ignorance, if there is such a place?

   <p>If I could describe the last few months I would say that they have
   been full of stories, many of them funny and most of them sad. I have
   seen from closer than ever before the longing for democracy crushed by
   the greed of the powerful and the indifference of the countries that
   themselves already enjoy a kind of democracy. I have seen those who
   fight for freedom wound themselves and their struggle with terrible
   errors born of their own flaws. I am so full of stories that they
   battle each other to get out and fall over themselves untold. I have
   had so many thoughts they tangle in thickets.

   <p>It's not possible, at least for me, to go on fighting for what I think
   is the truth unless there's a chance of success. That's true for most
   people, and I try to remember it when organizing. There has to a
   chance, some light at the end of the tunnel or at least a trick of the
   imagination. For a while it did seem as if the Cambodian elections
   could change something, something that was supposed to have changed
   back in 1993 when UN organized elections, but didn't.

   <p>The 1998 elections were supposed to prove that the world did give
   Cambodians the gift of democracy. Everything was set up to show this,
   the world came with money and advisers to make sure the show went on,
   and it did. The show went on.

   <p>And now it seems the moment has come when we realize it was a trick,
   though not entirely one of the imagination. There are villains in this
   story, absolutely, but they are not the ones I expected.

   <p>For the past three months I have churned out hundreds of statements,
   spoken to legions of correspondents on and off the record, studied
   election law, interviewed the victims of abuse at the hands of the
   police and the army, advised and cajoled politicians perhaps far
   beyond what is my right coming from outside Cambodia. But my job was
   to communicate our ideas and our picture of the Cambodian situation,
   and how could I do it if I didn't understand as best I could what it
   was, and how could I not try to make our behavior the most effective
   possible in order to help bring Cambodia a little closer to democracy?

   <p>I know very well that it is going to sound as if I am taking too much
   responsibility on myself. Maybe I'm just building myself up, wanting
   to be influential, tending to see myself as more central than I ever
   was. If so, I have no apologies for it. Anyone asks me for advice, I
   try to give what's in my competence, and those who don't want to hear
   about it can hit delete.

   <p>I have a microscopic knowledge of the 1998 Cambodian elections now.
   But I'm going to make a great effort to step back and summarize it for
   you, and if I'm at all successful in that then you will understand why
   today I feel so beaten. And then if I have anything left I will try
   very hard to find the lessons in it, and to search for the gains,
   because there must have been some, right?
