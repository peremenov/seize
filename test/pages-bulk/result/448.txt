   resources to support business site selection decisions in the USA and
   worldwide.  This website has attracted over 1 million visits in the 3
   years since it was launched.   Just ask us for free help reflecting
   over 15 years of experience in this niche and thousands of contacts.

   <p>Our independent research and referral work is free for executives who
   are facing business expansion decisions because we are supported by
   leading professionals who can deliver valuable services to more
   executives than they might reach through their own professional
   networking activities, events, and exclusive marketing efforts.

   <p>We can also perform custom market research projects.  We welcome
   suggestions, support for our work, and relevant reciprocal links.

   <p>Our goal is to make it easier for executives and their advisors to
   plan and implement their business expansion projects to achieve their
   strategic and ROI goals faster and better.

   <p>We deliver well-qualified introductions to the professionals and
   information resources they need at the time, reflecting the research
   and "lessons learned" from many other projects..
   <p>We personally introduce executives for free to valuable local market
   knowledge and professional contacts as an independent global referral
   service (like a concierge in this niche) through market research and
   the development of working relationships with :
     <l>*  Top executives facing strategic choices and capital investment
       decisions about where they will do business : where to establish,
       acquire, expand, move or restructure their operations or alliances
       as markets and plans change.
     <l>*  Economic development professionals representing communities and
       regions whose leaders are highly motivated to attract and retain
       growing companies and develop globally competitive business
       clusters.

       investment project plans in North America, Europe, Asia or
       worldwide.  These may be local specialists or global experts in
       foreign direct investment (FDI) projects worldwide.

   Investment magazine, published by the Financial Times group.

   <p>Our 7 year analysis of investment project trends by state and our
   analysis of economic development lead generation costs per job created
   may also be of interest.

   <p>Our April 2006 newsletter (4 pages with graphs) summarizes this market
   research and analysis, including a 12 year chart of major project
   announcements.

   <p>Our work is analogous to a concierge service, personally assisting
   executives to invest in the growth of their companies anywhere by
   introducing valuable contacts in confidence.

   <p>We organize and share valuable market knowledge and networks of
   contacts in a globally consistent way through targeted market research
   and relationship development work.

   <p>This helps company executives, community leaders, and service
   providers to meet.

  
   <p>Our independent marketing, research, relationship development, and
   well-qualified referral work can share knowledge of service
   capabilities and benefits to advance the marketing interests of :
    <l> * Economic development professionals
    <l> * Professional services providers 

   <p>We can introduce relevant executives and their advisors to the
   benefits you offer.  See how to request a relevant directory listing
   (free), and our suggestions for reciprocal links.

   <p>State economic development professionals who are responsible for
   attracting business investment and providing site selection assistance
   to executives and their consultants were invited in April 2006 to
   provide an informative article on this simple topic : "Why should a
   business invest in your state?"

   <p>The article content and size was entirely discretionary to share their
   point of view as a free service to our 500,000+ visitors in 2006.

   <p>We publish their "Point of View" articles here for convenient
   reference by executives.  Other replies will be published once they
   are received from the remaining state officials.
   "Point of View" articles were contributed by many state economic
   development officials :

   

   <p>Many states did not yet reply to this free offer, despite reminders
   and assurances that they intended to do so.
   
   <p>Our Event Recall feature makes it easy to discover which areas are
   promoting themselves to target industries through events such as trade
   shows.  Our biotech directory is one example.

   <p>There is also an Ad Recall feature to highlight areas which are known
   to advertise, such as to easily find their ads, websites, and contacts
   through search tools.  A new Ad Recall feature highlights advertisers
   in fDi magazine.
   <p>Newsletter - October 2005   Tips on using Google for business
   location selection searches, with information about 2005 progress and
   our 2006 marketing plans. Newsletter - November 2005  (pdf) Launching
   our new website  www.OnTheShortList.com and our new custom Google site
   search features - Area Search, USA Search, CRE Search, etc.

   <p>A new book in 2006 by a veteran site selection consultant may also be
   of interest.

   
   <p>We expect 550,000+ visitors in 2006 to take advantage of the extensive
   information we share about economic development agencies and
   professional services.  That is up 175%+ from 200,000 visits in 2004 -
   the year when we launched this website.  See our daily visit or
   monthly visit graphs and regional analysis.  After only 3 years, our
   visit levels already exceed most of the specialty magazines in this
   market even though they have been in circulation for 20 - 50 years.
   This is a personal service for executives and advisors - not just
   website content and links.   Tell us what you need to find for your
   project, and we will help you in confidence.

   <p>Although we make it easy to find thousands of useful resources
   worldwide through this website, we primarily share market knowledge
   personally in response to specific requests from executives about
   their interests, such as well-qualified referrals.

   <p>Please contact us to discuss how our work could support your
   interests.

   <p>We apply our research capabilities and extensive networks of contacts
   and working relationships beyond the extensive published content of
   this website.  We are also experimenting with Google Groups as another
   way to openly share market knowledge.

   <p>Congratulations to 2006 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Muhammad Yunus and
   the Grameen Bank he founded to promote local economic development and
   alleviate poverty through microcredit programs.

   <p>These enabled small groups of poor people in Bangladesh to access
   unsecured loans in very small amounts for their own self-help business
   efforts which would not be possible through the traditional bank loan
   processes.  This made it possible for many poor people to find their
   own path out of poverty through their work and savings, rather than
   rely on high-cost sources of capital or continuous government aid,
   social programs, or charity.  This development model has been repeated
   elsewhere as an effective approach to poverty reduction challenges,
   and adopted by various non-profit charitable organizations as a way to
   leverage the economic impact of their limited resources.

   <p>The Nobel Lecture by the winner, typically in December, should be a
   very interesting presentation, as was the 2004 Lecture when  Prof.
   Wangari Muta Maathai of Kenya won it for her Green Belt Movement's
   contributions to sustainable development, democracy and peace..
   

   <p>One of the interesting concepts promoted by Muhammad Yunus and others
   is the idea of "non-loss" companies with a clear social purpose as
   their main objective.  In short, they are managed like for-profit
   business ventures, but are not managed for profit maximization, but
   rather to maximize the desired social impact of their work.

   <p>This differs from the typical nature of "non profit" organizations,
   which may similarly focus on trying to achieve good social outcomes,
   but perhaps more from the perspective of raising and distributing
   money or other benefits as charity rather than by managing the process
   for demonstrable results as in a business venture.

   <p>In other words, a non-profit may measure activity (how much it has
   given away and to how many) rather than results (what has been changed
   to achieve sustainable social or economic progress beyond immediate
   crisis-response).  This concept of business-like social ventures has
   started to catch on with philanthropic business leaders who want to
   achieve lasting results, as reflected in some of the resources listed
   in our Humanitarian / Philanthropy directory.
