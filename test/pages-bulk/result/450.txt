                              <h>SOUTH AUSTRALIA



     <p>ALRM is trying to give its clients even better service than it does
     already, by using the resources of the Internet.
     ALRM offices are hundreds of miles apart.
     Our lawyers and field officers work in remote areas, far from the
     nearest law libraries.
     We are using the Internet to take the law libraries to our lawyers
     and field officers, and to take information to our clients.
     This pilot project has not required any additional funding.

   <h>THE ROLE OFTHE ABORIGINAL LEGAL RIGHTS MOVEMENT

     <p>The Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement Inc (ALRM) exists to get
     social justice for Aboriginal people and their communities. The
     Movement began in 1971 and was incorporated in 1973.

     <p>ALRM is a non-profit organisation. We provide a legal service to
     Aboriginal people and their communities.

     <p>ALRM works to keep law and justice systems honest. We demand
     recognition of our cultures. We fight for economic and social
     status for our dispossessed people.

     <p>Our role has expanded to include changing laws where needed, to
     improve social justice and further the fight for equal rights.

     <h>Conflict Policy

     <p>For many years now, ALRM has had a policy of not allowing its
     lawyers to act in cases of conflict between Aboriginal people.
     Both parties can still approach us for help, but we'll have to
     assess your cases to see if we need to arrange alternative
     representation.

     <h>Field Officers

     <p>On the phone or in person, you should ask to speak to a Field
     Officer. They will listen to your questions, get some details about
     your situation, and find ways for you to get the answers,
     information and help you need.

     <p>ALRM has a 24-hour answering service. You can get hold of a Field
     Officer during day-time office hours and, in the case of
     emergencies, at night. If you're ever picked up by the police, call
     us for help right away - before answering any questions.

     <h>Criminal Section

     <p>ALRM lawyers cover most Courts in South Australia.

     <p>The lawyers give legal advice, represent you through all Court
     proceedings, help to prepare documents and assist with appeals.

     <p>Call us as soon as possible if you want a lawyer with you in Court.

     <p>The lawyers need you to tell them what you want, so they can handle
     your case the best way. 

    <h> Civil Section

     <p>This Section of ALRM works to get justice for you in non-criminal
     matters. We help you to get and use your own power through action
     and education.

     <p>This Section handles equal opportunity, family issues and
     separations, workers' and other compensation, police complaints,
     and community and corporate issues.

    <h> Equal opportunity

     <p>If you think you've been discriminated against, we can help. We'll
     be there to support you if you want to make a complaint to the
     Equal Opportunity Commission. You can make the complaint yourself.
     Our Field Officers and lawyers will assist you at any stage.

     <h>Family law

     <p>Many of you speak to us about custody, access and maintenance of
     your children. We prepare Court documents, appear in Court with you
     and help you to reach a good solution. ALRM knows that going to
     Court about the family is stressful. We'll work to help you find a
     better way to deal with the problem.

     <h>Workers compensation

     <p>Sometimes, when people are hurt at work, their claims are not
     accepted. If you need to, you can dispute your employer's or the
     insurer's decisions. ALRM can help you to get those decisions
     reviewed to get a fair result.

     <h>Police complaints

     <p>If you've been treated badly by the police, come to us.
     Your Field Officer will help you to lodge a Police Complaint
     statement.

     <p>The complaint goes to the Police Complaints Authority (PCA). The
     PCA is independent of the police and can investigate your
     complaint. ALRM will help you to make the statement, explain to you
     about the rest of the process and tell you what's happening as it
     goes along.

     <h>Family separations

     <p>ALRM works with the Aboriginal Child Care Agency to write and give
     information to the National Enquiry by the Human Rights and Equal
     Opportunity Commission into the Separation of Indigenous Families.
     If you've got any questions, call us.

     <h>Compensation

     <p>If you have suffered injury because of the actions of another
     person or organisation, you may be able to claim compensation. We
     can talk to you about this and help you go further.

     <h>Community and corporate issues

     <p>The ALRM Civil Section includes a Corporate Solicitor who can
     provide information, legal assistance and representation for
     community organisations and family groups.
     If your group needs to be incorporated under Federal or State laws
     for funding purposes, we can help. In consultation with your group
     members, we can give you legal assistance to draft your
     constitution. We also can provide advice on meeting procedures,
     elections or other issues arising within Aboriginal community
     organisations.

     <h>Copyright, Property, or Business matters

     <p>If you need information, ALRM's Civil Section will help you find
     the information you need.

     <h>The Aboriginal Justice Advocacy Committee (AJAC).

     <p>ALRM and the South Australian State Department of Aboriginal
     Affairs (DOSAA) formed AJAC in June 1994. The Committee is funded
     by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders Commission (ATSIC)
     through DOSAA.

     <p>AJAC monitors how the State Government meets the recommendations of
     the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. We make
     sure that Aboriginal people are involved in getting those
     recommendations to work.
     We keep you informed about what's happening.

     <p>The Committee meets every month.

    <p> We want the opinions and concerns of Aboriginal people about the
     Royal Commission, and how its recommendations are being put into
     practice. Contact your local AJAC representatives about what you
     think your Committee should be looking at and working on.

     <h>Aboriginal Visitors Scheme 

     <p>The Scheme works across South Australia, and means that you don't
     have to be alone in the police cells if you are detained. ALRM pays
     for the time and travel of volunteer Aboriginal visitors who come
     to you to provide support.

     <p>The police must contact the AVS every time they keep an Aboriginal
     person in a police cell.

     <p>ALRM has visitors in Adelaide, Berri, Ceduna, Coober Pedy, Mount
     Gambier, Murray Bridge, Port Augusta, Port Lincoln, Port Pirie and
     Whyalla.

     <p>Visitors make sure you're not alone and that you're being treated
     properly.
     They look after your rights, get you medical help if you need it,
     and contact your family if you want.

     <p>If you haven't been treated properly, the visitor can make a report
     on that, so that you can lodge a Police Complaint.

     <h>Anti-Poverty Unit

     <p>This Unit used to be your Financial Counselling Service.
     Now, we're doing more community education and fewer individual
     cases.

     <p>ALRM is working to give Aboriginal people training on money
     matters.
     We'll be setting up self-help groups in communities, and they will
     start up networks to give advice to others. You'll be able to make
     good financial decisions with good information.

     <h>The Native Title Unit (NTU)

     <p>The NTU is based in Adelaide.
     We make claims for Native Title or compensation.
     We help sort out disagreements between people making claims.
     We represent you in any matter connected with the Native Title Act.

     <p>The NTU is responsible for all land claims outside the Anangu
     Pitjatjantjara and Maralinga Tjarutja lands. If you think you're
     entitled to claim under the Native Title Act, write to us with the
     names of who's claiming, the area being claimed and who'll benefit
     from it.
