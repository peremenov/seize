                             <h>Time Traveler's Chess

   <p>Time traveler's chess is played exactly like standard chess except
   that chessmen can travel backwards in time. As an introductory remark
   we might say that in science fiction there are various notions about
   what time travel is or could be. One species of time travel, for
   instance, involves the idea that there are many universes, a manifold
   of universes, in fact, capable of containing branching time lines and
   alternative histories. The conception of time travel in time
   traveler's chess is different from the "many universe" conception and
   different from a large number of other interesting conceptions.

<h>The Concept

   <p>In time traveler's chess, there is only one world, and time travel is
   always continuous. If a chessman begins to move backwards in time at
   move 30 and travels all the way back to move 20, then the time
   traveling chessman will be on the board, moving backwards in time, at
   move 29, at move 28, at move 27, and so forth. There will be at least
   two versions of the chessman on the board from move 20 to move 29,
   since in the "personal history" of this chessman, the chessman first
   moved forward in time to get to move 30 and then began to move
   backwards in time. So there will be a forward moving version and a
   backwards moving version. To make matters even more confusing, at move
   20 in our example, when the time traveling chessman begins to move
   forward again in time, a second forward moving version of the chessman
   appears on the board. Then, so long as this second forward moving
   version survives there will actually be three versions of the chessman
   on the board through move 29!

   <p>A time traveler's chess set, then, has three varieties of chessmen. In
   the starting position - the same starting position as for standard
   chess - all chessmen are "untraveled" in time. For each of these
   chessmen there should be on hand, in case need arises, a corresponding
   "traveling" chessman. When a traveling chessman appears on the board,
   that chessman should be understood to be currently traveling backwards
   in time. (If we could be such a chessman, stationed in a safe spot on
   the chessboard, we would see astounding sights. We would see pawns
   move backwards. We would see chessmen occasionally spring into
   existence on squares being vacated by other chessmen. Gazing beyond
   the perimeters of the board, we could observe chess clocks running
   backwards, pens leaping into players' hands, doughnuts miraculously
   forming whole, unbite by unbite, from the mouths of humans.) For each
   traveling chessman there must be be a "traveled" chessman. Traveled
   chessmen are grizzled veterans; they have moved backwards in time and
   are again moving forward in time.

   <p>The three versions - untraveled, traveling, traveled - are three
   stages in a personal history. Each such personal history is folded
   back through time in such a way that all three stages play out
   simultaneously on the board.

   <p>A time traveler's chess set can easily be fabricated from three
   standard sets and some modeler's paint. Untraveled chessmen might look
   pristine, traveling chessmen strange, traveled chessmen experienced.

<h>The Rules

   <p>Again, in time traveler's chess there are three versions of each
   chessman: the untraveled version, the traveling version, and the
   traveled version. In the initial setup - identical to the initial
   setup for standard chess - all chessmen are untraveled. Untraveled
   chessmen move exactly like chessmen in standard chess, except in the
   case of "annihilation", explained below.

   <p>Traveling chessmen are the Cageian musicians of chess, sitting quietly
   for the entire duration of their incarnations. They appear in
   "explosions" and disappear either in annihilations or by capture, the
   latter case ending the game in defeat for their armies.

   <p>Each traveled chessman appears on the chessboard simultaneously with a
   traveling chessman of the same piece type, in an explosion. In the
   very first move of a traveled chessman's appearance, the move that is
   part of an explosion, the traveled chessman has a restriction upon his
   ability to capture, but for every move thereafter the traveled
   chessman moves exactly like a chessman of standard chess.

   <p>There are three types of moves: the explosion, the normal move, and
   the annihilation. The player to move makes one move of one of these
   types. A player's move only directly affects chessmen of the player's
   assigned color except when the move is a normal move that captures an
   enemy piece or an explosion that captures an enemy piece.

  <h>The Explosion

   <p>An explosion requires an "explosion square". An explosion square is an
   empty square reachable in no more than three moves by a friendly
   untraveled chessman of the piece-type of interest. Such an untraveled
   piece is called an "explosion support", and there is an additional
   requirement that after each explosion a player causes, there must be
   at least one way to pair past explosions with associated explosion
   supports such that no two explosions are paired with the same
   explosion support. For instance, if the player to move wishes to cause
   a "rook explosion" at a given square, the given square must be empty
   and the player must have at least one untraveled rook (or pawn that
   could promote to rook) on the board which, in the hypothetical
   circumstance that the player were allowed to make moves in succession,
   could reach the given square, as untraveled rook, in no more than
   three total moves. (These hypothetical moves could include captures of
   enemy chessmen. Some of the moves also could be of friendly chessmen
   other than the rook, in order to free lines for the rook.) Further, at
   least one of these explosion supports must not have been required to
   justify an earlier explosion.

   <p>There is one final requirement for a square to serve as an explosion
   square. This requirement introduces the term "resonator". A resonator
   is any untraveled chessman which could possibly annihilate with an
   existing traveling chessman. (See the discussion of annihilation
   below.) The requirement is that a traveled chessman of the piece-type
   of interest can move from the explosion square without capturing an
   enemy traveling chessman or a resonator.

   <p>The player to move causes an explosion by placing traveling and
   traveled chessmen of the same piece-type on a qualified explosion
   square and then making a legal move with the traveled chessman without
   capturing a traveling chessman or a resonator. When the explosion has
   been accomplished two new, friendly chessmen are on the board. A
   traveling chessman has appeared on the explosion square. A traveled
   chessman of the same piece-type has appeared one legal move from the
   explosion square. The traveled chessman may or may not have captured
   an enemy chessman but certainly has not captured either a traveling
   chessman or a resonator. For the new traveling chessman there will be
   at least one friendly resonator of the same piece type no more than
   three moves distant.

  <h>The Normal Move

   <p>Traveling chessmen may not move, but untraveled and traveled chessmen
   make normal moves exactly like their counterparts in standard chess.
   Untraveled, traveling, and traveled chessmen may all be captured as in
   standard chess. In normal moves, traveled chessmen are not restricted
   from capturing enemy traveling chessmen or resonators. That
   restriction only applies during an explosion.

  <h>The Annihilation

   <p>In standard chess, chessmen are blocked by friendly chessmen; a
   chessman may replace an enemy but not a friend. This rule largely
   obtains in time traveler's chess also, but there is a single, very
   major exception. In time traveler's chess a traveling chessman does
   not block a friendly resonator of the same piece-type. A resonator one
   move away from an traveling chessman of the same piece-type may move
   onto the square occupied by the traveling chessman. When that happens,
   both chessmen vanish; both leave the board permanently. This event is
   an annihilation.

   <p>We can now round out our exposition of the rules of time traveler's
   chess by discussing grammatical correctness, checkmate, winning, and
   odds and ends.

  <h>Grammatical Correctness

   <p>The grammatical rules reflect the fact that traveling chessmen are
   supposed to be annihilated, that the player undertaking an explosion
   is obliged to make this happen. At any time the position of a player's
   pieces is either grammatically correct or grammatically incorrect. If
   a player has caused no explosions, his position automatically is
   grammatically correct. If a player has lost a traveling chessman to
   enemy capture, his position automatically is grammatically incorrect.
   If a player has caused one or more explosions but has not lost a
   traveling chessman, his position is grammatically correct if and only
   if there is a theoretical possibility that each of his traveling
   chessmen on the board can be annihilated. It is illegal for a player
   to make a move that leaves his position grammatically incorrect.
   Otherwise it is legal - and very desirable - for the player to force
   his opponent's position into grammatical incorrectness.

  <h>Checkmate

   <p>A player with one or more traveling chessmen is said to have an
   "unresolved" position. A player to move is in check if and only if he
   is under one-move threat of having no king (or else of having both an
   untraveled king and a traveling King but no traveled king) at the same
   time that his opponent has a resolved position. If this one-move
   threat is unanswerable, the player also is in checkmate.

   <p>Thus, a player might lose his king without ever being placed in check!
   And he can play on, kingless, so long as he can prevent resolution by
   his opponent!

  <h>Winning

   <p>A player wins by checkmate or by forcing his opponent into grammatical
   incorrectness.

  <h>Odds and Ends

   <p>Castling is legal in time traveler's chess as in standard chess and
   under the same strictures, but with check being defined as above. The
   rook and king must be untraveled, of course.

   <p>En passant capture is legal in time traveler's chess as in standard
   chess and under the same strictures. Since an annihilation is always
   initiated by a move of an untraveled chessman, an en passant capture
   can on occasion "undo" an annihilation.

   <p>An advanced untraveled pawn can be the explosion support of a
   traveling chessman of piece-type other than pawn by virtue of
   promotion.

   <p>An untraveled pawn promotes to an untraveled piece. A traveled pawn
   promotes to a traveled piece.

   <p>As in standard chess, the game is drawn by stalemate if the player to
   move has a grammatically correct position and is not in check but can
   make no move without placing himself in check (as defined above).

   <p>A traveling chessmen, despite its weirdness is a real piece. No piece
   of either color can move through it as if it were not there.

<h>Notation

   <p>A simple extension of the algebraic notation of standard chess is
   sufficient to record time traveler's chess games. Double slashes mean
   annihilation. Thus an annihilation involving squares d2 and d4 would
   be expressed as "d2//d4". A single slash indicates an explosion. The
   format is piece-type followed by explosion square followed by slash
   followed by other square. The move "Qd4/g7" is a queen explosion with
   explosion square d4. A White, noncapturing pawn explosion on h3 goes
   "h3/h4".

<h>Illustrative Games

  <h>Game 1

   <p>1.Nf6/e8 This move is legal. The explosion square f6 was empty as
   required, and f6 has an appropriate explosion support, the knight on
   b1. The knight on b1 is an explosion support because it can reach f6
   in three moves. It is also true that the movement of the traveled
   knight from f6 to e8 met the requirement of not capturing a traveling
   piece or a resonator. So, the move is legal. Legal but bad. 1...gf 0-1
   White's position is now grammatically incorrect, so White loses.
   Notice, by the way, that Black lost his king but was never in check.
   He was not in check because it would have taken more than one move for
   White to achieve a resolved position.

  <h>Game 2

   <p>1.e4 d6 Pirc alert: the Pirc doesn't work. 2.Bb5/e8+ Check, because
   White has captured Black's King and now threatens to resolve in one
   move. 2...d4/d3 There is no meaningful defense for Black. 3.Bxd3+
   Again check. Now Black can delay mate for exactly one move more, by
   intervening on c4. Quiz: How many different chessmen can Black now
   place on c4? 3...Qe6/c4 Answer: Four: Q,QB,QN,QBP. 4.Bxc4++ 1-0 It's
   checkmate because Black is kingless and cannot prevent the resolving
   annihilation on White's next move. Remember, the resonator on c4 and
   the traveling chessman on b5 are immune to immediate capture by an
   exploding traveled piece. The game is over, but let's now contemplate
   what has happened from the noumenal point of view. To facilitate this
   contemplation, let's pretend that White has made that forbidden final,
   fifth move and has thus reified the royal murder. What has happened?
   Okay, the WKB sat on his original square until move three. On move
   three he sprang to the square d3, capturing a pawn. On move four he
   captured a queen on c4. On move five he leapt to b5 and immediately
   began to time travel. He time traveled (in place, of course, since
   traveling pieces do not move) back to move four, then to move three,
   then to move two. On move two he turned forward again in time and
   immediately rushed to e8, capturing the Black monarch.

  <h>Game 3

   <p>1.e4 e5 2.d4/e5 White, trying to use time travel to obtain a
   dominating center, counts on a quick annihilation to avoid grammatical
   problems. 2...c5! But this counterattack places White in grave danger.
   If now 3.d2//d4 then 3...Qa5/e1 leads to a quick checkmate. White is
   now forced to capture on c5 via time travel, but his grammatical
   difficulties naturally snowball. 3.b4/c5 Nc6 Attacking two traveling
   chessmen. If either is captured the game is over. 4.Bb5/c6 dxc Black
   now attacks two traveling chessmen with two different pieces. It's
   hopeless. 5.Qh5/f7 This desperate move does not help in the least.
   Black is not in check because White is not resolved. Qxd4 0-1 White
   has lost grammatical correctness.

  <h>Game 4

   <p>1.e4 e5 2.Nf3/e5 Nc6/e5 3.d4/e5 b8//c6 4.d2//d4 White has set a trap,
   into which Black now falls. 4...Bb4/e1 5.Qd6! cxd6 6.a3 dxe5 7.axb4
   1-0
