                            <h>WEBELOS CEREMONIES!

                             

                           <h>We'll Be Loyal Scouts!

   <p>The Webelos den is unique in several respects.

   <p>First, it includes all the fourth- and fifth-grade boys in the pack.
   Second, Webelos Scouts wear uniforms that are different from those of
   younger Cub Scouts. Third, Webelos Scouts do not work on achievements
   and electives; they have their own activity badge areas to master.
   Fourth, their goals are the Webelos badge and Arrow of Light Award,
   which signify that they are ready to become Boy Scouts when they reach
   the age of 11 (or are 10-1/2 and have completed fifth grade).

   <p>There are other differences, too, but these four offer the best
   opportunities for ceremonies that recognize the unique status of the
   Webelos Scout.

   <p>Every Webelos ceremony should help the Webelos Scout anticipate the
   fun and adventure he will have as a Boy Scout. The rank should bring
   to the Webelos Scout and his parents a feeling of preparation for
   Scouting.

   <h>PERSONNEL
   <p>Webelos den leader; Webelos den chief, the transferring Cub Scout, his
   den leader and his parents; members of Webelos den to hold flags.

   <h>EQUIPMENT
   <p>The pack flag; the transferring Cub Scout's den flag; the Webelos den
   flag; the Webelos cap; neckerchief

   <p>Webelos Den Leader: Tonight we welcome Bear Cub Scout [name] into our
   Webelos den. He has completed the third grade and has shown himself
   worthy by working hard through the Wolf and Bear Cub Scout ranks.
   Before we call Cub Scout [name] and his parents forward, I will ask
   that the pack flag and his former den flag and the flag of his Webelos
   den be brought to the center of the stage. (Members of the Webelos den
   present the flags.)

   <p>Now, will Bear Cub Scout [name] come forward with his parents and den
   leader.

   <p>Den Chief: [Den leader's name], will you please present Bear Cub Scout
   [name] with his new Webelos neckerchief

   <p>Den Chief: [Name], we welcome you into our Webelos den. You're sure to
   have fun with us because we do lots of exciting things, like hikes and
   overnight campouts.

   <p>Wear your Webelos neckerchief proudly. It means you've taken another
   step along the Scouting trail.

   <p>Webelos Den Leader: And now, Bear Cub Scout [name], we want to give
   you the other part of the Webelos uniform, the Webelos cap. It will
   tell everybody that you are an older boy, getting ready for the
   adventures of Boy Scouting. The Webelos cap will hold the activity
   badges you earn as you explore the Webelos trail. Welcome to our
   Webelos den. Now I believe your former den leader wants to say a few
   words.

   <p>Den Leader: [Name], we have enjoyed having you with us in Den
   [number]. I'm sure you'll do as well in the Webelos den as you have in
   ours. Your former den mates wish you good luck as you move farther
   along the Scouting trail. (He or she salutes or shakes hands with
   him.)

   <p>Webelos Den Leader: [New Webelos Scouts parents], you have helped
   [name] this far along the Cub Scout trail. It is important now that
   you continue to stay with him and become thoroughly familiar with the
   Scouting trail in our Webelos den. We will soon have the pleasure, we
   know, of seeing you present your son with activity badges, the Webelos
   badge, and finally, the Arrow of Light Award, the highest award in Cub
   Scouting. (The pack gives its yell and the group retires to their
   seats.)

   <h>ARRANGEMENT
   <p>The Webelos Scouts, holding their letters, form a semicircle with
   their backs toward the audience. The Cubmaster and the Webelos den
   leader (and any other Webelos Scouts) stand. The Cubmaster invites the
   Bear Cub Scout who is entering the Webelos den to come forward; he
   introduces him to each Webelos Scout and the Webelos den leader, and
   each gives him the Cub Scout handshake. One by one, each boy in the
   semicircle turns to face the audience, holds his letter shoulder-high,
   and recites his line.

   <p>lst Scout: Well be loyal Scouts.

   <p>2nd Scout: Each Scout earns his own activity badges.

   <p>3rd Scout: Boys are in the fourth and fifth grades.

   <p>4th Scout: Every Scout can earn the Webelos badge and Arrow of Light
   Award.

   <p>5th Scout: Love of God and country we will show.

   <p>6th Scout: On our honor, we will do our best.

   <p>7th Scout: Scouts are friendly and helpful, at home, at school, and in
   the community.

   <p>(In succession, the boys repeat their letters.)

   <p>All: Webelos - We'll be loyal Scouts!




                          <h>Welcome, Bear Cub Scout
            Author: Staging Den and Pack Ceremonies (BSA 33212)

   <h>PERSONNEL
   <p>Cubmaster; Webelos den leader; Webelos den chief; the transferring Cub
   Scout, his den leader, and his parents; member of Webelos den to hold
   the pack flag.

   <h>EQUIPMENT
   <p>Pack flag, the transferring Cub Scout's den flag, Webelos den flag,
   Webelos neckerchief and slide, a copy of the Webelos Scout Book.

   <p>Cubmaster: Tonight we have a Bear Cub Scout who is transferring to the
   Webelos den. Before we call this boy and his parents forward, I will
   ask that our pack flag be brought to the center of the stage, and that
   Webelos Den Leader [name] and Webelos Den Chief [name] come forward
   with the Webelos den flag. (When they are in position Cubmaster
   continues.)

   <p>Now will Bear Cub Scout [name] come forward with his parents and den
   leader and stand at the left of our pack flag? (If he is new to Cub
   Scouting, adapt accordingly.)

   <p>Webelos Den Leader [name], will you please explain the purpose of the
   Webelos den?

   <p>Webelos Den Leader: Our Webelos den has one big purpose. That's to
   prepare our Webelos Scouts for Boy Scouting. We work on exciting
   activity badge areas, learning things that may lead us to lifelong
   hobbies or vocations. At the same time, we study the Boy Scout
   requirements so the boys will be ready to become Boy Scouts when they
   are eligible.

   <p>Our Webelos den meets at my home (gives address, time, and day of the
   week.)

   <p>We participate in all regular pack activities, work on selected
   activity badges, and work toward finishing the requirements for the
   Webelos badge and Arrow of Light Award. We also visit Boy Scout troops
   in our neighborhood to help our boys decide which troop they wish to
   join.

   <p>We have made a promise to our boys to help them know the great
   outdoors and to go on hikes and overnight camping trips every year
   with their adult partners. This Webelos den activity starts the
   Webelos Scouts along the outdoor Scouting trail.

   <p>I will call on our Webelos den chief to present the Webelos
   neckerchief. (Webelos den chief steps forward with Webelos den flag,
   which he hands to the Webelos den leader to hold.)

   <p>Webelos Den Chief: [Boy's name], we welcome you into our Webelos den.
   We have fun as we practice, and learn the activity badges and Boy
   Scout requirements. As we work and play together, a lot will be
   expected of you. I am happy to present to you your Webelos
   neckerchief. Here is your Webelos Scout Book. Its pages will lead you
   into many hours of pleasure and knowledge. May it be your constant
   companion. Welcome to our Webelos den.

   <p>(Adapt the following to suit if the boy is new to Cub Scouting.)

   <p>Webelos Den Leader: [Name], your former den leader, extends the best
   wishes of your old den.

   <p>Den Leader: [Boy's name], Den [number] has been glad to have you as a
   member. We have had much fun together. Now, your former den mates wish
   you much happiness and success in your new den. (He or she salutes or
   shakes hands with him.)

   <p>Cubmaster: [Cub Scout's parents' names] have helped [boy's name] along
   the Cub Scout trail this far. It is important now that you continue to
   stay with him and become thoroughly familiar with the Scouting trail
   in our Webelos den. We will soon have the pleasure, we know, of seeing
   you present your son with the Arrow of Light Award. (The pack gives
   yell and the group retires.)






                        <h>Indian Webelos Den Induction
            Author: Staging Den and Pack Ceremonies (BSA 33212)

   <h>PERSONNEL
   <p>Pack advancement chairman or Webelos den leader, Indian scout (den
   chief), Indian chief (Webelos den leader), Bear Cub Scouts, Indian
   drummer, Webelos den members.

   <h>EQUIPMENT
   <p>Indian drum; artificial campfire; peace pipe; Indian costumes; Webelos
   neckerchiefs, slides, and caps; copies of Webelos Scout Book.

   <h>ARRANGEMENT
   <p>The Webelos den members in Indian costumes sit on the floor in a
   circle around the artificial campfire. The Indian chief stands in a
   prominent position and the Indian drummer stands to one side or sits
   in the circle. The Indian scout stands in front of the circle.

   <p>Advancement Chairman: (As the drum is sounded with a soft "boom,
   boom:" he comes to the center of the room.) Scouts of the Webelos
   tribe, we have [number] boys who wish to enter the Webelos circle.

   <p>Indian Scout: Who do you have?

   <p>Advancement Chairman: I have Bear Cub Scouts [names] of Den [number].

   <p>Indian Scout: Come forward, Bears [names]. (Boom of the drum is heard
   as the boys advance toward him.) Give the Cub Scout salute. (The boys
   do so.) Give the Cub Scout handshake. (The boys do so. The drum booms
   again as the Indian scout escorts the boys to the Indian chief. They
   stand on his right.)

   <p>Indian Chief: Do I hear the South Wind?

   <p>Webelos Scout: I am the South Wind. I wish you good Scouting. Over
   hill and dale I have carried stories of you and your Cub Scout
   experiences. As Cub Scouts you have been happy, game, and fair, and a
   credit to your den and pack.

   <p>Indian Chief: Do I hear the East Wind?

   <p>Webelos Scout: I am the East Wind. I wish you well. I have spread the
   story of your fun and happiness as Bobcats, Wolves, and Bears in Cub
   Scouting with Pack [number], and how you lived up to the Cub Scout
   promise.

   <p>Indian Chief: Do I hear the West Wind?

   <p>Webelos Scout: I am the West Wind. I would like everyone to know that
   these Cub Scouts going into the Webelos den did not walk the trail of
   Cub Scouting alone. Each had the wonderful help of his parents. Please
   continue to help your Cub Scouts go, and also to grow.

   <p>Indian Chief: What are all the winds saying?

   <p>Webelos Scouts: (All the winds in unison.) We will be with you
   forever. We wish you the best of luck in the Webelos den.

   <p>Indian Chief: The purpose of the Webelos den is to help our boys earn
   the Webelos badge and Cub Scouting's highest award, the Arrow of Light
   Award, and to help them become Boy Scouts when they are eligible.

   <p>Webelos Den Leader: Our Webelos den meets at [location] on [give day
   of the week and time], and we have meetings and trips on Saturdays. We
   will also have activities with Boy Scout troops. As you notice in the
   Webelos Scout Book, we work on Webelos activity badges. I will be
   calling upon each of you parents to assist me with one of the activity
   badge areas. Now I would like to award Cub Scout [name] his Webelos
   neckerchief and slide, his Webelos Scout Book, and Webelos cap.

   <h>PERSONNEL
   <p>Cubmaster, Webelos leader, Bear Cub Scouts.

   <h>EQUIPMENT
   <p>Indian headbands; Webelos neckerchiefs, slides, and caps; council
   fire; bridge; copies of Webelos Scout Book.

   <h>ARRANGEMENT
   <p>The Bear Cub Scouts are sitting at the council fire.

   <p>Cubmaster: Bears, you have in the past worked on the Wolf trail and
   your most recent adventures have been on the Bear trail. You have
   proven yourselves to be good Scouts. You have now earned the honor of
   joining our Webelos council fire.

   <p>(The Bears are called up and cross over the bridge. They are given a
   Webelos neckerchief, neckerchief slide, book, and Webelos cap.)

   <p>Cubmaster: Congratulations, young braves. You will find lots of fun
   and adventures ahead of you.






                               <h>Engineer Badge
            Author: Staging Den and Pack Ceremonies (BSA 33212)

   <p>Webelos Scouts may earn a variety of activity badges during their year
   in the den. These activity badges are: Aquanaut, Artist, Athlete,
   Citizen, Communicator, Craftsman, Engineer, Family Member, Fitness,
   Forester, Geologist, Handyman, Naturalist, Outdoorsman, Readyman,
   Scholar, Scientist, Showman, Sportsman, Traveler.

   <p>The Webelos den leader will be focusing on one of these areas each
   month, so it may happen that you will have several boys who have
   earned the same activity badge. If so, this is an opportunity for a
   ceremony involving an outside expert in the subject. Take this
   opportunity, if possible, because it will lead to variety in your
   ceremonies.

   <p>While there is no national recognition of the boy who qualifies for
   all activity badges, many local packs recognize the Webelos Scout in a
   special way when he earns all of the activity badges.

   <p>Here is an example of a ceremony you might develop for awarding a
   single activity badge to several Webelos Scouts, and one for use when
   you have several different activity badges to present.

   <h>PERSONNEL
   <p>Webelos den leader, an engineer, Webelos Scouts who have earned the
   badge, parents.

   <h>EQUIPMENT
   <p>The drawings, sketches, blocks and tackles, catapults, etc., made by
   the Webelos Scouts; Engineer activity badges; safety pins.

   <p>Den Leader: For the past 2 months our den has been working at home and
   in our meetings on the Engineer activity badge. I'm happy to say that
   [number] of the boys have passed the requirements and earned this
   badge. Will Webelos Scouts [names] and their parents please come
   forward.

   <p>With us tonight is [name], an engineer with [name of company], who
   will present the badges.

   <p>Engineer: Boys, I have looked over the requirements for the Engineer
   activity badge in your Webelos Scout Book, and I must say that you
   have done fine work in meeting them. Your work on this badge will be a
   good basis to start from if any of you decide to become engineers.
   Now, Pd like to see how the things you made work. (The Webelos Scouts
   show catapults, blocks and tackles, drawings, and sketches for all to
   see.)

   <p>That's excellent! I'm proud to see that you have learned engineering
   principles so well.

   <p>I now take pleasure in presenting these Engineer activity badges to
   your parents, who will fasten them onto your Webelos cap.






                                <h>Artist Badge
            Author: Staging Den and Pack Ceremonies (BSA 33212)

   <p>Webelos Scouts may earn a variety of activity badges during their year
   in the den. These activity badges are: Aquanaut, Artist, Athlete,
   Citizen, Communicator, Craftsman, Engineer, Family Member, Fitness,
   Forester, Geologist, Handyman, Naturalist, Outdoorsman, Readyman,
   Scholar, Scientist, Showman, Sportsman, Traveler.

   <p>Here is an example of a ceremony you might develop for awarding a
   single activity badge to several Webelos Scouts, and one for use when
   you have several different activity badges to present.

   <h>PERSONNEL
   <p>Webelos den leader, an artist, Webelos Scouts who have earned the
   badge, parents.

   <h>EQUIPMENT
   <p>Blackboard or easel and paper, chalk or pencil, Artist activity
   badges.

   <p>Artist: Boys, I have looked over your work carefully, and I find it
   very good indeed. You have shown real skill in meeting the
   requirements for the Artist activity badge. It is a great pleasure for
   me to give these badges to your parents, who will fasten them on your
   Webelos cap. (After the parents have taken the badges, the artist
   returns to the blackboard or easel.) Now, if you don't mind, I'll get
   back to my doodling. I'm curious to find out what it is myself.

   <p>Den Leader: We are very proud of our Webelos Scouts, and we hope that
   more members of our den will earn this badge by next month. Meanwhile,
   these boys and other members of the den will be starting work on
   another of our exciting activity badges. (As he speaks, the artist
   completes a drawing of the Arrow of Light. The den leader continues to
   talk about the work of the Webelos den until the artist finishes the
   sketch.) It's the Arrow of Light!

   <p>Were you a Cub Scout, [name of artist]?

   <p>Artist: No, the idea just came to me in a flash - with a little help
   from the badge that Webelos Scout over there is wearing.

   <p>Den Leader: Well, it's a wonderful ideal because the Arrow of Light is
   the badge that every member of our den is striving for. The Arrow of
   Light means that a Webelos Scout is really ready for the big step into
   the high adventure of Boy Scouting. And now, [name of artist], I'd
   like to thank you for coming tonight, and I hope you will stay after
   the meeting to talk with our Webelos Scouts and their parents.

   <p>And, congratulations, artists! (The pack gives a cheer.)






                          <h>Presentation of Several
                              Activity Badges
            Author: Staging Den and Pack Ceremonies (BSA 33212)

   <h>PERSONNEL
   <p>Webelos den leader, den chief, Webelos Scouts who have earned activity
   badges, parents.

   <h>EQUIPMENT
   <p>Arrow of Light ceremonial board with one small candle for each
   activity badge to be presented plus one large candle, and the activity
   badges.

   <p>Den Leader: Four members of our Webelos den have earned activity
   badges this month. They are: [name], who has earned the Craftsman
   badge; [name], the Geologist badge; and [name] and [name], both of
   whom earned the Showman badge. Will these Webelos Scouts please come
   forward with their parents?

   <p>Now, then, I will ask Den Chief [name] to light one of the small
   candles for each activity badge. Webelos Scout [name], you have earned
   the Craftsman badge. To do that, you mastered many tools and made
   several toys and useful items. I congratulate you on your new skills.
   (Hands the badge to the parents as the den chief lights the first
   candle.)

   <p>Webelos Scout [name], you have earned the Geologist badge. You had to
   learn a great deal about the earth and its composition, and you
   learned how rocks and minerals are useful to us. My congratulations to
   you. (Hands the badge to the parents as the den chief lights the
   second candle.)

   <p>Webelos Scouts [name] and [name], both of you have earned the Showman
   badge, proving your ability in entertainment. [Name] earned the badge
   for his fine work with puppets, and [name] for his talent and
   knowledge of music. I congratulate you both. (Hands the badges to the
   parents while the den chief lights the third candle.)

   <p>Now, Den Chief [name], shall we light the big candle?

   <p>Den Chief: No, sir.

   <p>Den Leader: Why not?

   <p>Den Chief: Because the big candle stands for the Arrow of Light Award.

   <p>Den Leader: That's right, [name]. This big candle is for the Arrow of
   Light Award, the highest in Cub Scouting. It must remain unlit until
   we have a Webelos Scout who has completed the Arrow of Light
   requirements. Then we will light that candle. These small candles,
   representing the activity badge areas, are simply steps in the
   development of Webelos Scouts. They are important in themselves, but
   they lead us to the biggest prize that a Cub Scout can earn, the Arrow
   of Light Award.

   <p>Now, Den Chief [name], will you lead the Webelos Scouts in your den
   yell?

            Author: Staging Den and Pack Ceremonies (BSA 33212)

   <h>PERSONNEL
   <p>Cubmaster, Webelos leader, Webelos Scouts, and their parents.

   <h>EQUIPMENT
   <p>Webelos badges, safety pins.

   <p>Cubmaster: When our boys become Cub Scouts, they work to earn four
   badges to form a diamond on their left pocket. First they must earn
   their Bobcat badge. Next, they earn the Wolf badge and then they go on
   to achieve the Bear badge.

   <p>The final part of the Cub Scout diamond is earned as they move up the
   Scouting trail into the Webelos den. Our Webelos leader will tell us
   what is required to earn this badge.

   <p>Webelos Leader: The Webelos badge is earned by having an adult family
   member read and sign the Parent Guide in his Webelos Scout Book, by
   being active in the den for 3 months, by explaining the meaning of the
   Webelos badge, by explaining the parts of the Webelos uniform, by
   earning Fitness and two other activity badges, by planning and leading
   a flag ceremony in his den, by understanding the requirements for
   becoming a Boy Scout, and by becoming actively involved in his own
   religious faith. He must also understand and agree to follow the
   Outdoor Code.

   <p>This step on the Scouting trail prepares our boys to earn the highest
   Cub Scout award, the Arrow of Light, and move on. to a Boy Scout
   troop.

   <p>Tonight, Webelos Scout [name] has earned this final section of the
   diamond.

   <p>Will Webelos Scout [name] and his parents please come forward. (They
   do.)

   <p>Webelos Scout [name], you have completed the activity badges (name
   them), and demonstrated that you understand the Scout Oath, Law,
   motto, and slogan. You have also learned the Scout sign and handshake
   along with the Scout salute, and completed the other requirements of
   this badge.

  <p> I am very pleased to present this Webelos badge to your parents to pin
   on your uniform. (Repeat this for each Webelos Scout who receives the
   badge.)

   <p>Cubmaster: We are very proud of the Webelos Scouts who have received
   the Webelos badge tonight. The final step as a Cub Scout before
   graduating to a Boy Scout troop will be to earn the Arrow of Light
   Award. I look forward to presenting this to you in the future.

   <p>Congratulations!

   <h>ARRANGEMENT
   <p>The Webelos leader and Webelos Scouts present themselves at the front

   ceremony.

   <p>Webelos Den Leader: Will [names of participating Webelos Scouts]
   please give the Scout sign, and repeat the correct phrase of the Scout
   Oath.

   <p>Webelos Scouts: (In unison.) On my honor ...

   <p>Webelos Den Leader: An assurance I make, a pledge to do right, I keep
   it before me, a bright shining light

   <p>Webelos Scouts: I will do my best ...

   <p>Webelos Den Leader: I'll try my best to do it, though difficult it may
   be, and if I keep my promise, then folks will believe in me.

   <p>Webelos Scouts: To do my duty to God and my country ...

   <p>Webelos Den Leader: To God, the creator, and a country so mighty; my
   reverence, my loyalty, forever I guarantee.

   <p>Webelos Scouts: And to obey the Scout Law ...

   <p>Webelos Den Leader: The 12 points of the Scout Law are the rules of
   the game; to become a useful citizen, that is my aim.

   <p>Webelos Scouts: To help other people at all times ...

   <p>Webelos Den Leader: The young, the old, many people need me; a cheery
   smile, a helping hand, of service I will be.

  <p> Webelos Scouts: To keep myself physically strong....

 <p>  Webelos Den Leader: Building endurance, building strength, being
   careful, my body will serve me well if I am thoughtful.

  <p> Webelos Scouts: Mentally awake....

  <p>vWebelos Den Leader: My mind is important, a tool to keep keen; to be
   always alert and ready to learn.

   <p>Webelos Scouts: And morally straight.

   <p>Webelos Den Leader: I'll strive to be honest, clean, and faithful, my
   character unblemished. All good and true values I want a part of me
   when I've finished.

   <p>(The Cubmaster calls the parents forward. With congratulations and a
   Cub Scout handshake, the Webelos badges are presented to the parents,
   who in turn present them to their boys.)
