   <h>Tyrone
   <p>The "Back Where I Started From" tour dates have been announced,
   starting MID-OCTOBER thru to EARLY NOVEMBER. Visit Ty's website (see
   link below) for more info!
   <p>Tyrone returns to the public arena with his most exciting record to
   date, the 6-track mini-album Heavy Soul Part 1, released nationally
   (Australia) through Jellyfish/MGM on September 16 2006.
   <p>An evocative combination of pop, rock, groove and soul influences,
   Tyrones solo work proves both radio-friendly and deeply personal.
   On his debut single Back (Where I Started From), Noonan gives an
   emotionally raw subject the alchemists treatment - he takes lifes
   harsh lessons and wrings a melody out of them.
   Noonan's pop credentials are augmented by the considerable talent of
   David Nicholas and Michael Stangel, working together as Jellyfish
   Music. Having produced/engineered for INXS, Midnight Oil, Elton John,
   Sting, Pulp, Ash, The Veronicas, Soul Asylym and of course george,
   they've won ARIA awards and more.
   Before embarking on his solo project Tyrone was busy doing soundtrack
   work for film/theatre, collaborating with avant garde group Topology,
   performing with his jazz/latin/soul band Palimpsest
    and also several local solo/DJ gigs.

      
   <h>Katie
   <p>Katie is currently working on her solo album, due out in 2007. Keep
   your ears listening for the single that should be released in summer,
   2006. Collaborating with some great musicians from all around the
   world this album is destined to be a joy to listen to and with a tour
   planned around the release, Katie will surely have some amazing
   musical surprises in store for all. As well as writing and recording
   the album, Katie is enjoying being a Mum to Dexter and wife to Isaac.

   <h>PaulieB
   PaulieB and the Neighbourhood Groove Collective can be seen at various
   hotspots in Brisbane. Be sure to sign up to their newsletter to be
   informed of all their upcoming gigs www.m8sr8srecords.com. You can

   <h>   Unity

   <p> It's been
   an adventurous eighteen months for Brisbane's george (Katie Noonan,
   Tyrone Noonan, Geoff Green, Paulie Bromley and Nick Stewart) since the
   release of their double-platinum debut album, Polyserena. However the
   roller coaster polarity of hard work and personal space, of external
   pressures and internal joys, of the expectations from the world and
   the ideals of the band have all culminated in a remarkably well
   realised second release in Unity.

   <p>Refusing to ride on the successful formula that saw singles such as
   Special Ones, Run and Breathe In Now achieve critical acclaim, george
   have broadened their musical scope. They're exploring different sounds
   from the introspective, getting back to the acoustic joy of five
   musicians and then taking the songs where they will - whether it is a
   simple melody and guitar line or the grandiose splendour of a huge
   symphonic sound.

   <p>"I personally feel like I've developed a lot as a songwriter,"
   comments Tyrone, "more confident lyrics and statements being expressed
   through those lyrics. Overall it's a more positive approach in dealing
   with personal issues and socio-political issues, more positive light.
   As a band, this to me feels like a really mature album for us. I feel
   like the five of us have really connected stronger than ever before
   musically as a unit."

   <p>"The album is a combination of all of the recording practice we'd all
   done," adds Paulie. "george have always prided themselves on high
   quality recordings, and individually Unity was my sixth or seventh
   full length album to record with a band. We were all completely
   comfortable with who we were for each other, and that was something we
   really learned on the first record. Polyserena was us learning how to
   make a record, Unity was making that record."

   <p>Working hand in hand with producer David Nicholas and assistant Justin
   Tresidder (additional production and engineering), both of whom also
   worked on Polyserena, everyone felt a sense of comfort and intimacy
   during the recording session that occurred in the beautiful surrounds
   of Byron Bay. Melbourne's revered composer Paul Grabowsky also
   assisted with sweeping orchestral and horn arrangements, lending the
   music a dignity that refrained from falling into pretension. Songs
   like first single Still Real and Today examine people's relationships
   with their own lives, as well as providing a touching insight into the
   band themselves.

   <p>"I think that sense of friendship comes from the early days of george,
   in that it was about two sets of siblings, so it was about family and
   love and very close, intense relationships," considers Katie. "That
   family vibe brings a closeness and honesty that permeates what we do.
   Collectively and individually, we've been through a great period of
   change and growth. Knowing we can look to each other for strength
   brings comfort and solidarity. We have all been through the same thing
   and there's an incredible sense of union from that experience - that's
   what being in a band's about."

   <p>It's a perspective that has seen this band survive more than seven
   years now. "The essence of george was a couple of sets of siblings
   getting together for the sake of music, and both the Noonan family and
   Stewart family had musical parents who were very passionate about
   letting their children find what made them happy and how to achieve
   what they wanted to achieve in life," explains Nick. "From the very
   onset, Ty, Katie and myself have had that passion and goal, and that's
   definitely where Unity comes from. It's a musical search that with
   complete support from our parents, we've been able to pursue, and it's
   likewise for Paulie and Geoff. That came very much to the forefront
   just before we came in to record this album. It signifies that after
   all the success that Polyserena had, the basic formula was happiness
   in music, and that's where we come from and where we're going to and
   what Unity encapsulates. All five of us very strongly feel that way."

   <p>That sentiment of strength and focus is apparent throughout the record
   - despite moments of darkness and questioning, musically the
   overriding force is that of positivity and seeking out that silver
   lining. "It's meant to be universal," asserts Katie. "There's been an
   extreme amount of emotional intensity in the world over the last two
   years, but I feel people are now starting to look to each other again.
   I'm feeling that anyway. We're feeling that uneasy political
   turbulence, that sadness of seeing our brothers and sisters in war. So
   I guess it's not meant to be just about unity for us, it's an everyone
   thing as well."

   <p>Unity. It conjures images of persistence, of sunshine, of hope. It
   signifies faith and motivates change. It's the album that george has
   been slowly and determinedly working towards for the past seven years
   and one that will serve to elevate them to their next goal.

   <p>Track by track with george

   <p>"Still Real"
   Katie: This is very much a reflection on the journey that we've been
   through in the last eighteen months as a band. We never really wrote
   music for commercial success - it was like a happy accident and we
   feel very lucky and blessed, but it was also very unexpected and it
   changed our lives a lot, individually and collectively. This song's a
   reflection on that huge period of growth and change that we've been
   through as a group and how basically we've learned to look to each
   other for strength and perspective. At the end of the day, what we do
   is a very simple thing - it's five people playing music purely because
   they love it.

   <p>"One"
   Tyrone: This a reflection on the times - the fall of Archbishop
   Hollingsworth, the Iraq War, the lies about the Tampa and what really
   happened in Floridabut it's also a positive look at the fact that we
   are all 99.9 per cent the same and that some, if not many, of us are
   waking up to what's going on, stepping outside the matrix of fear and
   remembering to smile! Musically, the chorus idea originally came from
   one of Nick's happening riffs, but classical composers including Elgar
   and Vaughan Williams inspired the rest of the song.

   <p>"Captive"
   Katie: This was a song that I wrote a very long time ago, we've been
   playing it live for about four years. It's a reflection on the need to
   get out of the city and the need to break free from the monotony of
   schedule and timetables and buses and taxis and deadlines. Just the
   need to get away from the stuff that holds you captive in your space
   in the city or wherever you may be. It was a great song to give Paul
   Grabowsky the chance to explore the orchestral arrangements in a
   really cinematic space.

   <p>Geoff: I don't think as a band we could have pulled it off recording
   it any earlier, I don't think that the vibe would have been captured.
   Nothing replaces just playing together, and we've done so much playing
   together that we all know where we fit and how to weave in and out of
   each other.

   <p>Nick: It's something we've always thought of as a studio track and
   something we wanted to have a good look at. At the end of the day
   during tracking I played my parts, but felt after listening back it
   was a bit 'boxy', or something was a bit not right. I went back in by
   myself, pulled the Marshall out of the 2m by 2m booth, took it into
   the big room where the drums are and turned it up to 11!

   <p>"Beauty Of All Things"
   Tyrone: This song is designed to put a smile on your face! No matter
   what trials and tribulations we all must face, love is stronger than
   any of these thingswith special thanks to the amazing Pinewood
   Studios/Herb Albert-inspired orchestration from Paul G and the superb
   playing of the Queensland Orchestra. Part of the inspiration of this
   song came from listening to lots of my favourite alternative pop
   records (yes, vinyl!) from the '80s. But thanks to Paul G I think
   we've ended up more in the late swingin' '60s!

   <p>Falling Inside
   Katie: It's been an amazing year and it's been a wonderful time of
   growth together and there are certain less artistic sides to our
   chosen path that we have to deal with, that probably in an ideal
   world, we'd prefer not to have to. When you're an artist it's often
   hard to make decisions about your art in that sense. It's a bit of a
   reflection on that and how unfortunate it is that it's sometimes a
   reality we have to deal with. But it's also meant to be positive and
   that it's kind of carefree and let go. It's a positive song because
   we've got through that period. It's fuelled a very happy, uplifting
   thing in the end.

   <p>Nick: It went through so many forms in the arrangement. We had these
   very different periods - the first time it had a much more riff based
   chorus. Then it lost its drunkenness!

   <p>Geoff: Paulie went down to a wrecker and got all sorts of metallic
   bits and pieces, and we were out on the verandah of Coorabella and we
   just started throwing things around. The cows were mooing and getting
   upset and I was getting the two wheel drums and playing them like
   symphonic cymbals and hitting things! In the end we just ended up
   diving on all the stuff and kind of rolling around that's all through
   the intro.

   <p>"Fortunate Smile"
   Tyrone: This is a love tale that started out almost like a folk song,
   with its 6/8 feel banged out on an acoustic. It's about those
   lighter-than-air feelings you get when you see your partner's smile or
   look into their eyes - and it's augmented by an amazing
   Indian-inspired string intro and Balanescu-inspired outro led by the
   wonderful Paul Grabowsky.

   <p>"Fall"
   Katie: I wrote this song earlier this year, so it was very new. It was
   just a very simple song, a reflection on other people's lives and also
   my own, but it's written in third person. I suppose I'm incapable of
   not feeling things 110 per cent, I'm just not capable of not letting
   things get to me, and that's in good and bad ways! I think we're all
   like that; we're all pretty sensitive. It was meant to be a
   metaphorical kind of thing, like when you've met somebody and you've
   fallen in love that's just the deepest degree of that emotion
   possible, and it's a reflection on that - there's been a lot of
   emotional intensity recently. In my life, but also just generally.

   <p>"Today"
   Tyrone: Be happy for today - that is the mantra of this song. While
   there is a yearning for an end to violence and greed, there is
   recognition that love is the greatest force on earth and that each day
   is a gift, no matter how much further we feel we have to go. The
   original idea came from a simple riff that just wouldn't go away
   whenever I sat in front of the piano; and even though it has a minor
   feel, the subtle change to major for the choruses just appeared one
   day and gave the song the lift I was looking for.

   <p>"Jaded"
   Katie: I wrote this years ago when we were on the road, when we'd been
   touring for a very, very long time. It comes back to the Falling
   Inside thing - not wanting to let other people make you jaded. For me
   this is Special Ones Part II. It's very much about self empowerment
   and self worth, and empowering in the sense of everyone has so much
   stuff in their life that if you wanted to let it get you down it
   could, whatever it is. It's not just about being in the music
   industry, it's just whatever it is about your life.

   <p>Geoff: It's such a positive reinforcement and that is the message that
   we're trying to get across throughout this whole album, just the
   positivity. Everyone has some element in their life and this song will
   hopefully transcend to all sorts of different people - and it might be
   relevant to race issues or anything, and hopefully the positive aspect
   will come through.

   <p>"Growing With Love"
   Tyrone: This is a reflection on learning the lessons that life has to
   offer, and remembering what we are here for. This is one of those
   songs that came together in the studio - we still weren't certain
   about where it was at by the end of pre-production - and then
   something happened when Dave (Nicholas, producer) started miking up
   the whole studio space and the four other members of george found a
   special groove.

   <p>Katie: This was something that couldn't have happened on a previous
   recording as well. We left it to the very last song, and the whole
   time we were thinking it would probably be a closing track of the
   record. For Ty and I, that's our favourite backing vocal moment. It
   was inspired by keening, a particular vocal technique that's all in
   the throat, and it's actually a style of singing used in mourning. I'm
   wondering if people will think it's other people!

   <p>"Surrender"
   Paulie: I've written a lot of music on my own and this was the first
   piece I felt really suited, more than anything, the line up of george.
   I'd only written the parts for one guitar, but had ideas for an
   accompaniment. I put together a basic arrangement of three or four
   sections that went loosely together, gave a copy to Katie who added a
   vocal melody and then joined that with a poem from Martin Challice
   (who also writes a lot of lyrics for Elixir, Katie and Nick's other
   project).

   <p>Katie: This was the first song that I wrote with Paulie B. He had this
   beautiful, revolving, languid, sensuous riff that the guys had
   recorded some music around instrumentally. I had a little walkman and
   I played it and sang along to the CD and it just happened. It's a very
   sensuous song and very thematic. It's also just about letting go
   emotionally and surrendering to everything. I ended up doing the
   lyrics at sunset, as the sun was setting on the deck. There were birds
   and everyone sitting around. The little birds were ***** around my
   head because I was near their nest and they were a little bit freaked
   out!

   <p>"Change"
   Tyrone: This is the first song written in the rehearsal space with the
   four boys. Nick had the riff going and it all evolved naturally from
   there. The song reflects on the idea of finding a way to work within
   the system and effect positive change without letting it change you.

   <p>Nick: A lot of my personal writing was done at Woodford with my twin
   brother; we would grab a couple of acoustics and sit around the camp
   playing for hours on end. Change started there for me. I got some
   chords together with him and worked on it as an acoustic piece. When I
   got it to george everyone said let's rip it apart and put it back
   together - as we always do! That's the wondrous thing with george. For
   me, this is one of the best expressions of the group. The guitar is
   not a feature, just part of the melee. It was one of my favourite
   tracks to record.
