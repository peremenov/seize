                           <h>John Walsh Walsh Glass

                 <h>Author: Eric Reynolds Editor: Angela Bowey

   <p>John Walsh Walsh was already well-known as a businessman in
   Birmingham, England when, in 1850, he bought an established glass
   factory in Lodge Road, Winson Green, Birmingham. He claimed that his
   strange name came about because the sponsors at his baptism were
   rather nervous and instead of saying just the Christian name John,
   said John Walsh, which made him John Walsh Walsh for the rest of his
   life! Church registers of the period, however, do not support his
   story.

   <p>From the outset he insisted on a very high standard of quality and
   design for the products he introduced. One of the first designs was an
   inkwell that was mounted on a mahogany plate and surrounded by an
   ornate decoration in brass sheeting. The inkwell (illustrated below)
   is clearly marked on the base with the date lozenge denoting the
   design registration date 18th April 1855.

   <p>John Walsh Walsh died in 1864 and his executors put the business up
   for sale. Fortunately it was bought by one of his daughters, Ellen
   Eliza, and her husband Thomas Ferdinand Walker, who was himself an
   active Birmingham entrepreneur. The company's future as a family firm
   was therefore secured. Thomas Walker passed the day-to-day
   administration over to a manager, Lewis John Murray, who for many
   years had been closely associated with glass manufacturing in
   Stourbridge.

   <p>The product ranges throughout the late Victorian period were vases and
   flower holders, lampshades, and all types of dining room table glass.
   Frequently the design of a flower holder was based on individual
   flowers including rose, tulip, crocus, honeysuckle and water-lily.
   Others took the form of novelty items such as palm trees, horse shoes
   and owls.

   <p>Lampshades in many different styles and colour were produced for oil,
   gas, electricity and candle lighting, with the use of moulded patterns
   being employed to great effect. The cut glass department concentrated
   on the production of fine intricate patterns for decanters, wine
   glasses and fruit bowls. Many of the designs were so attractive and
   decorative that many other companies attempted to produce imitations.
   John Walsh Walsh counteracted by filing registered designs at the
   Public Records Office to legally protect the business. Because many of
   the designs were fragile and delicate few of these items have survived
   to the present day, but those that have, reveal the standard and
   quality produced by the highly trained employees.

                       <p>These blue sateen silver-mounted salts are marked "R.D.86318" showing
                                    they
    were registered in 1887 by Martin Hall, electroplaters of Sheffield.
      In the Martin Hall pattern books these salts are shown with the
                  annotation "Blue Sateen Glass by Walsh".

   <p>Much of the credit for the early development of the Midlands glass
   industry is attributed to the Stourbridge companies, but there is
   evidence to show that John Walsh Walsh was particularly innovative in
   the process of manufacture in addition to the decoration of glass.


   <p>U.K. patents 5286 filed in 1883 and 13592 filed in 1885 by John Walsh
   Walsh clearly reveal how basic processes were being challenged. Here
   is an extract from patent 5286:
   "A hollow vessel of glass is blown in the usual manner, which vessel
   or cup may be of only one kind of glass, or may consist of two or more
   layers differing in respect of transparency or opacity, colour or
   absence of colour. On the outer or inner surface, or on the outer and
   inner surfaces, the desired pattern is produced by removing parts of
   the layer or layers by cutting, etching, engraving, sand-blasting or
   any other method. The decorated vessel is lined with glass and the
   whole worked up into the shape of the article to be made. In some
   instances a second cup of transparent glass may be used to encase the
   vessel to preserve the brilliancy of effect of the pattern." 
   <p>This Water-Lily Flower Holder has the registered design number 409769
                                   dated
       9 May 1903. This is a "single" but it appears in many forms of
                                  multiple
    configuration. See The Glass of John Walsh Walsh 1850-1951" page 14

   <p>And here is an extract from patent 13592:
   "Take a body of glass of any suitable colour or colours and coat this
   body with a layer of similar glass of another colour or colours, which
   is then painted with a design in a protecting resist. Then the piece
   is submitted to the action of acid to remove part of the overlaying
   layer and expose to view the under glass. The preserved part is then
   treated with gold, bronze or other effects and submitted to heat to
   burn in the applied effect. The unprotected part of the upper layer
   may also be removed by mechanical means such as engraving or
   sandblasting."

   <p>The early twentieth century was a period of consolidation for Walsh.
   The effect of the First World War limited the amount of development
   work, but a number of novelty flower holders in the form of a glass
   bridge, a hot-air balloon and an airship were made in limited
   quantities. A major introduction in 1912-1915 was a cut glass pattern
   named Koh-i-noor. This pattern being deeply cut was so unique that it
   remained a flagship of the company for many years, and was still in
   production at the time of closure in 1951.

   <p>Lewis John Murray died in 1912 and was succeeded as manager by R. H.
   Wood of the London Office. Overall control of the business, however,
   came under Philip Walker, a grandson of John Walsh Walsh, until his
   death in 1923. In the 1920's a range of bowls and vases in many shapes
   and sizes was developed around a delicate shade of yellow. The range
   was given the name of Primrose with subsequent additions extending to
   blue and green but produced in smaller quantities. A striking feature
   of the entire range was the white lining.

                 
   <p>The Kenilworth pattern was introduced in 1925 and gained in popularity
   as a more reasonably priced and easier-to-cut pattern than Koh-i-noor.
   The range was extended to include a variety of colours applied as
   casings before the cutting operation. The most popular colour was a
   rich blue, sold under the name Bristol Blue. Jade green was produced
   in smaller quantities, with ruby as the most limited of the range.


   <p>When R. H. Wood died in 1927, control passed to William Riley, who had
   married Catherine Walker the great grand-daughter of John Walsh Walsh.
   Riley was a qualified professional engineer and under his leadership
   the company developed into a highly profitable and progressive unit.

   <p>Koh-i-noor along with several other decorative patterns required the
   experience of highly skilled cutters. These cutting skills established
   Walsh as one of the leading glass manufacturers in the U.K. and a
   front-runner in the art and craft of fine cut glass.


   <p>Such were these skills that a major success was achieved in 1928 when
   the First Glass Convention was held in Bournemouth. For this occasion
   manufacturers were requested to design and manufacture a loving cup to
   be presented to the Mayor of the Corporation. The Royal Society of
   Arts selected the Walsh entry as the winner.

   <p>Walsh registered a number of trademarks, but with the exception of
   WALSH registered on 23 June 1926, very few appear to have been used.
   WALSH was later modified to WALSH, ENGLAND and appears on the majority
   of pieces produced between 1927 and 1951. A significant development
   during this period was the introduction of opalescent glass to produce
   screened lighting used extensively in public buildings. A series of
   panels representing The Twelve Labours of Hercules attracted special
   attention. The opalescent panels were very much in the style of
   Lalique, Sabino and Verlys. Walsh registered a U.K. trade mark VERLYS
   in 1934 on the same date that Holophane withdrew their application to
   register a similar mark. This suggests that there may have been some
   agreement between Walsh and Holophane.

   <p>Colour became an important feature of Walsh products and a new range
   of bubbly glass with the name of Pompeian was produced for the
   lower-price market. While much of the output was bowls and vases, a
   range of novelty items was also produced. Blue, green and amber were
   the most popular colours with a very limited number of items in
   amethyst and pink.

                  
   <p>Distinctive colours were selected for other ranges of bowls, vases and
   dishes, some of which were given an iridescent finish. The popular
   colours were amber and blue but a full range of harlequin colours were
   chosen for wine glasses and general tableware. An aggressive marketing
   approach was taken in respect of these latest ranges and a special
   promotional booklet, Colour in Glass, was produced.

   <p>The forward on the opening page of this booklet states:
   "Walsh Crystal is over a century old, and the appreciation of its good
   quality is universal but the public have not as yet had the
   opportunity of enjoying the beauty of their new creations in colour.
   Much time and thought is spent on interior decoration of the home, but
   it is the finishing touches that make or mar the whole effect. Walsh
   have, therefore, produced vases, lamps, table glass and candlesticks
   to conform with many different colour schemes. For just as the Persian
   carpet changes colour in different lights, so does the iridescent
   glass vary in shade and lustre."

   <p>William Clyne Farquharson who had joined the company in 1924 became
   Chief Designer in the early 1930's and developed his now highly
   collectible range of designs including named patterns Leaf, Kendal,
   Barry and Albany. Walsh glass including wine suites was frequently
   used on royal occasions inasmuch that one pattern was named after
   Marina the Duchess of Kent. A major reconstruction of the Lodge Road
   premises was carried out in 1934 with new furnaces added to increase
   production, and expensive control equipment added to further improve
   quality.

                              <p>The design of this vase by Clyne Farquharson is named "Leaf" and is
                                 one of the
     most popular of the designs he created for John Walsh Walsh. This
                         highly-collectable design
      is known to have been applied to bowls, decanters, wine glasses,
            powder bowls, and biscuit barrels as well as vases.

   <p>The outbreak of the Second World War, and the necessity for employees
   to serve with the armed forces, brought to an end the rising fortunes
   of the company. As was the case with many companies an increasing
   amount of capacity was directed towards the wartime effort by
   transferring resources to products required in the military, medical
   and scientific fields. Such were the skills and engineering knowledge
   of the management team at Walsh, supported by the experience of the
   employees that they were selected to manufacture prisms ground to
   extremely fine limits for use in episcopes. They also produced runway
   lighting at military airfields and lighting panels for aircraft and
   naval vessels to assist greater accuracy in navigation.

   <p>Following the war an attempt was made to re-establish the main product
   lines but largely because of the labour controls introduced by the
   Government the pre-war skills were not widely available. Several new
   ventures were considered in order to reinstate the company to its
   earlier forward-thinking, imaginative, and innovative role. But the
   inability to restore the former worldwide reputation of the company
   gradually had an effect on performance, and a decision was taken in
   1949 to close the cut glass department followed by another decision in
   1951 to close the entire business. It is ironic that the commitment to
   a high quality glass product led to the eventual closure of the
   factory.

   <p>The history of John Walsh Walsh is an insight into a company whose
   products reflected the skills and personalities of both management and
   employees. Walsh decorative glass and tableware developed over many
   years from the experience and expertise of previous generations with
   the Walsh legacy being that of an enlightened firm which produced
   glass of a fine pedigree. Because of the lack of documentary evidence
   and records, little has been known hitherto about this company.
   However, the Walsh factory will always enjoy a secure and respected
   place in the history of glass manufacture.

                       <p>This delicate little glass crown is 6" tall and was made in 1897 to
     commemorate Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. It is marked with the
        registration number 295654, and is so fragile that this very
           rare example has lost two of the four supporting arms.

     <p>Eric Reynolds has written a definitive book about the superb glass
    produced by the John Walsh Walsh company, published in January 2000.
