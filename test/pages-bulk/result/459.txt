  <h>Operation Enduring Freedom - Afghanistan
<p> At approximately 0845 hours Eastern Daylight Time on
   Tuesday, 11 September 2001, a commercial airplane crashed into the
   north tower of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. At
   that time, the severity of the incident, the numbers of people
   involved, and the reason for the crash were all unknown. Shortly after
   0900 hours, a second plane hit the south tower of the World Trade
   Center.

   <p> Around 1000 hours, reports came in that another commercial plane hit
   the Pentagon, in Washington, DC, and a fourth commercial plane was
   downed in Somerset County, PA, about 80 miles southeast of Pittsburgh.
   Shortly after 1000 hours the south tower of the World Center
   collapsed. Within the next half-hour, the northern tower of the World
   Trade Center also collapsed. At approximately 1730 hours a third tower
   in the World Trade Center complex, Building #7, also collapsed.
   Wednesday evening, September 12, another building within the World
   Trade Center Complex collapsed.

   <p> After the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and
   the Pentagon, the United States military entered into a war against
   global terrorism. The President began the U.S. response in the War on
   Terrorism with the stroke of his pen to seize terrorists' financial
   assets and disrupt their fundraising network. Unlike most previous
   conflicts, this war is being fought on both domestic and foreign soil.
   Deployment of American troops to Southwest Asia and countries
   surrounding Afghanistan in the days following the attacks.

   <p> The military response to the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on
   the United States was assigned the name Operation Enduring Freedom,
   but was previously planned to have been called Operation Infinite
   Justice (this name is believed to have been changed following concerns
   that this might offend the Muslim community as Islam teaches that
   Allah is the only one who can provide Infinite Justice).

   <p> OEF commenced on Oct. 7, 2001. Early combat operations included a mix
   of air strikes from land-based B-1, B-2 and B-52 bombers;
   carrier-based F-14 and F/A-18 fighters; and Tomahawk cruise missiles
   launched from both U.S. and British ships and submarines.

   <p> The initial military objectives of Operation Enduring Freedom, as
   articulated by President George W. Bush in his Sept. 20th Address to a
   Joint Session of Congress and his Oct. 7th address to country, include
   the destruction of terrorist training camps and infrastructure within
   Afghanistan, the capture of al Qaeda leaders, and the cessation of
   terrorist activities in Afghanistan.

   <p> Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld stated in an Oct. 7th DoD News
   Briefing that US objectives were to make clear to Taliban leaders that
   the harboring of terrorists is unacceptable, to acquire intelligence
   on al Qaeda and Taliban resources, to develop relations with groups
   opposed to the Taliban, to prevent the use of Afghanistan as a safe
   haven for terrorists, and to destroy the Taliban military allowing
   opposition forces to succeed in their struggle. Finally, military
   force would help facilitate the delivering of humanitarian supplies to
   the Afghan people.

   <p> The British had also defined the goals of their involvement (termed
   Operation Veritas) in "Her Majesty's Government's Campaign
   Objectives," dated Oct. 16th. The short term goals of the military
   action included the capture of Osama bin Laden and other al Qaeda
   leaders, the prevention of further attacks by al Qaeda, the end of
   Afghanistan's harboring of terrorists, their training camps and
   infrastructure, and the removal of Mullah Omar and the Taliban Regime.
   Long term goals include the end of terrorism, the deterrence of state
   sponsorship of terrorism, and the reintigration of Afghanistan into
   the international community.

<h>Planning and Implementing

   <p> On 11 September 2001, General Tommy Franks was enroute to Pakistan to
   meet with President Musharraf to discuss a number of issues, among
   them security cooperation and terrorism. The events of that day caused
   him to return immediately to Tampa, Florida, where his staff was
   already working along with Defense and other government agencies to
   ensure what is referred to in the military as "command and control
   survivability" while continuing to develop "situational awareness."

   <p> On 12 September the Secretary of Defense directed the preparation of
   "credible military options" to respond to international terrorism. For
   Central Command, that directive guided the preparation of the plan
   that unfolded in Afghanistan. The concept, which Franks briefed to the
   President on 21 September, proposed that "US Central Command, as a
   part of America's Global War on Terrorism . . . would destroy the Al
   Qaida network inside Afghanistan along with the illegitimate Taliban
   regime which was harboring and protecting the terrorists."

   <p> Planning involved not only an evaluation of the enemy situation, but
   also the history of military operations in Afghanistan and the
   political and military situation across the region. This "mission
   analysis" resulted in Franks' recommendation of a military course of
   action which was approved by Secretary Rumsfeld on 1 October. Franks
   briefed the concept to President Bush on 2 October, and Bush directed
   that combat operations should begin on 7 October -- 26 days after the
   attacks on New York and the Pentagon.

   <p> Operations would involve the full weight of America's national power,
   and would include significant contributions from the international
   community. By 2002 the coalition had grown to more than 68 nations,
   with 27 nations having representatives at CENTCOM headquarters.

   <p> With the cooperation and support of this coalition and the integration
   of virtually every agency of the US government, CENTCOM had executed
   multiple "Lines of Operation," attacking simultaneously on several
   fronts. The intention from the outset was to seize the initiative and
   reinforce success, while keeping in mind the lessons of previous
   campaigns in Afghanistan -- avoid "invading," and work with (rather
   than against) the people. A critical enabler of the strategy was the
   coordination of basing, staging, and over-flight rights. This
   political-military coordination set (and maintained) the conditions
   necessary to execute and support sustained combat.

   <p> Among the lines of operation which characterized the campaign had been
   "Direct Attack of the Leadership of Al Qaida and the Taliban," and the
   provision of "Humanitarian Aid" to the Afghan people. Another line had
   focused on "Destroying the Taliban Military," using unconventional
   warfare forces alongside Afghan opposition groups whose goals were
   consistent with US interests. And, "Operational Fires" directed by
   horse-mounted Special Forces troopers have also proven to be unique
   and successful.

   <p> Additionally, CENTCOM had employed Special Operations Forces in
   "Reconnaissance and Direct Action" roles while maintaining the
   capability to introduce "Operational Maneuver" (conventional forces)
   if required.

   <p> The success of these lines of operation, which have been applied
   simultaneously rather than sequentially, is a matter of record. On 7
   October, the Taliban controlled more than 80% of Afghanistan, and
   Anti-Taliban forces were on the defensive. Al Qaida was entrenched in
   camps and safe houses throughout the country. Afghanistan was, in
   fact, a terrorist sponsored state.

   <p> By October 20, 2001 US and Coalition forces had destroyed virtually
   all Taliban air defenses and had conducted a highly successful direct
   action mission on the residence of Mullah Omar in the middle of the
   Taliban capital, Qandahar. During this time frame Special Forces
   detachments linked up with Anti-Taliban leaders and coordinated
   operational fires and logistics support on multiple fronts. Twenty
   days later, the provincial capital of Mazar-e Sharif fell. In rapid
   succession, Herat, Kabul, and Jalalabad followed. By mid- December, US
   Marines had secured Qandahar Airport and the Taliban capital was in
   the hands of Anti-Taliban forces. Within weeks the Taliban and Al
   Qaida were reduced to isolated pockets of fighters. On 22 December
   Franks traveled to Kabul to attend a ceremony marking the inauguration
   of the Afghan interim government -- 78 days after the beginning of
   combat operations.

   <p> By mid-March 2002, the Taliban had been removed from power and the Al
   Qaida network in Afghanistan had been destroyed. The US continued to
   exploit detainees and sensitive sites for their intelligence value in
   order to prevent future terrorist attacks and to further US
   understanding of Al Qaida -- their plans, membership, structure, and
   intentions. The US was investigating each site to confirm or deny the
   existence of research into, or production of, chemical, biological, or
   radiological weapons. Coalition forces continued to locate and destroy
   remaining pockets of Taliban and Al Qaida fighters and to search for
   surviving leadership.

   <p> In the 169 days since 11 September, US and Coalition forces had
   amassed a remarkable record of achievements. Following are but a few
   examples.
     <l>* All positioning and most of the resupply of forces in the theater
       has been accomplished by air as a result of a remarkable effort by
       US Transportation Command.
     <l>* In addition to providing the firepower and "staying power" of two
       carrier battlegroups, the Navy steamed USS KITTY HAWK 7,000 miles
       at flank speed to establish an afloat, forward operating base for
       Special Operations Forces.
     <l>* In terms of operational fires, Navy, Marine, and Air Force pilots
       have delivered in excess of 18,000 munitions, of which more than
       10,000 were precision guided.
     <l>* During DESERT STORM the US averaged 10 aircraft per target; in
       ENDURING FREEDOM the US has averaged 2 targets per aircraft.
     <l>* US airmen have flown the longest combat fighter mission in US
       history (more than 15 hours), and conducted the longest
       surveillance mission (26 hours).
     <l>* The extensive use of unmanned aerial vehicles has permitted
       around- the-clock surveillance of critical sites, facilities, and
       troop concentrations.
     <l>* US psychological warfare operators had delivered more than 50
       million leaflets, and transport crews had delivered 2.5 million
       humanitarian daily rations, 1,700 tons of wheat, and 328,200
       blankets. More than 5,000 radios had been provided to the Afghan
       people, and the US broadcast capabilities continued to bring music
       to people for the first time in more than six years.
     <l>* The US had also made enormous improvements in its ability to bring
       firepower to bear rapidly. Through improved technology and
       training, the Tomahawk targeting cycle had been reduced from 101
       minutes during ALLIED FORCE to 19 minutes during ENDURING FREEDOM,
       with half of the Tomahawks having been fired from submarines.

<h>Lessons Learned

   <p> By mid-March 2002, CENTCOM was in the preliminary stages of capturing
   the lessons of this campaign. It is too early to draw final
   conclusions because the fight continues, but CENTCOM did have some
   emerging insights.
     <l>* Combining the resources and capabilities of the Defense
       Department, Central Intelligence Agency, and other agencies of the
       Federal government has produced results no single entity could
       have achieved. Similarly, adopting flexible coalition arrangements
       has enabled the US to leverage the strengths of individual
       nations. "The mission has determined the coalition; the coalition
       has not determined the mission."
     <l>* This operation continues to be commanded and controlled from
       Tampa, Florida with fielded technology providing real-time
       connectivity to air, ground, naval, and Special Operations Forces
       operating 7000 miles away. CENTCOM forces were deployed from 267
       bases; are operating from 30 locations in 15 nations; and
       currently over-fly 46 nations in the course of operations. Yet,
       the ability to "see" the battlefield literally and figuratively at
       each location provides unprecedented situational awareness.
     <l>* Security cooperation, diplomacy, and military-to-military contacts
       have built relationships that have proven invaluable during the
       campaign. Humanitarian airdrops; economic and security assistance
       to coalition partners and regional allies; visits to the region by
       senior Administration, Congressional, and military officials; and
       a US commitment to post-conflict reconstruction of Afghanistan
       have permitted the US to build upon these essential relationships.
       The investment in security cooperation has been repaid tenfold in
       access to basing, staging, and over-flight rights with regional
       partners.
     <l>* Precision guided munitions are more than a force multiplier. They
       have reduced the numbers of air sorties required to destroy
       targets and have resulted in unprecedented low levels of
       collateral damage. From this perspective, use of precision guided
       munitions has produced a positive strategic effect.
     <l>* As has been said in the past, the availability of strategic
       airlift is critical to the success of operations that require
       force projection. The current airlift fleet requires strict
       management and innovative scheduling and the experience in
       ENDURING FREEDOM would seem to validate the testimony the
       committee received last year -- that the US must expand its
       strategic lift capabilities.
     <l>* The importance of combined and joint operations training and
       readiness has been revalidated. The power of a well-trained air-
       ground team has permitted the combination of 19th Century Cavalry
       and 21st Century precision guided munitions into an effective
       fighting force.
     <l>* A continuous, unimpeded flow of intelligence remains key to
       success on the battlefield. Human intelligence is essential when
       mission objectives include locating, identifying, and capturing or
       killing mobile targets. This requires people on the ground.
       Similarly, unmanned aerial vehicles have proven their worth in the
       skies over Afghanistan.
     <l>* Information Operations also have been vital to the success of
       ENDURING FREEDOM. Psychological operations, electronic warfare,
       and a number of special capabilities have proven their value and
       potential. Continued development of these capabilities is
       essential.
