                         <h>Frequently Asked Questions
                                  Hungary
   
   <h>WORK PROJECTS

   
   <h>What are the main work projects?
   <p> Teaching conversational English to elementary, high school, and adult
   students is the service project in Hódmezõvásárhely, (pronounced
   HOD-mezer-vah-shar-hey or just VAH-shar-hey) in southern Hungary. All
   volunteers teach under the direction of Hungarian teachers. You will
   assist in the day's classroom work using student texts and established
   lesson plans provided by the teacher. You will also have opportunities
   to depart from the formal lessons. For example, you can serve as a
   resource on topics of North American culture, including discussions on
   history, daily lifestyle, sports, and school systems. American songs,
   games, dialogues, letter writing, plays, flash cards, and discussions
   are the primary techniques used depending on the ages and proficiency
   of the students.

   <p> What is the normal daily schedule?
   <l>7:00 AM Breakfast & morning meeting
   <l>8:00 AM Depart hotel for school
   <l>8:30 AM Begin teaching (there are short breaks between classes)
   <l>1:00 PM Return to hotel
   <l>1:30 PM Lunch
   <l>2:30 PM Class preparation (some adult classes are taught in the
   afternoon)
   <l>5:00 PM Free time.
   <l>7:00 PM Dinner and evening conversation
   <l>8:00 PM Free time

   <h>How can you be sure you are really making a difference?
   <p> English has become the international language of commerce and
   technology. Children and adults all over the world want to learn
   English as a tool for their future development. That is why the mayor,
   teachers and school administrators in the Hódmezõvásárhely invited
   Global Volunteers to send volunteers to teach conversational English
   in 2003. The Hungarian English teachers are very good English
   grammarians and they are excellent teachers. However, English is their
   second, third or perhaps fourth language. Students want and need to
   learn pronunciation, idioms, and syntax from native English speakers.
   With that said, it is apparent that sharing English conversation with
   a native speaker for only one or two weeks will not greatly enhance a
   student's ability to speak English. However, working with several
   native English speakers for many weeks each year - year after year -
   can have a tremendous positive effect. We know this is the case
   because the teachers with whom we have worked in communities all over
   the world continue to invite us back and enthusiastic students keep
   showing up for class, month after month, year after year. You can
   truly make an enormous difference in the lives of Hungarian students
   by teaching conversational English, even for just a week or two!

   <h>What types of people volunteer in country?
   <p> This is one of Global Volunteers newest programs; however, based upon
   our experience in other Eastern European countries, people from all
   walks of life and throughout the U.S. will volunteer in Hungary. A
   majority will be women, most will be college graduates, and about half
   will be retirees.

   <h>How many volunteers are on each team?
   <p> Most Global Volunteers teams include between 8 and 15 volunteers plus
   the team leader.

                               <h>GETTING THERE
   <h>Which airport should I book my flight into?
   <p> Please schedule your arrival for Ferihegy Airport in Budapest, Hungary

   <h>When should I arrive in Budapest?

   <p> Please arrive at Ferihegy Airport In Budapest no later than 3:30 PM on
   the first day of the service program. If you plan your arrival for
   after 3:30 PM, you will be responsible for your own transportation to
   the Hotel Fáma in Hódmezõvásárhely, our host community. Bear in mind,
   however, that Hódmezõvásárhely is a three-hour drive from Budapest and
   that the only way to get there on your own might be by a combination
   of train and bus, which would involve at least two transfers. Should
   you be unable to purchase a ticket for the first day of the service
   program, please make arrangements to arrive prior to, not after, that
   date. Global Volunteers requires that all volunteers arrive by the
   scheduled start date of the service program.

   <h>Will someone meet me at the airport?
   <p> Provided you send your flight itinerary to Global Volunteers at least
   two weeks in advance of the service program start date and arrive
   during the designated arrival window, your team leader will be at
   Ferihegy Airport to meet you and your fellow team members from 12:00
   PM to 3:30 PM. If you arrive before 12:00 PM, you can wait for your
   team leader in the arrivals area of Terminal 2B.

   <h>What should I do if my flight is delayed?
   <p> If your flight is delayed or you miss a connection, please notify
   Global Volunteers at 612-850-4750 as soon as possible of your new
   arrival plans so that we can inform your team leader. You can call
   either 800-487-1074 or 651-407-6100 during normal business hours (8 AM
   to 5 PM Monday through Friday, US central time), or call 612-850-4750
   evenings, weekends and holidays. You can leave a voice mail message on
   any of these numbers if no one answers. However, if it is a weekend or
   U.S. holiday you must leave the message on 612-850-4750. If you must
   leave a message, it is important that you also contact the hotel where
   you are scheduled to stay and leave a message for the Global
   Volunteers' team leader.

   <h>How can I get from the airport to the hotel on my own?
   <p> Volunteers will be lodged at the Hotel Fáma in our host community of
   Hódmezõvásárhely, which is about a three-hour drive from Budapest to
   the southeast. Getting to Hódmezõvásárhely on your own would likely
   prove challenging, but were you to do so, one option would be the take
   a taxi from Ferihegy Airport to Nyugati Train Station in central
   Budapest. Then take a train from Nyugati Station to the southern
   Hungarian city of Szeged. From the Szeged train station, you could
   either take a second train to Hódmezõvásárhely or catch a bus (buses
   are yellow and are run by a company called Hódmezõ), which would take
   you to a number of stops in downtown Hódmezõvásárhely
   (Hódmezõvásárhely is about 30 minutes from Szeged). It might also be
   possible to forego all of the above and hire a private car to take you
   the entire way from Ferihegy Airport to Hódmezõvásárhely, but such a
   service would be very expensive.

   <h>If I am delayed, how late can I arrive at the Hotel Fama in
   Hódmezõvásárhely? 

   <p> Our orientation sessions are a critical component of the preparation
   for your teaching assignments. If circumstances beyond your control
   prevent you from reaching the program on the opening Saturday of the
   program (the program's first day), then we require that you arrive no
   later than 9:00 AM on the first Sunday.

   <h>What should I do if I arrive prior to the scheduled arrival date?
   <p> If you plan your arrival in Hungary before the designated program
   start date and choose not to meet the team leader at the airport, you
   will be responsible for your own transportation to the hotel.

   <h>Will Global Volunteers make a reservation for me at the hotel if I
   arrive early?
   <p> If you are arriving early and choose to stay at the Hotel Fáma, please
   contact the hotel to make reservations for your early arrival days. If
   you want to stay somewhere else, we recommend that you check the
   numerous guidebooks available on Hungary to find a hotel that fits
   your needs.

   <h>If I plan to arrive where can I stay?
   <p> Global Volunteers teams serving in Hódmezõvásárhely stay at the Hotel
   Fáma for the duration of the program. The hotel staff will be happy to
   reserve a room for you if you arrive prior to, or after the program
   dates.

   <p> When making your reservation, identify yourself as a member of a
    Global Volunteers team. The cost of a single room costs between US$30
   to US$45, and the cost of a double room usually runs from US$40 to
   US$55.

   <h>At what time and on what date can I depart Hungary?
   <p> Please plan your departure for 12:00 PM or later on the final day of
   the service program. Your team leader will accompany you to the
   airport to assist you with check-in. If you plan your departure for
   earlier than 12:00 PM on the last day, you will be responsible for
   your own transportation back to Budapest (a three-hour trip by private
   car). Similarly, if you choose to depart by rail or other means, you
   will be responsible for your own transportation.

  
                              <h>FOOD AND LODGING

  
   <h>What are the sleeping accommodations?
   <p> Volunteers stay at the Hotel Fáma, a charming tourist-class Hungarian
   hotel. The rooms are double occupancy, although single rooms are
   available for an additional fee. The Hotel Fáma is centrally located
   and within walking distance of a pharmacy, bank, grocery store,
   internet cafe, and most of the schools where we teach.

   <h>Are single rooms available?

   <p> Single rooms are available for an additional fee. To secure a single
   room, you must pay Global Volunteers the single supplement charge no
   later than 30 days prior to the start of the service program. Singles
   are sometimes limited and thus are available on a first come basis.
   When available, the cost of a single supplement is USD $315 for one
   week, USD $420 for two weeks and USD $630 for three weeks.

   <p> (Hotel prices are subject to change. Please confirm with a volunteer
   coordinator that these prices are still available) 

   <h>What are the bathroom facilities?
   <p> Each room has a private bathroom with shower.

   <h>What are the laundry arrangements?
   <p> The hotel has a laundry service.

   <h>What about electricity?
   <p> The current in Hungary is 220V. You should bring a converter (to 220V)
   and an adapter (the large round double-pronged version used throughout
   Europe) for your electrical appliances unless they are dual voltage.

   <h>If I am arriving early, where do I stay?
   <p> If you arrive in Hungary prior to the start date of the service
   program, you may choose to stay at Hotel Fama.

   <h>What is the local cuisine?
   <p> The food is absolutely delightful. Hungarians are well known for their
   delicious soups and Hungarian goulash. In addition, their fish, meats
   (particularly beef and veal), vegetables, and deserts are also
   wonderful. A typical main meal will have bread, a salad, soup, an
   entrée, and then dessert or fruit.

   <h>Where do we eat?
   <p> Breakfast is eaten at the hotel, lunch is either at the school or
   restaurant, and dinner is at a restaurant.

   <h>Can special diets be accommodated?
   <p> Avoiding meat is not a major problem. However, strict vegetarians or
   vegans may be difficult to accommodate. Volunteers with such strict
   requirements will eat mostly bread, and vegetables. Consider bringing
   familiar foods to supplement your diet if you have especially
   restrictive special needs.

   <h>Will potable drinking water be provided?
   <p> We do not recommend drinking the tap water. Bottled water is readily
   available.

                                <h>HEALTH TIPS
   <h>What health precautions should I take?
   <p> We strongly recommend that you visit with your personal physician,
   public health care provider or international travel clinic to
   determine what immunizations, vaccinations and other precautions you
   should take to prepare for your trip. In addition to your local

   the days of the service program through AIG ASSIST up to a maximum of
   $50,000 USD. If you want to be covered either before or after the

   costs of evacuation. You'll need other insurance to cover the costs of
   medical services.


   <h>What is AIG ASSIST?
   <p> An information sheet on AIG will be provided with your orientation
   materials.


   <h>Does Global Volunteers provide or recommend travel insurance?

                                  <h>CLIMATE


   <h>What is the weather like?
   <p> The temperatures in southern Hungary range from very warm in the
   summer months to cold and blustery in the winter. Weather in the early
   spring and the late fall can be quite variable. For example, in March
   and November it is not unknown to have some days approach 65 degrees
   while other days the temperature hovers around freezing. If you are
   traveling between February and early April or between late October and
   early December, we recommend that you bring clothes for all weather
   conditions.

   <h>What are the seasons?
   <p> January and February are the coldest months; June through September
   are the warmest months.

   <p> The local currency is the forint.

   <h>What is the current exchange rate?

   <h>Where do I exchange money?
   <p> You can exchange money at the airport upon your arrival in Budapest or
   at local banks in Hódmezõvásárhely.

   <h>Can I use cash, credit cards or checks?
   
   <p> Credit Cards.

   <p> A debit card can be used to get cash 24 hours a day. There are several
   outside ATM machines in Hódmezõvásárhely. Credit cards are not
   accepted at some stores in Hódmezõvásárhely.

   <p> Traveler's Checks:

   <p> While traveler's checks are still a safe method of safeguarding cash
   when traveling, they are not the most convenient. The banks in this
   area of Hungary are not as accustomed to American tourists. As a
   result, the process for changing traveler's checks can take some time.

   <p> Cash:

   <p> If you are bringing cash, please note that torn, worn, or defaced
   bills may not be accepted. Torn traveler's checks might also not be
   accepted.

   <h>How much money should I bring with me?
   <p> How much you bring depends on your personal spending and shopping
   habits and whether or not you want to go on an excursion during free
   time on the weekend. Weekend trips can cost between $200 - $300,
   depending on where you go, and the transportation and accommodations
   used. Your souvenir budget is discretionary. Most shops are open for
   business during the morning hours and then are closed in the afternoon
   from 1:00 PM - 3:00 or 5:00 PM. Stores then re-open in the evening
   around 7:00 PM.

                               <h>COMMUNICATIONS

   <h>How can my family contact me while I am in Hungary?

   our hosts in Hódmezõvásárhely, and Global Volunteers business and
   after hours phones. Be sure to leave a copy with them.

   <h>What about international phone calls?
   <p> There will be phones and faxes locally available for you to use for
   international communication. However, using locally purchased phone
   cards is usually cheaper than calling directly through the hotel.

   <h>Can I make phone calls from my room?

   <p> The rooms at the Hotel Fáma have a telephone. You are responsible for
   any charges for calls made from your room.

   <h>Is internet service available?
