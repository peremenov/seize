   <h>WORK PROJECTS
   

   
   <h>What are the principal service projects?
   <p>Teaching conversational English is the service project in southern
   Italy. In the spring and fall, volunteers are needed to teach
   conversational English to elementary, middle school, or high school
   students under the direction of Italian English teachers in Manduria,
   Monopoli, Brindisi and communities surrounding Ostuni. You will assist
   in each day's classroom work using student texts and established
   lesson plans provided by the teacher. You'll also have opportunities
   to depart from the formal lessons. For example, you can serve as a
   resource on topics of North American culture, including discussions on
   history, daily lifestyle, sports, and school systems. Some volunteers
   also teach American songs and games, while others provide instruction
   on continuing dialogues and writing letters.

   <p>In the summer, volunteers are also needed to teach conversational
   English in Ostuni, but you will conduct your lessons much more
   independently. These are intensive English language programs for
   children eight to 14 years old. Instead of teaching hand in hand with
   a local teacher, you and your teammates will work under the guidance
   of a single local coordinator who will want you to oversee your own
   lessons.


   <h>What is the normal daily schedule?
   <l>7:00 AM Breakfast & team meeting
    <l>8:30 AM
   Depart hotel for school
    <l>9:00 AM Begin teaching (there are short breaks between classes)
    <l>1:00 PM Return to hotel
    <l>1:30 PM Lunch
    <l>2:30 PM Class preparation
    <l>4:00 PM One-on-one lessons with adults (only once or twice a week) ;
   if not, free time.
    <l>7:00 PM Dinner and evening conversation
    <l>8:00 PM Free time



   <h>How can you be sure you are really making a difference?

   <p>English has become the international language of commerce and
   technology. Children and adults all over the world want to learn
   English as a tool for their future development. That is why the
   teachers and school administrators in the Pulgia region of Italy
   invited Global Volunteers to send volunteers to teach conversational
   English in 1995. The Italian English teachers are very good English
   grammarians and they are excellent teachers. However, English is their
   second, third or perhaps fourth language. Students want and need to
   learn pronunciation, idioms and syntax from native English speakers.
   With that said, it is apparent that sharing English conversation with
   a native speaker for only one or two weeks will not greatly enhance a
   student's ability to speak English. However, working with several
   native English speakers for many weeks each year - year after year -
   can have a tremendous positive effect. We know this is the case
   because the teachers keep inviting us back and enthusiastic students
   keep showing up for class, month after month, year after year. You can
   truly make an enormous difference in the lives of Italian students by
   teaching conversational English, even for just a week or two!



   <h>What types of people volunteer in Italy?

   <p>People from all walks of life and from countries all over the globe
   volunteer in Italy. However, the vast majority are from the U.S. 67%
   are women and 33% men. Most are college graduates. 10% are under 30
   and 80% are 50 or older.



   <h>How many volunteers are on each team?

   <p>Most teams include between 8 and 15 volunteers plus the team leader.



                     

               <h>If you don't find an answer to your question,
                         please call 800-487-1074.
                                      
   <h>GETTING THERE
   


   <h>Which airport should I book my flight into?
   <p>Please schedule your arrival at the airport in Brindisi, Italy
   (airport code BDS).



   <h>When should I arrive in Brindisi?

   <p>Please book your arrival at Brindisi airport no later than 6:30 PM on
   the service program arrival date. If you cannot arrive by 6:30 PM, you
   can either arrive a day or two early and stay at your own cost in
   Brindisi or the community where you will be serving, or arrive later
   that evening and make your own way to the hotel. However, if you
   arrive later, you may miss the initial orientation session scheduled
   for the first evening.

   <p>You can also take the train from Rome. If you plan to arrive by train,
   you can go to Brindisi and meet the rest of the team at the airport.
   Or, if you are scheduled to go Ostuni, you can go straight to the
   Incanto Hotel without stopping in Brindisi. All trains coming from the
   north will stop in Ostuni before going on to Brindisi. You should get
   off the train in Ostuni (the station is on the outskirts of town) and
   take a taxi to the hotel. The cost of a taxi is approximately USD8 -
   10.


   <h>Will someone meet me at the airport?

   <p>If you send your flight itinerary to Global Volunteers at least two
   weeks in advance of the service program arrival date, your team leader
   will meet you up at the designated airport during two periods of the
   day. The first pick up will correspond with the early afternoon flight
   from Rome, which arrives at approximately 2:00pm. The second pick up
   will correspond with the early evening flight from Rome, which is at
   approximately 6:15pm. Your team leader will meet you just outside the
   baggage claim area and will be displaying a Global Volunteers sign.



   <h>What should I do if my flight is delayed?
   <p>If your flight is delayed or you miss a connection, please notify
   Global Volunteers at 612-850-4750 as soon as possible of your new
   arrival plans so that we can inform your team leader. You can call
   either 800-487-1074 or 651-407-6100 during normal business hours (8 AM
   to 5 PM Monday through Friday, US central time), or call 612-850-4750
   evenings, weekends and holidays. You can leave a voice mail message on
   any of these numbers if no one answers. However, if it is a weekend or
   US holiday you must leave the message on 612-850-4750. If you must
   leave a message, it is important that you also contact the hotel where
   you are scheduled to stay and leave a message for the Global
   Volunteers' team leader.



   <h>If I am delayed, what is the absolute latest time I can arrive at the
   hotel?
   <p>Our orientation sessions are a critical component of the preparation
   for your assignments. If circumstances beyond your control prevent you
   from reaching the program on the opening day of the program, then we
   ask that you arrive no later than 9:00 AM on the following day.


   <h>How can I get from the airport to the hotel?

   <p>Teams serving Ostuni or surrounding communities will be lodged at the
   Incanto Hotel in Ostuni proper. The Incanto is about a 30-minute drive
   from the Brindisi airport, with most of the route being north along
   the main coastal drive. Curbside taxis from Brindisi to the Incanto
   Hotel cost about USD60.

   <p>Teams serving in Monopoli will be lodged at the Clio Hotel in downtown
   Monopoli.


   <h>If I am delayed, what is the absolute latest I can arrive at the hotel
   in Ostuni or Manduria?
   <p>Our orientation sessions are a critical component of the preparation
   for your teaching assignments. If circumstances beyond your control
   prevent you from reaching the program on the opening Saturday of the
   program (the program's first day), then we require that you arrive no
   later than 9:00 AM on the first Sunday.



   <h>What should I do if I arrive prior to the scheduled arrival date?
   <p>If you plan your arrival in Italy before the designated program start
   date and choose not to meet the team leader at the airport, you will
   be responsible for your own transportation to the hotel. Curbside
   taxis from the airport in Brindisi to the hotels in Ostuni and
   Manduria typically cost USD60 and USD75.



   <h>If I am arriving early, where can I stay?
   <p>Global Volunteers teams serving in Ostuni or its surrounding
   communities stay at the Incanto Hotel for the duration of the program.
   The hotel staff will be happy to reserve a room for you if you arrive
   prior to, or after the program dates.

   <h>FOOD AND LODGING



   <h>What are the sleeping accommodations?

     <h>For Ostuni-based programs: 

   <p>Volunteers stay at the Incanto, which is an elegant and charming
   Italian hotel. The rooms are double occupancy, although single rooms
   are available for an additional fee. Volunteers are placed in double
   rooms unless the composition of the team requires a single or unless a
   supplemental fee is paid to Global Volunteers. Please note that
   energy-saving laws in Puglia prohibit hotels from turning on their
   heating systems until mid-November, so if you're traveling during the
   late fall, you may want to bring warm sleeping attire. The Incanto is
   located two miles from the old town square and the more modern
   downtown, where a pharmacy, bank, grocery store and other shops are
   available. Transportation is by taxi or local bus.

   <h>For Monopoli-based programs:

   <p>Volunteers stay at the Hotel Clio, a large tourist-class hotel
   overlooking the Adriatic. Volunteers are placed in double rooms unless
   the composition of the team requires a single or unless a supplemental
   fee is paid to Global Volunteers. All rooms have access to a TV
   sitting room centrally located for general use. Please keep in mind
   that energy-saving laws in Puglia prohibit hotels from turning on
   their heating systems until mid-November, so if you're traveling
   during the late fall, you may want to bring warm sleeping attire. The
   hotel is a short five-block walk from the town square and central
   business district.



   <h<Are single rooms available?

   <p>For Ostuni-based programs: Single rooms are available for an
   additional fee. To secure a single room, you must pay Global
   Volunteers the single supplement charge no later than 30 days prior to
   the start of the service program. Singles are sometimes limited and
   thus are available on a first come basis. When available, the cost of
   a single supplement is USD $336 for one week and USD $448 for two
   weeks.

   <p>For Monopoli-based programs: Single rooms are available for an
   additional fee. To secure a single room, you must pay Global
   Volunteers the single supplement charge no later than 30 days prior to
   the start of the service program. Singles are sometimes limited and
   thus are available on a first come basis. When available, the cost of
   a single supplement is USD $345 for one week and USD $465 for two
   weeks.

   <p>(Hotel prices are subject to change. Please confirm with a volunteer
   coordinator that these prices are still available)
   


   <h>What are the bathroom facilities?
   <p>Each room has a private bathroom with shower. As taking baths is more
   common than showering in this part of Europe, many shower stalls are
   fitted with only very thin curtains, thus allowing water to get on the
   bathroom floor. Because most of the bathrooms have faux-marble floor
   tiles that can get slippery when wet, we recommend that you bring
   rubber shower slippers for extra safety.


   <h>What are the laundry arrangements?
   <p>Neither of the hotels offers complementary laundry service, but there
   are laundry mats in town and often the hotel can deliver the clothes
   for you. It costs approximately USD4 - 5 to launder a shirt on your
   own; if you ask the hotel to assist you, the cost can range as high as
   USD8. We recommend you ask the price in advance, as prices vary by the
   garment.


   <h>What about electricity?
   <p>The current in Italy is 220V. You should bring a converter (to 220V)
   and an adapter (the large round double-pronged version used throughout
   Europe) for your electrical appliances unless they are dual voltage.


   <h>If I am arriving early, where do I stay?
   <p>(If you arrive in Italy prior to the start date of the service
   program, you may choose to stay at one of the hotels that Global
   Volunteers uses (the hotel will depend on the location of your
   program). Following is the contact information:

     Tel: 011-39-8080-2711
     Fax: 011-39-8093-06-451


   <h>What is the local cuisine?

   <p>The food in this part of Italy is wonderful. The breakfast is light --
   fruit, cereal, rolls, cheese, yogurt, juice and tea or coffee. Lunch
   and dinner consists mostly of antipasti, pasta, seafood, various meats
   (particularly beef, chicken and veal), vegetables, and soups. A
   typical meal will have bread, a salad or soup, two small main courses,
   and then dessert or fruit.


   <h>Where do we eat?
   <p>Each of the three hotels has a large dining room where we eat both
   breakfast and dinner. We have lunch at local restaurants.



   <h>Can special diets be accommodated?
   <p>Avoiding meat is not a problem. Strict vegetarians or vegans are more
   difficult to accommodate, although it is certainly possible.
   Volunteers with such strict requirements will eat mostly pasta, bread,
   and vegetables, although egg and butter are used in many such recipes.
   Consider bringing familiar foods to supplement your diet if you have
   especially restrictive needs.



   <h>Will potable drinking water be provided?
   
   <p>The tap water in southern Italy is generally safe, although bottled
   water is readily available.

   <h>HEALTH TIPS



   <h>What health precautions should I take?
   <p>For volunteers who need their medication refrigerated, such as insulin
   for diabetics, there is refrigeration available at the hotels. If you
   do have medication that needs to be refrigerated, please notify the
   Global Volunteers office ahead of time, so that your team leader can
   make the appropriate arrangements.

   <h<CLIMATE
   


   <h>What is the weather like?
   <p>The temperatures in southern Italy range from very warm in the summer
   months to cold and blustery in the winter. Weather in the early spring
   and the late fall can be quite variable. For example, in March and
   November, it is not unknown to have some days approach 65 degrees F
   while other days the temperature hovers around freezing. If you're
   traveling between February and early April or between late October and
   early December, we recommend that you bring clothes for all weather
   conditions.


   <h>How does the temperature vary?
   <p>January and February are the coldest months, with temperatures ranging
   from the low 50s during the day to the low 30s at night. June through
   September are the warmest months. The rainy season begins in October
   or November and typically lasts until March, and during those months
   you can expect cool and rainy or damp weather. During the rest of the
   year, temperatures range between 55 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.


   <h>What is the altitude?
   <p>Ostuni-based teams stay in a hilly area several hundred feet above sea
   level. Manduria and Monopoli teams are almost exactly at sea level.


                              

               <h>If you don't find an answer to your question,

   <h>MONEY
   


   <h>What is the local currency?
   <p>The local currency is the euro. As of March 1, 2002, the lira was no
   longer accepted as legal tender.



   <h>What is the current exchange rate?
   
   <p>For currency conversion information, refer to the following website:
   FXConverter.



   <h>Where do I exchange money?
   
     <h>At the airport in Brindisi:
     
     <p>The airport exchange is often closed because Brindisi is not an
     international terminal. Therefore, if you are concerned about not
     having euros before you get to the hotel, we recommend that you
     change money in Rome or Milan during a layover.

     <h>In Rome or Milan:
     
     <p>Most volunteers will have a layover of a few hours in Rome or Milan
     before boarding a flight to Brindisi. We recommend that you
     exchange a small amount of money at the airport in Rome or Milan
     (about USD50 should be enough).

     <h>In Ostuni:
     <p>Beginning on the first Monday of the service program you can
     exchange money in Ostuni at several different banks. Banks are
     generally open Monday - Friday from 8:00 AM - 1:00 PM and from 3:00
     PM - 4:00 PM.



   <h>Can I use cash, credit cards or checks?
   
     <h>Credit Cards.
     
     <p>A debit card can be used to get cash 24 hours a day. There are
     several outside ATM machines in Ostuni, Monopoli, and Manduria that
     can be accessed anytime of the day. Additionally, a good exchange
     rate is available with the debit card, and there is no fee
     associated with withdrawals. A credit card can also be used for
     getting cash from an ATM (please contact your credit card company
     for the four-digit PIN number), though there is a service charge as
     well as interest on cash advances. Credit cards are not accepted at
     most stores in Ostuni.

     <h>Traveler's Checks:
     
     <p>While traveler's checks are still a safe method of safeguarding
     cash when traveling, they are not the most convenient. The banks in
     this area of Italy are not as accustomed to American tourists as
     are the cities in northern Italy. As a result, the process for
     changing traveler's checks can be arduous. There can be as much as
     a 30-minute wait, and most businesses close between 1:00 PM and
     5:00 PM, making it difficult, though not impossible, to plan trips
     to the bank within the program schedule.

     <h>Cash:
     
     <p>If you are bringing U.S. cash, bear in mind that torn, worn, or
     defaced bills are often not accepted. Torn traveler's checks might
     also not be accepted. US 100-dollar bills are sometimes viewed with
     suspicion at smaller banks, though at large ones, particularly
     those in large cities, the $100 bill is the one most commonly
     exchanged. In the towns where we serve, volunteers have had no
     problems exchanging $20 and $50 bills.



   <h>How much money should I bring with me?
   <p>How much you bring depends on your personal spending and shopping
   habits and whether or not you want to go on an excursion during free
   time on the weekend. Weekend trips can cost between USD100 - 300,
   depending on where you go, and the transportation and accommodations
   used. Your souvenir budget is discretionary. Most shops are open for
   business during the morning hours and then are closed in the afternoon
   from 1:00 PM - 3:00 or 5:00 PM. Stores then re-open in the evening
   around 7:00 PM. Postage for postcards costs about .60 euros.



                             

               <h>If you don't find an answer to your question,

   <h>COMMUNICATIONS


   <h>How can my family contact me while I am in Italy?
   <p>In the event of an emergency, your family should refer to the contact
   sheet that you will receive prior to your departure for Italy. This
   will include phone numbers for the hotel where you will be staying,
   our hosts in Italy, and Global Volunteers business and after hours
   phones. Be sure to leave a copy with them.


   <h>What about international phone calls?

   <p>There will be phones and faxes locally available for you to use for
   international communication. However, using locally purchased phone
