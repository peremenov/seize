                                with nature



   <p>Grannys Garden School uses the school grounds to help kids discover
   the nature in their own back yards, experience the satisfaction of
   growing and preparing their own food and the simple pleasure of
   picking a flower.

   <p>We commend the Loveland school board, superintendent and principals
   for creating an environment where an organization such as ours could
   evolve. Their willingness to expand educational opportunities outside
   of the four walls of the traditional classroom make it possible to
   offer a unique learning opportunity to our students.
