<h>Nutrient Solutions

   <p>Check solution level. Sufficient quantity must be available to
   maintain stable solution properties. A small reservoir will require
   more frequent amendments to keep the nutrient concentrations and pH
   within the acceptable range. The two most important of these
   properties is, ionic strength and acid balance. Respectively, the
   concentration of soluble salts (nutrient elements) and the pH, which
   is the acid/ base balance that regulates the interactions and
   availability of these elements.

<h>Fertilizer Concentration

   <p>Fertilizer concentrations can be easily measured with inexpensive
   electronic meters. Element concentrations can be measured by their
   ability to conduct electricity through a solution. Since every element
   in a multi-element solution has a different conductivity factor, these
   measurements are only approximate. Pure water will not conduct
   current, but as you add elemental salts ( mostly metals ) conductivity
   increases proportionately. Simple electronic meters can measure this
   value and interpret it as total dissolved solids ( TDS ). Nutrient
   solution concentrations suitable for plant nourishment generally range
   between 500 and 2000 parts per million ( ppm ).If the solution
   concentration is to high, the internal osmotic systems can reverse and
   actually dehydrate the plant. For general purpose, try to maintain a
   moderate value of approximately 800 to 1200 ppm. These levels can be
   effected by plant absorption or by water evaporation. As the plants
   use the nutrients, the solution weakens, but as the water evaporates
   from the solution, the salt concentration increases. Adjust values by
   either adding fertilizer or diluting with water. Use luke warm water
   and try to maintain a solution temperature between 60 and 80 degrees.
   Use a complete and soluble high quality hydroponic fertilizer
   according to recommendations on label.

<h>Nutrient Solution pH

   <p>Solution pH ( potential hydrogen ) is extremely critical and must be
   checked often to maintain a nearly neutral balance. Variations either
   way will effect the breakdown and solubility of the nutrient
   compounds. Acceptable values vary slightly with different plants, grow
   mediums, and hydroponic systems. Generally desirable readings range
   from 5.5 ( slightly acid ) to 7.0 ( neutral ). For general purposes,
   try to maintain a value of 6.5 and make a correction if readings vary
   +/- a half point. The tolerance range therefore is 6.0 to 7.0 . Use pH
   up and down adjusters carefully and mix in slowly and completely.
   Fertilizers, when added will usually lower the solutions pH value.
   Most of the time, as solutions are used by plants, the pH will raise,
   and additions of fertilizer, or a pH down adjuster will be needed. It
   is preferable to adjust water pH before adding fertilizer, once you
   are familiar with what adjustments will be required. Solution pH can
   be determined either by a reagent color comparison method or with an
   electronic test meter.

<h>Solution Maintenance

   <p>Solutions can be topped off and corrected in a casual routine (usually
   for about 30 days) at which point they should be replenished with a
   fresh supply. Meanwhile, keep the solution water level constant and
   use an electronic conductivity meter to determine how much additional
   fertilizer will need to be provided. Tanks, trays and plumbing should
   be cleaned and rinsed periodically to remove algae, excess nutrient
   salts, and possible viral or fungal pathogens. A 5% sodium
   hypochlorite solution (bleach) should be used to sterilize the system
   between crops. Monthly leaching ( rinsing ) of substrate (grow medium)
   by clear watering is advised to reduce accumulation of soluble salts,
   and avoid a toxic build up of immobile trace elements.


<h>Solution pH

   <p>Solution pH (potential hydrogen) controls the availability of ions to
   be assimilated into the plant. Solution pH is displayed on a scale
   from 0 to 14 with 7 being neutral. All values less are considered
   acidic, and all values greater are alkaline. Plant solutions are
   generally considered desirable between 6.0 and 7.0 pH.

                         <h>Deficiencies and Toxicity

   <h>Mobile elements
   <p>Mobile elements are more likely to exibit visual deficiencies in the
   older leaves, because during demand these elements will be exported to
   the new growth.

<h>Nitrogen

   <p>Deficiency: Plants will exhibit lack of vigor as older leaves become
   yellow (chlorotic) from lack of chlorophyll. Chlorosis will eventually
   spread throughout the plant. Stems, petioles and lower leaf surfaces
   may turn purple.

   <p>Toxicity:Leaves are often dark green and in the early stages abundant
   with foliage. If excess is severe, leaves will dry and begin to fall
   off. Root system will remain under developed or deteriorate after
   time. Fruit and flower set will be inhibited or deformed.

<h>Phosphorus

   <p>Deficiency:Plants are stunted and older leaves often dark dull green
   in color. Stems, petioles may turn purple. Plant maturity is often
   delayed.

   <p>Toxicity:This condition is rare and usually buffered by pH
   limitations. Excess phosphorus can interfere with the availability of
   copper and zinc.

<h>Potassium

   <p>Deficiency:Older leaves are initially chlorotic but soon develop dark
   necrotic lesions (dead tissue). First apparent on the tips and margins
   of the leaves. Stem and branches may become weak and easily broken.

   <p>Toxicity:Usually not absorbed excessively by plants. Excess potassium
   can aggravate the uptake of magnesium, manganese, zinc and iron.

<h>Magnesium

   <p>Deficiency:The older leaves will be the first to develop interveinal
   chlorosis. Starting at leaf margin or tip and progressing inward
   between the veins.

   <p>Toxicity:Magnesium toxicity is rare and not generally exhibited
   visibly.

<h>Zinc

   <p>Deficiency:Chlorosis may accompany reduction of leaf size and a
   shortening between internodes. Leaf margins are often distorted or
   wrinkled.

   <p>Toxicity:Zinc in excess is extremely toxic and will cause rapid death.
   Excess zinc interferes with iron causing chlorosis from iron
   deficiency.


   <h>Immobile elements
   <p>Immobile elements will show their first symptoms on younger leaves and
   progress to the whole plant.

<h>Sulfur

   <p>Deficiency:The initial symptoms are the yellowing of the entire leaf
   including veins usually starting with the younger leaves. Leaf tips
   may yellow and curl downward.

   <p>Toxicity:Leaf size will be reduced and overall growth will be stunted.
   Leaves yellowing or scorched at edges.

<h>Calcium

   <p>Deficiency:Young leaves are affected first and become small and
   distorted or chlorotic with irregular margins, spotting or necrotic
   areas. Bud development is inhibited and root may be under developed or
   die back. Fruit may be stunted or deformed.

   <p>Toxicity:Difficult to distinguish visually. May precipitate with
   sulfur in solution and cause clouding or residue in tank.

<h>Iron

   <p>Deficiency:Pronounced interveinal chlorosis similar to that caused by
   magnesium deficiency but on the younger leaves.

   <p>Toxicity:Excess accumulation is rare but could cause bronzing or tiny
   brown spots on leaf surface.

<h>Manganese

   <p>Deficiency:Interveinal chlorosis on younger or older leaves followed
   by necrotic lesions or leaf shedding. Restricted growth and failure to
   mature normally can also result.

   <p>Toxicity:Chlorosis, or blotchy leaf tissue due to insufficient
   chlorophyll synthesis. Growth rate will slow and vigor will decline.

<h>Chlorine

   <p>Deficiency:Wilted chlorotic leaves become bronze in color. Roots
   become stunted and thickened near tips.

   <p>Toxicity:Burning of leaf tip or margins. Bronzing, yellowing and leaf
   splitting. Reduced leaf size and lower growth rate.

<h>Boron

   <p>Deficiency:Stem and root apical meristems often die. Root tips often
   become swollen and discolored. Internal tissues may rot and become
   host to fungal disease. Leaves show various symptoms which include
   drying, thickening, distorting, wilting, and chlorotic or necrotic
   spotting.

   <p>Toxicity:Yellowing of leaf tip followed by necrosis of the leaves
   beginning at tips or margins and progressing inward. Some plants are
   especially sensitive to boron accumulation.

<h>Copper

   <p>Deficiency:Young leaves often become dark green and twisted. They may
   die back or just exhibit necrotic spots. Growth and yield will be
   deficient as well.

   <p>Toxicity:Reduced growth followed by symptoms of iron chlorosis,
   stunting, reduced branching, abnormal darkening and thickening of
   roots. This element is essential but extremely toxic in excess.

<h>Molybdenum

   <p>Deficiency:Often interveinal chlorosis which occurs first on older
   leaves, then progressing to the entire plant. Developing severely
   twisted younger leaves which eventually die.

   <p>Toxicity:Excess may cause discoloration of leaves depending on plant
   species. This condition is rare but could occur from accumulation by
   continuous application. Used by the plant in very small quantities.
