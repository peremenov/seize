   <h>What you can do

   <p>Greenhouse gas emissions are directly related to your car's fuel
   consumption, so choosing a fuel-efficient car and being responsible
   about how you use it will reduce its impact on the environment.
   <p>If you're buying a new car, choose a fuel-efficient vehicle from the
   class of vehicle that best suits your needs ...
     * <p>Consult the fuel consumption sticker displayed on new and used
       vehicles.
     * <p>Check and compare the car's environmental credentials using the
       federal government's Green Vehicle Guide.

   <p>For a range of carbon-offset products now available in association
   with Greenfleet, see our Program Partners.
   
   <p>Some tips for fuel-efficient driving:
     * <p>Ensure your car is tuned and serviced regularly. The worst
       polluters on our roads tend to be old cars. If you do drive an
       older car, help the environment by making sure it is tuned
       according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
     * <p>Reduce your speed. Driving more slowly reduces fuel consumption.
       In fact, travelling at 110kph uses up to 25% more fuel than
       cruising at 90kph. For city driving, 60kph is the most fuel
       efficient speed.
     * <p>Drive smoothly. Avoid hard accelerating and heavy braking as it
       uses up a lot more fuel.
     * <p>Travel lightly and remove unnecessary items from your car to
       reduce weight - those golf clubs in the back and the surfboard on
       the roof create extra load and reduce aerodynamics. This will
       improve your fuel consumption and reduce emissions.
     * <p>Make sure your tyres are inflated to the correct pressure, as soft
       tyres cause higher fuel consumption.
     * <p>Filling up past the first click of the fuel nozzle means that fuel
       can be lost through the overflow pipe when you accelerate or go
       around corners.
     * <p>Consider how much you use your air conditioner - it can use up to
       10% extra fuel.
     * <p>Avoid peak-hour. If traffic is stationery, switch off the engine,
       even if you stop for a short time. Idling wastes fuel.
     * <p>Car-pool wherever possible, use public transport or ride a
       bicycle.
     * <p>Motorbikes and powered scooters are a very fuel-efficient form of
       transport, with reduced environmental impact.
