<h>Undergraduate Minor in Education

<h>The Program

   <p>The Teacher Education Institute does not offer a program leading to an
   undergraduate degree, however it does offer undergraduate students a
   minor in education that introduces students to the profession of
   education and provides students an opportunity to explore education as
   a career and obtain a head start on their coursework leading to
   initial teacher certification through the University at Buffalos
   graduate school program, but this minor cannot in itself lead directly
   to teacher certification.

   <p>Although intended for those who will pursue certification in
   Adolescence education (Grades 7-12), the minor can be adapted for
   those interested in Early Childhood Education (birth to Grade 2)
   and/or Childhood Education (Grades 1-6).

<h>Acceptance Criteria

   <p>Registration is open to students who formally apply to the minor and
   who receive confirmation of acceptance prior to registration.
   Applications to the minor must be filed with the Teacher Education
   Institution (TEI) office in 375 Baldy Hall. Applications must include
   UB DARS report and/or official transcripts from all institutions
   attended other than UB. Students must have a minimum GPA of 2.5 for
   admission.

<h>Course Sequence

   <p>The minor in education consists of 19 credits as described below.

     * <l>LAI 350 Introduction to Education (4 credit hours)

<h>Recommended Sequence of Courses

<h>First Year (sophomore year)

   <p>Spring: LAI 350 (prerequisite for CEP 400 & ELP 405)

<h>Second Year

   <p>Fall: CEP 400, ELP 405 (prerequisite for LAI 414)
   <p>Spring: LAI 414 or elective

<h>Third Year

   <p>Fall: Two courses from the list of electives

   <p>The first course (LAI 350) in the minor is an introductory course that
   is not part of the required coursework for certification. It does,
   however, have a field experience component, and early field
   experiences are required in the latest NYS Education Department
   regulations.

   <p>The next two courses, CEP 400 and ELP 405, can be used to meet
   requirements for initial certification as an Adolescence teacher. The
   final three courses in the minor are electives, which may also meet
   teacher certification course requirements (depending upon which
   curricular option the student eventually pursues).

   <p>Students who take CEP 400, ELP 405, and LAI 414, and complete them
   successfully, and who later pursue a UB program leading to initial
   teacher certification at the Adolescence level may include these
   courses in their coursework toward initial certification (but not the
   masters degree). This allows students to have a 9-credit head start
   toward their initial certification.

<h>Provisional Admission into the Teacher Certification Program

   <p>Students who have completed 75 undergraduate credits in an approved
   major with a minimum GPA of 3.0 can apply on-line to an initial
   certification (i.e., advanced certificate without an Ed.M. degree) or
   initial/professional certification program (with Ed.M. degree) for
   provisional admission pending completion of their undergraduate
   degree. Students who have been provisionally admitted and who have
   completed 90 undergraduate credits may take two graduate level
   education courses (upon advisement) and include them in their graduate
   program in education.
