<h>'One huge US jail'

   <p>Afghanistan is the hub of a global network of detention centres, the
   frontline in America's 'war on terror', where arrest can be random and
   allegations of torture commonplace. Adrian Levy and Cathy Scott-Clark
   investigate on the ground and talk to former prisoners
   <h>Saturday March 19, 2005

   <p>Kabul was a grim, monastic place in the days of the Taliban; today
   it's a chaotic gathering point for every kind of prospector and
   carpetbagger. Foreign bidders vying for billions of dollars of
   telecoms, irrigation and construction contracts have sparked a
   property boom that has forced up rental prices in the Afghan capital
   to match those in London, Tokyo and Manhattan. Four years ago, the
   Ministry of Vice and Virtue in Kabul was a tool of the Taliban
   inquisition, a drab office building where heretics were locked up for
   such crimes as humming a popular love song. Now it's owned by an
   American entrepreneur who hopes its bitter associations won't scare
   away his new friends.

   <p>Outside Kabul, Afghanistan is bleaker, its provinces more inaccessible
   and lawless, than it was under the Taliban. If anyone leaves town,
   they do so in convoys. Afghanistan is a place where it is easy for
   people to disappear and perilous for anyone to investigate their fate.
   Even a seasoned aid agency such as Médécins Sans Frontières was forced
   to quit after five staff members were murdered last June. Only the
   17,000-strong US forces, with their all-terrain Humvees and Apache
   attack helicopters, have the run of the land, and they have used the
   haze of fear and uncertainty that has engulfed the country to advance
   a draconian phase in the war against terror. Afghanistan has become
   the new Guantánamo Bay.

   <p>Washington likes to hold up Afghanistan as an exemplar of how a rogue
   regime can be replaced by democracy. Meanwhile, human-rights activists
   and Afghan politicians have accused the US military of placing
   Afghanistan at the hub of a global system of detention centres where
   prisoners are held incommunicado and allegedly subjected to torture.
   The secrecy surrounding them prevents any real independent
   investigation of the allegations. "The detention system in Afghanistan
   exists entirely outside international norms, but it is only part of a
   far larger and more sinister jail network that we are only now
   beginning to understand," Michael Posner, director of the US legal
   watchdog Human Rights First, told us.

   <p>When we landed in Kabul, Afghanistan was blue with a bruising cold. We
   were heading for the former al-Qaida strongholds in the south-east
   that were rumoured to be the focus of the new US network. How should
   we prepare, we asked local UN staff. "Don't go," they said. None the
   less, we were able to find a driver, a Pashtun translator and a boxful
   of clementines, and set off on a five-and-a-half-hour trip south
   through the snow to Gardez, a market town dominated by two rapidly
   expanding US military bases.

   <p>There we met Dr Rafiullah Bidar, regional director of the Afghan
   Independent Human Rights Commission, established in 2003 with funding
   from the US Congress to investigate abuses committed by local warlords
   and to ensure that women's and children's rights were protected. He
   was delighted to see foreigners in town. At his office in central
   Gardez, Bidar showed us a wall of files. "All I do nowadays is chart
   complaints against the US military," he said. "Many thousands of
   people have been rounded up and detained by them. Those who have been
   freed say that they were held alongside foreign detainees who've been
   brought to this country to be processed. No one is charged. No one is
   identified. No international monitors are allowed into the US jails."
   He pulled out a handful of files: "People who have been arrested say
   they've been brutalised - the tactics used are beyond belief." The
   jails are closed to outside observers, making it impossible to test
   the truth of the claims.

   <p>Last November, a man from Gardez died of hypothermia in a US military
   jail. When his family were called to collect the body, they were given
   a $100 note for the taxi ride and no explanation. In scores more
   cases, people have simply disappeared.

   <p>Prisoner transports crisscross the country between a proliferating
   network of detention facilities. In addition to the camps in Gardez,
   there are thought to be US holding facilities in the cities of Khost,
   Asadabad and Jalalabad, as well as an official US detention centre in
   Kandahar, where the tough regime has been nicknamed "Camp Slappy" by
   former prisoners. There are 20 more facilities in outlying US
   compounds and fire bases that complement a major "collection centre"
   at Bagram air force base. The CIA has one facility at Bagram and
   another, known as the "Salt Pit", in an abandoned brick factory north
   of Kabul. More than 1,500 prisoners from Afghanistan and many other
   countries are thought to be held in such jails, although no one knows
   for sure because the US military declines to comment.

   <p>Anyone who has got in the way of the prison transports has been met
   with brutal force. Bidar directed us to a small Shia neighbourhood on
   the edge of town where a multiple killing was still under
   investigation. Inside a frozen courtyard, a former policeman, Said
   Sardar, 25, was sat beside his crutches. On May 1 2004, he was manning
   a checkpoint when a car careened through. "Inside were men dressed
   like Arabs, but they were western men," he said. "They had prisoners
   in the car." Sardar fired a warning shot for the car to stop. "The
   western men returned fire and within minutes two US attack helicopters
   hovered above us. They fired three rockets at the police station. One
   screamed past me. I saw its fiery tail and blacked out."

   <p>He was taken to Bagram, where US military doctors had to amputate his
   leg. Afterwards, he said, "an American woman appeared. She said the US
   was sorry. It was a mistake. The men in the car were Special Forces or
   CIA on a mission. She gave me $500." Sardar showed us into another
   room in his compound where a circle of children stared glumly at us;
   their fathers, all policemen, were killed in the same incident. "Five
   dead. Four in hospital. To protect covert US prisoner transports," he
   says. Later, US helicopters were deployed in two similar incidents
   that left nine dead.

   <p>In his builders' merchant's shop, Mohammed Timouri describes how he
   lost his son. "Ismail was a part-time taxi driver, waiting to go to
   college," he says, handing us a photograph of a beardless,
   short-haired 19-year-old held aloft in a coffin at his funeral last
   March. "A convoy delivering prisoners from a facility in Jalalabad to
   one in Kabul became snarled up in traffic. A US soldier jumped down
   and lifted a woman out of the way. She screamed. Ismail stepped
   forward to explain she was a conservative person, wearing a burka. The
   soldier dropped the woman and shot Ismail in front of a crowd of 20
   people."

   <p>Mohammed received a letter from the Afghan police: "We apologise to
   you," the police chief wrote. "An innocent was killed by Americans."
   The US army declined to comment on Ismail's death or on a second fatal
   shooting by another prison transport at the same crossroads later that
   month. It also refused to comment on an incident outside Kabul when a
   prison patrol reportedly cleared a crowd of children by throwing a
   grenade into their midst. However, we have since heard that the CIA's
   inspector general is investigating at least eight serious incidents,
   including two deaths in custody, following complaints by agents about
   the activities of their military colleagues.

   <p>There are insurgents active in the Gardez area, as there are
   throughout the south of Afghanistan, remnants of the old order and the
   newly disaffected. Every morning it takes Afghan police several hours
   to pick along the highway unearthing explosives concealed overnight.
   And so it was mid-morning before we were able to leave town, crawling
   over the Gardez-Khost pass, some 10,000ft high. No one saw us slipping
   on to the fertile Khost plain, where Osama bin Laden once had his
   training camps - the camps were destroyed by US cruise missiles in
   August 1998. Today a shrine to Taliban loyalists still greets
   travellers to the city, although no one here would say they preferred
   the old life.

   <p>US Camp Salerno, the largest base outside Kabul, dominates the area
   around Khost. Inside the city, Kamal Sadat, a local stringer for BBC
   World Service, told how he was detained last September and found
   himself locked up in a prison filled with suspects from many
   countries. "Even though I showed my press accreditation, I was hooded,
   driven to Salerno and then flown to another US base. I had no idea
   where I was or why I had been detained." He was held in a small wooden
   cell, and soldiers combed through his notebooks, copying down names
   and phone numbers. "Every time I was moved within the base, I was
   hooded again. Every prisoner has to maintain absolute silence. I could
   hear helicopters whirring above me. Prisoners were arriving and
   leaving all the time. There were also cells beneath me, under the
   ground." After three days, Sadat was flown back to Khost and freed
   without explanation. "It was only later I learned that I had been held
   in Bagram. If the BBC had not intervened, I fear I would not have got
   out." After his release, the US military said it had all been a
   misunderstanding, and apologised.

   <p>Camp Salerno, which houses the 1,200 troops of US Combined Taskforce
   Thunder, was being expanded when we arrived. Army tents were being
   replaced with concrete dormitories. The detention facility, concealed
   behind a perimeter of opaque green webbing, was being modernised and
   enlarged. Ensconced in a Soviet-era staff building was the camp's
   commanding officer, Colonel Gary Cheeks. He listened calmly as we
   asked about the allegations of torture, deaths and disappearances at
   US detention facilities including Salerno. We read to him from a
   complaint made by a UN official in Kabul that accused the US military
   of using "cowboy-like excessive force". He eased forward in his chair:
   "There have been some tragic accidents for which we have apologised.
   Some people have been paid compensation."

   <p>We put to him the specific case of Mohammed Khan, from a village near
   the Pakistan border, who died in custody at Camp Salerno: his
   relatives say his body showed signs of torture. "You could go on for
   ages with a 'he said, she said'. You have to take my word for it,"
   said Cheeks. He remembered Khan's death: "He was bitten by a snake and
   died in his cell." He added, "We are building new holding cells here
   to make life better for detainees. We are systematising our prison
   programme across the country."

   <p>For what reason? "So all guards and interrogators behave by the same
   code of behaviour," the colonel said. Is it not the case that an
   ever-increasing number of prisoners have vanished, while others are
   being shuttled between jails to keep their families in the dark?
   Cheeks moved towards his office door: "There are many things that are
   distorted. No one has vanished here ... Look, the war against the
   Taliban is one small part. I want the Afghan people with us. They are
   the key to ending conflict. If they fear us or we do wrong by them,
   then we have lost."

   <p>However, many Afghans who celebrated the fall of the Taliban have long
   lost faith in the US military. In Kabul, Nader Nadery, of the Human
   Rights Commission, told us, "Afghanistan is being transformed into an
   enormous US jail. What we have here is a military strategy that has
   spawned serious human rights abuses, a system of which Afghanistan is
   but one part." In the past 18 months, the commission has logged more
   than 800 allegations of human rights abuses committed by US troops.

   <p>The Afghan government privately shares Nadery's fears. One minister,
   who asked not to be named, said, "Washington holds Afghanistan up to
   the world as a nascent democracy and yet the US military has
   deliberately kept us down, using our country to host a prison system
   that seems to be administered arbitrarily, indiscriminately and
   without accountability."

   <p>What has been glimpsed in Afghanistan is a radical plan to replace
   Guantánamo Bay. When that detention centre was set up in January 2002,
   it was essentially an offshore gulag - beyond the reach of the US
   constitution and even the Geneva conventions. That all changed in July
   2004. The US supreme court ruled that the federal court in Washington
   had jurisdiction to hear a case that would decide if the Cuban
   detentions were in violation of the US constitution, its laws or
   treaties. The military commissions, which had been intended to
   dispense justice to the prisoners, were in disarray, too. No
   prosecution cases had been prepared and no defence cases would be
   readily offered as the US National Association of Criminal Defence
   Lawyers had described the commissions as unethical, a decision backed
   by a federal judge who ruled in January that they were "illegal".
   Guantánamo was suddenly bogged down in domestic lawsuits. It had lost
   its practicality. So a global prison network built up over the
   previous three years, beyond the reach of American and European
   judicial process, immediately began to pick up the slack. The process
   became explicit last week when the Pentagon announced that half of the
   540 or so inmates at Guantánamo are to be transferred to prisons in
   Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia.

   <p>Since September 11 2001, one of the US's chief strategies in its "war
   on terror" has been to imprison anyone considered a suspect on
   whatever grounds. To that end it commandeered foreign jails, built
   cellblocks at US military bases and established covert CIA facilities
   that can be located almost anywhere, from an apartment block to a
   shipping container. The network has no visible infrastructure - no
   prison rolls, visitor rosters, staff lists or complaints procedures.
   Terror suspects are being processed in Afghanistan and in dozens of
   facilities in Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Jordan, Egypt, Thailand, Malaysia,
   Indonesia and the British island of Diego Garcia in the southern
   Indian Ocean. Those detained are held incommunicado, without charge or
   trial, and frequently shuttled between jails in covert air transports,
   giving rise to the recently coined US military expression "ghost
   detainees".

   <p>Most of the countries hosting these invisible prisons are already
   partners in the US coalition. Others, notably Syria, are pragmatic
   associates, which work privately alongside the CIA and US Special
   Forces, despite bellicose public statements from President Bush (he
   has condemned Syria for harbouring terrorism, for aiding the remnants
   of the Saddam Hussein regime, and most recently has demanded that
   Syrian troops quit Lebanon).

   <p>All the host countries are renowned for their poor human rights
   records, enabling interrogators (US soldiers, contractors and their
   local partners) to operate. We have obtained prisoner letters,
   declassified FBI files, legal depositions, witness statements and
   testimony from US and UK officials, which document the alleged methods
   deployed in Afghanistan - shackles, hoods, electrocution, whips, mock
   executions, sexual humiliation and starvation - and suggest they are
   practised across the network. Sir Nigel Rodley, a former UN special
   rapporteur on torture, said, "The more hidden detention practices
   there are, the more likely that all legal and moral constraints on
   official behaviour will be removed."

   <p>The only "ghost detainees" to have been identified by Washington are a
   handful of high-profile al-Qaida operatives such as Abu Zubayda, Bin
   Laden's lieutenant, who vanished after being picked up by Pakistani
   authorities in Faisalabad in March 2002. In June of that year, US
   defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld said Zubayda was "under US control".
   He did not say where, although sources in the Pakistani government
   said Zubayda was being held at a CIA facility in their country.

   <p>In May 2003, Bush clarified the fate of Waleed Muhammad bin Attash, an
   alleged conspirator in the USS Cole bombing, who disappeared after
   being arrested by police in Pakistan in April 2003. Bush described
   Attash as "a killer ... one less person that people who love freedom
   have to worry about"; he is also one more person who has never
   appeared on a US prison roll.

   <p>In June 2004, a senior counterterrorism official in Britain confirmed
   that Hambali (a nom de guerre) - accused of organising the October
   2002 Bali bombings and unseen since Thai police seized him in August
   2003 - was "singing like a bird", apparently at the US base on Diego
   Garcia.

   <p>Evidence we have collected, however, shows that many more of those
   swept up in the network have few provable connections to any outlawed
   organisation; experts in the field describe their value in the war
   against terror as "negligible". Former prisoners claim they were
   released only after naming names, coerced into making false
   confessions that led to the arrests of more people unconnected to
   terrorism, in a system of justice that owes more to Stanley Milgram's
   Six Degrees Of Separation - where anyone can be linked to everyone
   else in the world in as many stages - than to analytical
   jurisprudence.

   <p>The floating population of "ghost detainees", according to US and UK
   military officials, now exceeds 10,000.

   <p>The roots of the prison network can be traced to the legal wrangles
   that began as soon as the first terror suspects were rounded up just
   weeks after the September 11 attacks. As CIA agents and US forces
   began to capture suspected al-Qaida fighters in the war in
   Afghanistan, Alberto Gonzales, White House counsel, looked for ways to
   "dispense justice swiftly, close to where our forces may be fighting,
   without years of pre-trial proceedings or post-trial appeals".

   <p>On November 13 2001, George Bush signed an order to establish military
   commissions to try "enemy belligerents" who commit war crimes. At such
   a commission, a foreign war criminal would have no choice over his
   defence counsel, no right to know the evidence against him, no way of
   obtaining any evidence in his favour and no right of attorney-client
   confidentiality. Defending the commissions, Gonzales (now promoted to
   US attorney general) insisted, "The suggestion that [they] will afford
   only sham justice like that dispensed in dictatorial nations is an
   insult to our military justice system."

   <p>When the first prisoners arrived at Guantánamo Bay in January 2002,
   Donald Rumsfeld announced that they were all Taliban or al-Qaida
   fighters, and as such were designated "unlawful combatants". The US
   administration argued that al-Qaida and the Taliban were not the
   official army of Afghanistan, but a criminal force that did not wear
   uniforms, could not be distinguished from civilians and practised war
   crimes; on this basis, the administration claimed, it was entitled to
   sidestep the Geneva conventions and normal legal constraints.

   <p>From there, it was only a small moral step for the Bush administration
   to overlook the use of torture by regimes previously condemned by the
   US state department, so long as they, too, signed up to the war
   against terror. "Egypt, Jordan, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia,
   Pakistan, Uzbekistan and even Syria were all asked to make their
   detention facilities and expert interrogators available to the US,"
   one former counterterrorism agent told us.

   <p>In the UK, a similar process began unfolding. In December 2001, the
   then home secretary David Blunkett withdrew Britain from its
   obligation under the European human rights treaty not to detain anyone
   without trial; on December 18, the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security
   Act was passed, extending the government's powers of arrest and
   detention. Within 24 hours, 10 men were seized in dawn raids on their
   homes and taken to Belmarsh and Woodhill prisons (some of them will
   have been among those released in the past week).

   <p>Subsequently the Foreign Office subtly modified internal guidance to
   diplomats, enabling them to use intelligence obtained through torture.
   A letter from the Foreign & Commonwealth Office directorate sent to
   Sir Michael Jay, head of the diplomatic service, and Mathew Kidd of
   Whitehall liaison, a euphemism for MI6, suggested in March 2003 that
   although such intelligence was inadmissible as evidence in a UK court,
   it could still be received and acted upon by the British government.
   The government's attitude was spelt out to the Intelligence and
   Security Committee of MPs and peers by foreign secretary Jack Straw
   who, while acknowledging that torture was "completely unacceptable"
   and that information obtained under torture is more likely to be
   embellished, concluded, "you cannot ignore it if the price of ignoring
   it is 3,000 people dead" [a reference to the September 11 attacks].

   <p>One former ambassador told us, "This was new ground for the FCO. As
   long as we didn't do it, we're OK. But by taking advantage of this
   intelligence, we're encouraging the use of torture and, in my opinion,
   are in contravention of the UN Convention Against Torture. What
   worried me most was that information obtained under torture, given
   credence by some gung-ho Whitehall warrior, could be used to keep
   another poor soul locked up without trial or charge."

   <p>Although the true extent of the US extra-legal network is only now
   becoming apparent, people began to disappear as early as 2001 when the
   US asked its allies in Europe and the Middle East to examine their
   refugee communities in search of possible terror cells, such as that
   run by Mohammed Atta in Hamburg which had planned and executed the
   September 11 attacks. Among the first to vanish was Ahmed Agiza, an
   Egyptian asylum seeker who had been living in Sweden with his wife and
   children for three years. Hanan, Agiza's wife, told us how on December
   18 2001 her husband failed to return home from his language class.

   <p>"The phone rang at 5pm. It was Ahmed. He said he'd been arrested and
   then the line went dead. The next day our lawyer told me that Ahmed
   was being sent back to Egypt. It would be better if he was dead."
   Agiza and his family had fled Egypt in 1991, after years of
   persecution, and in absentia he had been sentenced to life
   imprisonment by a military court. Hanan said, "I called my
   mother-in-law in Egypt. Finally, in April, she was allowed to see
   Ahmed in Mazrah Torah prison, in Cairo, when he revealed what had
   happened."

   <p>On December 18 2001, Agiza and a second Egyptian refugee, Mohammed
   Al-Zery, had been arrested by Swedish intelligence acting upon a
   request from the US. They were driven, shackled and blindfolded, to
   Stockholm's Bromma airport, where they were cuffed and cut from their
   clothes. Suppositories were inserted into both men's anuses, they were
   wrapped in plastic nappies, dressed in jumpsuits and handed over to an
   American aircrew who flew them out of Sweden on a private executive
   jet.

   <p>Agiza and Al-Zery landed in Cairo at 3am the next morning and were
   taken to the state security investigation office, where they were held
   in solitary confinement in underground cells. Mohammed Zarai, former
   director of the Cairo-based Human Rights Centre for the Assistance of
   Prisoners, told us that Agiza was repeatedly electrocuted, hung upside
   down, whipped with an electrical flex and hospitalised after being
   made to lick his cell floor clean. Hanan, who was granted asylum in
   Sweden in 2004, said, "I can't sleep at night without expecting
   someone to knock on the door and send us away on a plane to a place
   that scares me more than anything else. What can Ahmed do?" Her
   husband is still incarcerated in Cairo, while Al-Zery is under house
   arrest there. There have been calls for an international independent
   investigation into the roles of the Swedish, US and Egyptian
   authorities.

   <p>We were able to chart the toing and froing of the private executive
   jet used at Bromma partly through the observations of plane-spotters
   posted on the web and partly through a senior source in the Pakistan
   Inter Services Intelligence agency (ISI). It was a Gulfstream V Turbo,
   tailfin number N379P; its flight plans always began at an airstrip in
   Smithfield, North Carolina, and ended in some of the world's hot
   spots. It was owned by Premier Executive Transport Services,
   incorporated in Delaware, a brass plaque company with nonexistent
   directors, hired by American agents to revive an old CIA tactic from
   the 1970s, when agency men had kidnapped South American criminals and
   flown them back to their own countries to face trial so that justice
   could be rendered. Now "rendering" was being used by the Bush
   administration to evade justice.

   <p>Robert Baer, a CIA case officer in the Middle East until 1997, told us
   how it works. "We pick up a suspect or we arrange for one of our
   partner countries to do it. Then the suspect is placed on civilian
   transport to a third country where, let's make no bones about it, they
   use torture. If you want a good interrogation, you send someone to
   Jordan. If you want them to be killed, you send them to Egypt or
   Syria. Either way, the US cannot be blamed as it is not doing the
   heavy work."

   <p>The Agiza and Al-Zery cases were not the first in which the Gulfstream
   was used. On October 23 2001, at 2.40am at Karachi airport, it picked
   up Jamil Qasim Saeed Mohammed, a Yemeni microbiologist who had been
   arrested by Pakistan's ISI and was wanted in connection with the USS
   Cole attack. On January 10 2002, the jet was used again, taking off
   from Halim airport in Jakarta with a hooded and shackled Mohammed
   Saeed Iqbal Madni on board, an Egyptian accused of being an accomplice
   of British shoe bomber Richard Reid. Madni was flown to Cairo where,
   according to the Human Rights Centre for the Assistance of Prisoners,
   he died during interrogation.

   <p>Since then, the jet has been used at least 72 times, including a
   flight in June 2002 when it landed in Morocco to pick up German
   national Mohammed Zamar, who was "rendered" to Syria, his country of
   origin, before disappearing.

   <p>It was in December 2001 that the US began to commandeer foreign jails
   so that its own interrogators could work on prisoners within them.
   Among the first were Haripur and Kohat, no-frills prisons in the
   lawless North West Frontier Province of Pakistan which now hold nearly
   as many detainees as Guantánamo. In January, we attempted to visit
   Kohat jail, but as we drove towards the security perimeter our vehicle
   was turned back by ISI agents and we were escorted back to the nearby
   city of Peshawar. We eventually located several former detainees,
   including Mohammed, a university student who described how he was
   arrested and then initially interrogated in one of many covert ISI
   holding centres that are being jointly run with the CIA. Mohammed
   said, "I was questioned for four weeks in a windowless room by
   plain-clothed US agents. I didn't know if it was day or night. They
   said they could make me disappear." One day he was bundled into a
   vehicle. "I arrived in Kohat jail. There were 100 prisoners from all
   over the Middle East. Later I was moved to Haripur where there were
   even more."

   <p>Adil, another detainee who was held for three years in Haripur after
   illegally crossing into Pakistan from Afghanistan, where he had
   escaped from the Taliban, says, "US interrogators came and went as
   they pleased." Both Mohammed and Adil said they were often taken from
   the hot cell and doused with ice-cold water. Adil says, "American
   women ordered us to get undressed. They'd touch us and taunt us. They
   made us lie naked on top of each other and simulate acts."

   <p>Mohammed and Adil were released without charge in November 2004 but,
   according to legal depositions, there are still 400 prisoners detained
   in the jails at the request of the US. Among them are many who it is
   extremely unlikely took part in the Afghan war: they are too young or
   too old to have been combatants. Some have taken legal action against
   the Pakistani authorities for breach of human rights.

   <p>A military intelligence official in Washington told us that no one in
   the US administration seemed concerned about the impact of the
   coercive tactics practised by the growing global network on the
   quality of intelligence obtained, although there was plenty of
   evidence it was unreliable. On September 26 2002, Maher Arar, a
   34-year-old Canadian computer scientist, was arrested at New York's
   JFK airport as a result of a paper-thin evidential chain. Syrian-born
   Arar told us, "I was pulled aside by US immigration at 2pm. I told
   them I had a connecting flight to Montreal where I had a job
   interview." However, Arar was "rendered" in a private jet, via
   Washington, Portland and Rome, landing in Amman, Jordan, where he was
   held at what a Jordanian source described as a US-run interrogation
   centre. From there, he was handed over to Syria, the country he had
   left as a 17-year-old boy. He says he spent the next 12 months being
   tortured and in solitary confinement, unaware that someone he barely
   knew had named him as a terrorist.

   <p>The chain of events that led to Arar's arrest, or kidnapping, began in
   November 2001, when another Canadian, Ahmad Abou El-Maati, from
   Montreal, was arrested at Damascus airport. He was accused of being a
   terrorist and asked to identify his al-Qaida connections. By the time
   he'd endured two years of torture, El-Maati had reeled off the names
   of everyone he knew in Montreal, including Abdullah Almalki, an
   electrical engineer. Almalki was arrested as he flew into Damascus
   airport to join his parents on holiday in May 2002, and would spend
   the next two years being tortured in a Syrian detention facility.

   <p>Almalki knew Arward Al-Bousha, also from Ottawa, who in July 2002,
   upon arriving in Damascus to visit his dying father, was also
   arrested. El-Maati, Almalki and Al-Bousha all knew Maher Arar by sight
   through Muslim community events in Ottawa. After his release from jail
   in Syria, uncharged, in January 2004, El-Maati admitted that he had
   erroneously named Maher Arar as a terrorist to "stop the vicious
   torture". Arar, who was eventually released in October 2003 after a
   Syrian court threw out a coerced confession in which he said he had
   been trained by al-Qaida, told us, "I am not a terrorist. I don't know
   anyone who is. But the tolerant Muslim community I come from here in
   Canada has become vitriolic and demoralised." Arar's case is now the
   subject of a judicial inquiry in Canada, but since his release and
   that of Al-Bousha and Almalki, another five men from Ottawa have been
   detained in Syria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.

   <p>Five days after the US supreme court ruled in July 2004 that federal
   courts had jurisdiction over Guantánamo, Naeem Noor Khan, a
   25-year-old computer programmer from Karachi, disappeared during a
   business trip to Lahore. He was not taken to Guantánamo. His father
   Hayat told us that he learned of his son's fate after a neighbour
   called on August 2 to say that US newspapers were running a story
   about "the capture of a figure from al-Qaida in Pakistan" who had led
   "the CIA to a rich lode of information". An unnamed US intelligence
   official claimed Naeem Noor Khan operated websites and email addresses
   for al-Qaida. The following day Pakistan's information minister
   trumpeted the ISI's seizure of Naeem Noor Khan on behalf of the US on
   July 13. The prisoner had "confessed to receiving 25 days of military
   training from an al-Qaida camp in June 1998". No corroborative
   evidence was offered.

   <p>Babar Awan, one of Pakistan's leading advocates, representing the
   family, said he had learned from a contact in the Pakistani government
   that Naeem Noor Khan was wanted by the US, having been named by one of
   a group of Malaysian students who had been detained incommunicado and
   threatened with torture in Pakistan in September 2003. Awan said, "The
   student was subsequently freed uncharged and described how he was
   threatened until he offered the names of anyone he had met in
   Pakistan. There is no evidence against Naeem Noor Khan except for this
   coerced statement, and even worse he has now vanished and so there is
   no prison to petition for his release."

   <p>Khan had been swallowed up by a catch-all system that gathers up
   anyone connected by even a thread to terror. Unable to distinguish its
   friends from its enemies, the US suspects both.

   <p>Dawn broke on the festival of Eid and four US army vehicles gunned
   their engines in preparation for a "hearts and minds" operation in
   Khost city, Afghanistan. A roll call of marines, each with their blood
   group scrawled on their boots, was ticked off and we were added to the
   muster. The convoy hurtled towards the city. Men and boys began to run
   alongside. First a handful and then a dozen. The crowd was heading for
   a vast prayer ground, and soon there were thousands of devotees in
   brand newEid caps and starched shalwas marching out to pray. The US
   Humvees pulled over. The armoured personnel carriers, too. A dozen US
   marines stepped down, eyes obscured by goggles, faces by balaclavas.

   <p>They fell into formation and stomped into the crowd while a group of
   Afghan police looked on incredulously. "Keep tight. Keep tight. Keep
   looking all around us," a US marines captain shouted. More than 10,000
   Pashtun men were now on their knees praying as a line of khaki pushed
   between them.

   <p>An egg flew. Then another. "One more, sir, and the guy who did it is
   going down," a young sergeant mumbled, as the disturbed crowd rose to
   its feet. Bearded men with Kalashnikovs emerged from behind a stone
   wall and edged towards us, cutting off our path. The line of khaki
   began to panic, and jostled the children. "Back away, back away now,"
   shouted the sergeant. Suddenly an armoured personnel carrier roared to
   meet us. "Jump up, people," the captain shouted, and the convoy sped
   back to Camp Salerno.

   <p>And perhaps this event above all others - of a nervous phalanx of US
   marines forcing its way across a prayer ground on one of the holiest,
   most joyous days in the Islamic calendar, an itching trigger away from
   a Somalian-style dogfight of their own making - is the one that
   encapsulates everything that has gone wrong with the global war
   against terror. The US army came to Afghanistan as liberators and now
   are feared as governors, judges and jailers. How many US marines know
   what James Madison, an architect of the US constitution, wrote in
   1788? Reflecting on the War of Independence in which Americans were
   arbitrarily arrested and detained without trial by British forces,
   Madison concluded that the "accumulation of all powers, legislative,
   executive and judiciary, in the same hands may justly be pronounced
   the very definition of tyranny"
