   <h>NATFHE unanimous support for Bolivarian Revolution Print E-mail 
   <h>Wednesday, 01 June 2005

   <p>Hands Off Venezuela supporters organised a stall at the conference and
   we were able to distribute literature and collect 130 signatures
   (about half of conference delegates) for our open letter to the US
   trade union movement, including many of the leaders of the union.
   There was a lot of interest in our stall, delegates were keen to hear
   about events in Latin America and we had some very interesting
   discussions. We also made some important new links for the campaign
   with several delegates agreeing to organise film screenings in their
   colleges.

   <h>Fringe meeting

   <p>We held a joint fringe meeting, with Justice For Columbia and the
   Cuban Ambassador in the conference hall on Saturday evening. The
   attendance, of around 35, was not bad considering it was cut across to
   some extent by the late finish of conference and other meetings taking
   place at the same time.

   <p>Zelmys Dominguez, Political Counsellor of the Cuban Embassy spoke
   first and highlighted the role that Cuba has played in helping other
   countries around the world develop their health and education systems
   by providing teachers and doctors. This has been very important in
   Venezuela. She also explained that US imperialism has been trying to
   isolate Cuba, and that international labour movement support has been
   important.

   <p>The next to speak was Hubert de Jesus Ballesteros, Deputy Leader of
   the Fensuagro, the Colombian agricultural workers union, who talked
   about the climate of repression that exists for trade unionists in
   Colombia. He explained that assassination of leaders and activists is
   a standard way for the bosses to deal with the unions, and even
   `respectable' multinationals are implicated in this.

   <p>Noting that there are stark contrasts in Latin America, from the
   severe repression of Colombia to the situation in Venezuela that is
   strongly in favour of the working class, the chair, NEC member Maire
   Daley, introduced Jorge Martin from the Hands Off Venezuela campaign.

   <p>Jorge talked about recent pressure by US imperialism to isolate
   Venezuela diplomatically. A recent article by Otto Reich, describes
   Castro and Chavez as an axis of evil, while high profile trips to
   Latin America by Condoleeza Rice and Donald Rumsfelt have attempted to
   stir up opposition. These attempts have so far been unsuccessful.

   <p>He explained that the masses have been the driving force of the
   revolution at every stage, first in overturning the successful
   opposition coup, then in saving the economy by taking over the running
   of industry at the time of the bosses lockout and finally in defeating
   the opposition during the recall referendum. He went on to list the
   social gains of the revolution which include the nationalisation of
   certain factories under workers control, the distribution of unused
   land to the peasants and the extensive social programme which is
   introducing universal healthcare and eradicating illiteracy.

   <p>There was a lively discussion that focused on how best to build links
   with the workers in each of these countries, especially Colombia and
   Venezuela, and on what we can do to help. The meeting helped to
   prepare the ground for the motion before conference to support
   Venezuela.

   <h>Conference motion

   <p>The motion on Venezuela was heard in the international discussion on
   Monday morning. The mover of the motion, Darrel Cozens from West
   Midlands region, drew attention to the gains that the revolution has
   meant for ordinary people, pointing to the social programmes that are
   bringing health and education to young and old. He also explained that
   Venezuela has become a beacon of hope to the oppressed across Latin
   America, noting especially the recent demonstrations and uprisings in
   Bolivia over multinationals exploiting the country's gas reserves.

   <p>The speakers on the motion were very well received and the motion
   unanimously supported. This opens the way for greater links between
   this union and those in Venezuela and this will be further advanced by
   the commitment to participate in a joint union delegation to Venezuela
   to see the revolution in action.

   <p>The conference was a step forward for the campaign and has given us
   many new links and points off support to build upon. The task now is
   to follow up on these and use them to spread the word about the
   Bolivarian Revolution and Hands Off Venezuela, to which NATFHE already
   agree to affiliate at last year's conference.

   <h>Text of the motion:

     <p>This conference congratulates and supports the Bolivarian
     Revolution and the Venezuelan government for utilising the
     country's wealth and resources for reforms to benefit the working
     class, the poor and the landless.

     <p>Conference views with alarm however the bellicose statements being
     made by the USA and its allies Columbia and the financial oligarchy
     in Venezuela which pose a real threat to these reforms.

     <p>Conference agrees to join with the NUJ to organise a trade union
     delegation to Venezuela in solidarity with the Revolution and to
     support a delegation to the World Youth Festival in Caracas in
     August 2005.
