   <p>I'm in Boston for the holidays, and today I did one of the few things
   you can do in New England that you just can't do in California--I went
   candlepin bowling. While I waited for my friend Deb to arrive at the
   alley, I checked out its video games--and found that one of them was
   The Act, an "interactive romantic comedy" which I'd read about on
   Cartoon Brew earlier this year.


  <p> The Act is tough to describe, but virtually every reference I've seen
   to it brings up Don Bluth's Dragon's Lair, and that's as good a frame
   of reference as any, although this new game is vastly more interesting
   than the Bluth one. It's an arcade game done in full character
   animation--amazingly, maybe the first since those Bluth laserdisc
   games of the 1980s, even though the technology is far more practical
   these days. But while the Bluth games' themes were pretty much exactly
   the same as other early arcade games, The Act is indeed a romantic
   comedy, involving a klutzy window washer, a sexy nurse, an unpleasant
   boss, and other characters. I'm not sure if the parallels are
   intentional, but it reminds me a lot of a Harold Lloyd film. (In part
   because there's no dialog--or at least I didn't hear any during the
   section of the game I was able to get through before losing.)

   <p>Dragon's Lair was a game with a simple input device (a joystick) and
   game play that was almost beside the point (you thrashed the joystick
   around, but it didn't seem to have that much impact on what happened).
   The Act has an even simpler input device (a rotating knob, not unlike
   the one from Pong), but the game play is surprisingly subtle.
   Basically, you rotate the knob to control the hero's behavior, and the
   idea is to keep him active without forcing him to go over the top. So
   in the first bit of game play, in which he's flirting with the nurse
   in a Casablanca parody, you've got to turn the knob with a lot of
   finesse--rather slowly, precisely, and sporadically--to avoid scaring
   her off.

   <p>Between the nicely-done animation, unusual premise, and unique game
   play, I found the game pretty absorbing, and was playing when Deb
   arrived. She was intrigued, but when I asked her if she wanted to have
   a go, she said "No!" I should have asked her why, but didn't.

   <p>Back at my folks' house, I looked into the story behind The Act, and
   found that I'd lucked into being one of the first people to play it.
   It's the product of a Boston-area company called Cecropia, and is in a
   test rollout at seven Massachusetts and New Hampshire locations
   through January, including the bowling alley we'd gone to. The
   animation, directed by Broose Johnson, was done by laid-off veterans
   of Disney's Orlando studio, and it's good, funny stuff; even the
   backgrounds are well done.

   <p>(The Cecropia site has more background on the game.)

   <p>The Act has almost nothing to do with the barely-alive industry that
   arcade gaming has become--it's low-key, free of violence other than
   the slapstick kind, and rewards restraint on the part of the game
   player. Most players of arcade games--who seem to be a pretty lonely
   bunch of pre-teen boys these days--probably wouldn't like it; most
   people who might like it probably haven't played an arcade game in
   years.

   <p>I have no idea whether it stands a chance as a business enterprise,
   but I hope so--it's a new idea, and one which makes excellent use of
   hand-drawn animation. If you find yourself near any of the test
   locations in the next few weeks, check it out. And if you don't find
   yourself near them, stay tuned: Apparently, Cecropia has plans to
   release a home version at some point.


   <p>I hope it's a success, one way or another--I'd like to see its makers
   get a shot at continuing this experiment with further games...


   <p>When a major animation figure who was involved with a lot of wonderful
   cartoons dies, is it inappropriate to dwell on the dark side of his
   career? If anyone's reading this, I may find out.

   <p>At MGM in the 1940s, Joe Barbera and Bill Hanna made some of the
   funniest, most expressive, most alive short films--of any sort--ever
   produced anywhere. If they'd left the business when the studio's
   cartoon arm closed in 1957, I'm convinced, their reputation today
   would be pretty simple to summarize: Everyone would know that they
   were grand masters of the American animated short, period.

   <p>But Bill and Joe went on to found their own studio, one whose yearly
   output dwarfed their entire MGM career. And it produced...well, mostly
   cynical crud. (For years, my attitude towards the early Huck Hound and
   Yogi Bear shorts was almost entirely dispassionate, perhaps because we
   got them on Portland TV only when I was about nine and had already
   been soured on HB from watching too much of its later output;
   recently, I've come to appreciate them for their voicework, design,
   and, in some cases, writing. But I'd still rather watch almost any Jay
   Ward cartoon from the same era.)

   <p>From the start, the HB studio's work was derivative--Ruff and Reddy
   being clones of Crusader Rabbit and Rags--and by the mid-1960s, most
   of it was derivative junk without the saving graces of the early
   stuff. HB has been called the studio that saved the animation
   business, but to borrow a phrase from a war of that era, it had to
   destroy the artform in order to save it. I still wonder if TV
   animation would have gotten so bad so quickly if Hanna-Barbera hadn't
   defined schlockiness down a little more each season for so long.

   <p>And it was all doubly depressing because Hanna and Barbera had proved
   themselves capable of making wonderful cartoons. For all we know, Lou
   Scheimer and Norm Prescott were capable only of swill; Bill and Joe
   didn't have that excuse. I remain convinced that they could have done
   better. Even with the budgets they had. Even in an era in which the
   networks made it almost impossible to produce a good TV cartoon.

   <p>(Question: Is it pure coincidence that when HB utterly dominated the
   industry, nearly all television animation was abysmal--and when the
   company's fortunes took a turn for the worse, in the late 1980s or so,
   the quality of the average TV cartoon improved sharply? Discuss...)

   <p>(Another question: If Daws Butler had never lived, would anyone
   remember the earliest HB cartoons with even a small fraction of the
   fondness they generate today?)

   <p>Pardon me--I think I'll go off now and watch The Zoot Cat...


   <p>When I celebrated Friz Freleng's birthday here back in August, I
   really didn't intend to go for close to three months without blogging.
   Actually, I've been blogging up a storm--I've just been doing it over
   at my . But I've neglected this site--mostly
   because things have been busy at work--and feel bad about it.

   <p>I'm resolved to get things rolling again here, and in that spirit,
   I've been working on reviving my MessageCenter, which was crippled by
   spam earlier this year and has been altogether offline for months. I
   have a rough draft of a new version up; it still
   needs some refinement, but feel free to check it out if you have a
   moment. I'll report back here when it's ready for an official grand
   opening.

   <p>And with that, I'm leaving the country on a business trip. But I'll be
   baaaaaaack before long...


 
   <p>As you may know, blogs everywhere are participating in a great Friz
   , in honor of the great man's 100th (maybe)
   birthday. So here's a Friz tribute I wrote a long, long time ago--it
   appared in , which cover-featured Jerry Beck's Friz
   interview, back in 1989. (Amazing in retrospect to think that back
   then, not only was Friz still with us, but I wrote of his career as a
   Warner Bros. director in the present tense.)

   <p>If I was going to write about Freleng today, I might come to different
   conclusions, or discuss them more artfully--or maybe not--but I
   decided to present my essay exactly as I wrote it back in the 20th
   century. In fact, after initially planning to OCR it into ASCII text,
   I decided I liked the scanned image--Times Roman type, crummy
   newsprint, and all (including at least one typo). It reminds me of the
   fun we had desktop-publishing Animato, back in the era when
   communicating with animation fandom required printing up magazines and
   begging comic-book distributors to take them so they could wind up in
   retail stores.

   <p>So here's to you, Friz:



   <p>I haven't had much time lately to work on this site or ,
   although I did just fix (I think) a nagging problem that was hobbling
   the ability to leave comments here.

   <p>But I have a good excuse, and it's not that I haven't been investing
   time in Web stuff. It's just that most of my energy has gone into the
  . We started work on this
   in early 2005; we're still ironing out some kinks, but I'm really
   pleased with it overall.

   <p>Almost everything of note that I bought at this year's San Diego Con
   used to belong to Pete Burness, apparently. Besides the Scrappy art, I
   picked up a promotional booklet for The Bullwinkle Show--Sing Along
   With Bullwinkle Meets Santa Claus:

   <p>For me at least, the whole Jay Ward sensibility has a profoundly Cold
   War-era feel to it, so I was tickled to see this art, with Bullwinkle,
   Boris, and Dudley on a sleigh ride along with JFK, Jackie, Bobby (I
   think), Castro (in back, to the left of Bullwinkle), and Jay Ward
   (Right?). I'm not sure who the dapper guy in the middle with the
   moustache is, though. And I feel I should be able to identify who drew
   this, but I can't.
   <p>Inside are a bunch of satiric Christmas carols that don't mention any
   Jay Ward characters, but do make reference to Caroline and other
   Kennedy kin, the Peace Corps, Green Stamps, the New York Mets, Nielsen
   ratings, the Beverly Hillbillies, Dean Rusk, and other hot topics of
   the early 60s.(From the references to Christmas, JFK, and the
   Hillbillies, I deduce that the booklet dates from 1962--unless, and
   this is sadly possible--it was published for Christmas 1963 and
   released before November 22nd.)
   <p>Here's one page from the interior, with a song by Bill Scott (most of
   the ones in the book are by Allan Burns, and all of them are sort of
   faux-Tom Lehrer):

   I bought one other Ward-related item--yep, also from the Burness
   archive--and I'll try to remember to post it, too.
<p>When it comes to cartoon-related matters, I've always
   had a bizarre knack for being in the right place at the right time.
   But this is silly. I've just learned that the Disney family (and
   specifically Diane Disney Miller and Ron Miller, who are San
   Franciscans these days) intend to build a Walt Disney Family Museum,
   paying tribute to the man--and it's going to be in the Presidio, about
   a mile and a half from my home. (Already, the Presidio has an
   animation connection: It's now the home of Industrial Light and
   Magic.)
   <p>Apparently, the plans have been brewing for awhile now, but I managed
   to miss hearing about 'em. (That would be the third
   comics/animation-related museum in the general area, along with the
  , which is less than a mile from my office, and
   Santa Rosa's , which is an hour's drive away,
   and worth it.)
   <p>There's a whole section at Disney.com on this ,
    has more details and
   says it's all planned for 2008 or 2009. And here's, which says that the Walt Disney Family Foundation
   has been a neighbor of mine since I moved here four years ago. Who
   knew?
   <p>I can't say for sure that I know Walt would be pleased. But I know I
   am...

   <p>I don't know how much original Scrappy production art survives--for
   all I know, Columbia has a vaultful of the stuff--but it's safe to say
   that it's not exactly plentiful on the open market. I do own . In all my time as a
   collector of Scrappyana, though, I've run across only two pieces that
   seem to have been done during production of a cartoon--one of which
   was gone before I found it, and the other of which I was foolish
   enough to let out of my grasp.
   <p>Until this weekend. Within ten minutes of arriving on the floor of the
   dealer's room at the San Diego Con, I was rifling through Scrappy
   drawings. Maybe I've developed some sort of weird Sixth Scrappy Sense.
   <p>True, the seller, who said that they came from Pete Burness's
   collection (did he ever work for Mintz?) also told me they were from
   Willie Whopper cartoons. But I knew better, and now they're mine.
   <p>This one's probably the nicest of the bunch. It looks like a posed
   shot, so it's possible it's for a publicity drawing or somesuch. But
   it sure conveys the flavor of early Scrappy:

   <p>Here's what's pretty clearly an actual Scrappy animation
   drawing--possibly from Sunday Clothes, the third one (I need to check
   my copy):

   <p>And here's what seem to be warmup sketches of Yippy, a bully (or is
   that Scrappy himself in a particularly foul mood?), and a little
   character who I believe is a one-shot Harpo Marx satire, although I'm
   not sure what cartoon he would have appeared in:

   <p>It's been almost a year since my last significant update to
   --but I've begun work on a version 3.0 that'll feature
   these and other recent additions to the archives. Meanwhile, does
   anyone else out there have more information (or informed speculation)
   about these pieces?

   <p>I'm sure there's scads of post-con reporting going on that I'm not
   reading, so I'm not sure if this is common knowledge, but here goes: I
   attended a "talk back" session at the close of the con, and the
   organizers said they're contemplating the possibility of only letting
   pre-registered attendees in on Saturday next year.
   <p>They also said they weren't sure if this would help with crowd issues
   at panels--they felt that it might skew attendance towards dedicated
   fans who were most likely to want to attend lots of panels. And they
   said that one of the biggest challenges with the con has become the
   fact that all the companies involved in the most popular panels are
   insistent that they be held on Saturday--which is at least one reason
   why that day has become the most frustrating, least pleasurable one of
   the convention, at least for me. But it's an intriguing idea...

   <p>This may be--for me, at least--the year that the San Diego Con got too
   big. I haven't heard any word on attendance, but I seem to have spent
   more time than ever more or less trapped in show-floor traffic that's
   just not going anywhere. One panel I wanted to go to--not obviously a
   huge crowd-pleaser--was turning people away by the time I got there;
   the line for the Simpsons panel was so long that it was half over by
   the time I got into the room. I've also been barked at twice by con
   representatives for trying to jump lines when I was simply trying to
   use hallways to get from one place to another.
   <p>Part of the problem, I think, is that this convention isn't about
   anything, other than the vague notion of "a celebration of the popular
   arts." Not being about anything, it's about everything, including
   comics, animation, fantasy movies, horror, science fiction,
   costume-making, toys, role-playing games, computer games, and myriad
   other topics. I didn't see any scheduled events about tattoos, but
   judging from some of the attendees this year, the showing off of
   elaborate tattoos has become another theme of this show.
   Conventions, like magazines, need to be edited. Most of the best
   comics conventions I've ever attended had a clear sensibility at
   work--often that of a single person, such as the old New York cons'
   Phil Seuling, or Don Phelps, the proprietor of some amazing
   <p>conventions in Boston in the 1970s. If there's a sensibility at work
   in the San Diego programming, I can't detect it. And while it may be a
   celebration of the popular arts, it's anything but a celebration of
   excellence--over and over, the programming booklet applies the same
   superlatives to anything and everything. Veronica Mars is memorable.
   Shag has entered the pop culture pantheon. Gumby is magical. David
   Boreanaz is one of TV's biggest stars. A blurb on a session about
   Pokemon season 9 uses two exclamation points (!!). And so on. There's
   no editing going on, and that, I'm sure, is one reason why the con is
   so huge.
   <p>Oh, and would someone inform the management of the San Diego
   Convention Center that convention-center food can consist of more than
   ludicrously overpriced pretzels and cookies served at understaffed
   counters with nowhere to sit? I spend a lot of time in major
   convention centers as part of my day job; I don't know of another
   whose food service is as bad as what we get in this otherwise lovely ,
   highly functional city.
   <p>I'm not sure if there's any way to change San Diego into something
   other than what it's become, and to be fair, the people who run it do
   a mostly good job of crowd control and attendees are generally
   respectful of each other. But this is the first year I've said to
   myself, "Gee, I'm not sure if this'll be worth the hassle next year.
<p>Of course, even a San Diego Con with more than its
   share of hassles also has more than its share of virtues--you just
   need to find the small, focused convention hidden in this mammoth
   enterprise. I've enjoyed hanging out with folks like Jerry Beck, Amid
   Amidi, Bob Miller, Milt Gray, Will Ryan, and others, and meeting ones
   like Craig Yoe and Leslie Carbaga. I've been to some good panels,
   including a Jerry Robinson one hosted by Mark Evanier, an Alex Toth
   tribute, one on Dan DeCarlo (an artist who, I discovered for the first
   time, I admired), and Jerry Beck's Worst Cartoons Ever, which included
   not one but two Sam Singer cartoons I'd never seen. (Some of my
   favorite memories of the convention involve sitting in a huge crowd of
   strangers who were singing, snapping, and clapping along to the theme
   songs to things like Mr. Titan and Super President--who knew that
   terrible cartoons could bring people together?)
   <p>I've picked up some cool stuff, including the new issue of (which is one of the best single issues of an
   animation magazine, ever) and . And did I mention I bought three pieces of
   production artwork from Scappy cartoons? (More on that soon.)
   <p>In short, this trip hasn't been a waste at all. But if you know of any
   smallish, focused, high-quality comics conventions anywhere, lemme
   know about them--I'm not sure what Comic-Con is these days, but it
   isn't a comic con, exactly...
