<h>Debate Begins on Smallpox Vaccination

   <p>The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is expected to make
   recommendations in June on whether Americans should be vaccinated
   against smallpox, a disease that no longer exists on the planet.

   <p>The United States and the rest of the world have been comfortable for
   more than two decades in the knowledge that the last case of smallpox
   occurred in 1977, and the disease was declared completely eradicated
   in 1980. After eliminating stocks of the virus in laboratories
   worldwide, the World Health Organization was able to say in 1984 that
   the only remaining variola virus isolates are stored at just two
   sites: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and
   the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology in
   Novosibirsk, Russia.

   <p>But there are lingering concerns that the virus resides outside those
   laboratories and could be used as a weapon by terrorists. And the
   effects of such a terrorist attack would be catastrophic, say public
   health officials, for two reasons: the virus is highly contagious and
   spreads readily and rapidly from person to person, and almost no one
   in the United States is immune to the infection. Smallpox vaccination
   has not been performed routinely in this country since 1972, so there
   is now a large population of children and young adults who were never
   immunized. And even persons born before 1972, who probably received a
   smallpox vaccination in order to enter school and have the scar to
   prove it, may no longer be immune, since no one knows exactly how long
   vaccination-induced immunity lasts.

   <p>That means almost everyone in the United States would potentially be
   at risk if terrorists introduced the smallpox virus, either by sending
   infected persons to mingle with crowds or by disseminating the virus
   itself in the air or on commonly used objects. That poses questions
   for the Committee on Immunization Practices, including:
     * <l>Should we act now to make smallpox vaccine available to everyone
       in the United States, or, alternatively, to young people between
       the ages of one year and 29 who were never vaccinated; and should
       vaccination be compulsory or voluntary?
     * <l>Or should we wait until there is an attack, relying on the fact
       that immunization within two or three days of exposure seems to
       prevent or lessen the severity of smallpox?

   <p>A number of factors may enter into the committee's decisions. One is
   whether there is enough smallpox vaccine to carry through whatever
   recommendation the committee may come up with. There is currently a
   limited stockpile of vaccine in this country, most of it produced in
   1982 or earlier. In studies published in April in the New England
   Journal of Medicine, researchers reported that they found those
   vaccines can be diluted 5- to 10-fold "without substantial loss of
   efficacy." "When administered by a bifurcated needle to previously
   unvaccinated adults, the vaccine produced vesicular skin lesions that
   correlate with the induction of the antibody and T-cell responses that
   are considered essential for clearing vaccinia virus infections."

   <p>"The current stockpile of 15 million doses of smallpox
       vaccine may safely be diluted to yield at least 75 million doses."

                                                     -- <h>Dr. Anthony Fauci

   <p>That means, says Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of
   Allergy and Infectious Diseases, that "The current stockpile of 15
   million doses of smallpox vaccine may safely be diluted to yield at
   least 75 million doses." In addition, he points out, the ongoing
   production of second-generation smallpox vaccines will increase our
   supply to approximately 286 million doses by the end of this year, and
   the Department of Health and Human Services has said it will test for
   safety and immunogenicity some 75 million doses of vaccine that
   recently were discovered to have been stored by a pharmaceutical
   company since 1972. "Thus, the availability of vaccine will soon
   become less of a factor in the formulation of a policy," Fauci said.

   <p>Another point the advisory committee may consider is how immunization
   on a massive scale might be handled, either before or during a
   terrorist attack. In its successful campaign to eradicate smallpox
   worldwide 40 years ago, the World Health Organization relied on a
   technique called "ring vaccination," which is the approach currently
   recommended in guidelines developed by the Centers for Disease Control
   and Prevention. In ring vaccination, patients with suspected or
   confirmed smallpox are isolated; contacts are traced, vaccinated, and
   kept under close surveillance; and high-risk persons who may have had
   direct or indirect contact with the patient are identified and
   vaccinated.

   <p>"Despite the fundamental soundness of this approach and its success in
   previous naturally occurring outbreaks, there is considerable
   skepticism about the feasibility of this strategy," in the event of a
   terrorist attack, Fauci notes, since multiple exposures and the
   resulting panic could overwhelm the capacity of CDC and local
   authorities to carry out the plan. And most importantly, he points
   out, previous outbreaks that were controlled by ring vaccination were
   in the context of existing herd immunity, not in an essentially
   non-immune population.

   <p>But the factor that seems most likely to affect public opinion about
   the need to vaccinate in advance of an attack, says Dr. William
   Bicknell of the Boston University School of Public Health, is that
   smallpox vaccination often has adverse reactions in otherwise healthy
   persons. Commonly, researchers reported, the healthy young volunteers
   who received either full-strength or dilute vaccine to test its
   efficacy experienced side effects including the formation of satellite
   lesions, regional lymphadenopathy, fever, headache, nausea, muscle
   aches, fatigue, and chills, as well as generalized and local rashes.

    ... <p>"There's no other vaccine that we currently give that
                                        carries with it a risk of death."

                                                           -- <h>Alex Kemper

   <p>In studies reported to the Pediatric Academic Societies annual meeting
   in Baltimore, Maryland, May 7, pediatricians Alex Kemper and Matthew
   Davis of the University of Michigan predicted that a mass campaign to
   vaccinate Americans against smallpox could result in 200 to 300 deaths
   and might make several thousand people severely ill with complications
   such as viral infection spreading from the vaccination site and severe
   skin rashes. "There's no other vaccine that we currently give that
   carries with it a risk of death," Kemper pointed out. "From a societal
   viewpoint, we have to decide whether or not we're willing to take this
   risk."

   <p>But in making its recommendations, the advisory committee is expected
   to weigh the very serious nature of smallpox itself against the
   possibility of adverse reactions to immunization in a limited number
   of people. Most doctors and nurses now in practice have never seen a
   case of smallpox, but a doctor who treated 22 smallpox patients while
   stationed with the military in Japan in 1945 described the experience
   in a New England Journal of Medicine article. "The disease began with
   a high fever," Dr. Murray Dworetzky recalled, "with the temperature
   exceeding 40 degrees Centigrade and then dropping, although never to
   normal, before it spiked again. Although some patients had pustular
   lesions, those who died had confluent subcutaneous hemorrhages that
   rapidly involved the entire body, with a similar enanthema involving
   the mucous membrances of the oral cavity, respiratory mucosa, and
   entire gastrointestinal tract. The pain was intense and morphine
   relieved it only marginally." Fourteen of the 22 patients died.

   <p>Another New England Journal article notes that the incubation period
   for the disease is 7 to 17 days, after which severe backache,
   headache, and fever begin abruptly. Lesions occur first on the face
   and extremities but then cover the entire body. After severe smallpox,
   pockmarks or pitted lesions are seen in 65 to 80 percent of survivors,
   most commonly on the face. Death from smallpox is ascribed to toxemia,
   associated with immune complexes, and to hypotension.

   <p>In any case, the New England Journal of Medicine editorializes, "The
   debate on preemptive vaccination cannot go on indefinitely. We need to
   make a decision. If we do proceed with large-scale vaccination, we
   need to consider what operational plans might be workable, who should
   be immunized, when they should be immunized, and how to reduce
   unintended sequelae."
