   <p>They don't talk about it on TV anymore, but someone tried to make
   money with unusual stock trades right before the terrorist attacks of
   September 11.  Who knew to bet that United Airlines would lose money?

   <h>Suppressed Details of Criminal Insider Trading Lead Directly into the
                            CIA's Highest Ranks
     <h>CIA Executive Director "Buzzy" Krongard managed firm that handled
                  "PUT" options on United Airline Stock  
                          by Michael C. Ruppert  

   <p>FTW - October 9, 2001 - Although uniformly ignored by the mainstream
   U.S. media, there is abundant and clear evidence that a number of
   transactions in financial markets indicated specific (criminal)
   foreknowledge of the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center
   and the Pentagon. In the case of at least one of these trades -- which
   has left a $2.5 million prize unclaimed -- the firm used to place the
   "put options" on United Airlines stock was, until 1998, managed by the
   man who is now in the number three Executive Director position at the
   Central Intelligence Agency.

   <p>Until 1997 A.B. "Buzzy" Krongard had been Chairman of the investment
   bank A.B. Brown. A.B. Brown was acquired by Banker's Trust in 1997.
   Krongard then became, as part of the merger, Vice Chairman of Banker's
   Trust-AB Brown, one of 20 major U.S. banks named by Senator Carl Levin
   this year as being connected to money laundering. Krongard's last
   position at Banker's Trust (BT) was to oversee "private client
   relations." In this capacity he had direct hands-on relations with
   some of the wealthiest people in the world in a kind of specialized
   banking operation that has been identified by the U.S. Senate and
   other investigators as being closely connected to the laundering of
   drug money.

   <p>Krongard joined the CIA in 1998 as counsel to CIA Director George
   Tenet. He was promoted to CIA Executive Director by President Bush in
   March of this year. BT was acquired by Deutsche Bank in 1999. The
   combined firm is the single largest bank in Europe.  And, as we shall
   see, Deutsche Bank played several key roles in events connected to the
   September 11 attacks.

   <h>THE SCOPE OF KNOWN INSIDER TRADING 

   <p>Before looking further into these relationships it is necessary to
   look at the insider trading information that is being ignored by
   Reuters, The New York Times and other mass media. It is well
   documented that the CIA has long monitored such trades - in real time
   - as potential warnings of terrorist attacks and other economic moves
   contrary to U.S. interests. Previous stories in FTW have specifically
   highlighted the use of Promis software to monitor such trades.

   <p>It is necessary to understand only two key financial terms to
   understand the significance of these trades, "selling short" and "put
   options".

  <p> "Selling Short" is the borrowing of stock, selling it at current
   market prices, but not being required to actually produce the stock
   for some time. If the stock falls precipitously after the short
   contract is entered, the seller can then fulfill the contract by
   buying the stock after the price has fallen and complete the contract
   at the pre-crash price. These contracts often have a window of as long
   as four months.

   <p>"Put Options," are contracts giving the buyer the option to sell
   stocks at a later date. Purchased at nominal prices of, for example,
   $1.00 per share, they are sold in blocks of 100 shares. If exercised,
   they give the holder the option of selling selected stocks at a future
   date at a price set when the contract is issued. Thus, for an
   investment of $10,000 it might be possible to tie up 10,000 shares of
   United or American Airlines at $100 per share, and the seller of the
   option is then obligated to buy them if the option is executed. If the
   stock has fallen to $50 when the contract matures, the holder of the
   option can purchase the shares for $50 and immediately sell them for
   $100 - regardless of where the market then stands. A call option is
   the reverse of a put option, which is, in effect, a derivatives bet
   that the stock price will go up.

     <p>A September 21 story by the Israeli Herzliyya International Policy
   Institute for Counterterrorism, entitled "Black Tuesday: The World's
   Largest Insider Trading Scam?" documented the following trades
   connected to the September 11 attacks:

      -        <p>Between September 6 and 7, the Chicago Board Options
     Exchange saw purchases of 4,744 put options on United Airlines, but
     only 396 call options... Assuming that 4,000 of the options were
     bought by people with advance knowledge of the imminent attacks,
     these "insiders" would have profited by almost $5 million.

   -        <p>On September 10, 4,516 put options on American Airlines were
   bought on the Chicago exchange, compared to only 748 calls. Again,
   there was no news at that point to justify this imbalance;... Again,
   assuming that 4,000 of these options trades represent "insiders," they
   would represent a gain of about $4 million.

   -        <p>[The levels of put options purchased above were more than six
   times higher than normal.]

   -        <p>No similar trading in other airlines occurred on the Chicago
   exchange in the days immediately preceding Black Tuesday. 

   -        <p>Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., which occupied 22 floors of
   the World Trade Center, saw 2,157 of its October $45 put options
   bought in the three trading days before Black Tuesday; this compares
   to an average of 27 contracts per day before September 6. Morgan
   Stanley's share price fell from $48.90 to $42.50 in the aftermath of
   the attacks. Assuming that 2,000 of these options contracts were
   bought based upon knowledge of the approaching attacks, their
   purchasers could have profited by at least $1.2 million. Merrill Lynch
   & Co., with headquarters near the Twin Towers, saw 12,215 October $45
   put options bought in the four trading days before the attacks; the
   previous average volume in those shares had been 252 contracts per day
   [a 1200% increase!]. When trading resumed, Merrill's shares fell from
   $46.88 to $41.50; assuming that 11,000 option contracts were bought by
   "insiders," their profit would have been about $5.5 million.

   -        <p>European regulators are examining trades in Germany's Munich
   Re, Switzerland's Swiss Re, and AXA of France, all major reinsurers
   with exposure to the Black Tuesday disaster. [FTW Note: AXA also owns
   more than 25% of American Airlines stock making the attacks a "double
   whammy" for them.]
   On September 29, 2001 - in a vital story that has gone unnoticed by
   the major media - the San Francisco Chronicle reported, "Investors
   have yet to collect more than $2.5 million in profits they made
   trading options in the stock of United Airlines before the Sept. 11,
   terrorist attacks, according to a source familiar with the trades and
   market data. 

   <p>"The uncollected money raises suspicions that the investors - whose
   identities and nationalities have not been made public - had advance
   knowledge of the strikes." They don't dare show up now. The suspension
   of trading for four days after the attacks made it impossible to
   cash-out quickly and claim the prize before investigators started
   looking.

   <p>"... October series options for UAL Corp. were purchased in highly
   unusual volumes three trading days before the terrorist attacks for a
   total outlay of $2,070; investors bought the option contracts, each
   representing 100 shares, for 90 cents each. [This represents 230,000
   shares]. Those options are now selling at more than $12 each. There
   are still 2,313 so-called "put" options outstanding [valued at $2.77
   million and representing 231,300 shares] according to the Options
   Clearinghouse Corp." 

   <p>"...The source familiar with the United trades identified Deutsche
   Bank Alex. Brown, the American investment banking arm of German giant
   Deutsche Bank, as the investment bank used to purchase at least some
   of these options..." This was the operation managed by Krongard until
   as recently as 1998. 

   <p>As reported in other news stories, Deutsche Bank was also the hub of
   insider trading activity connected to Munich Re. just before the
   attacks.

   <h>CIA, THE BANKS AND THE BROKERS 

   <p>Understanding the interrelationships between CIA and the banking and
   brokerage world is critical to grasping the already frightening
   implications of the above revelations. Let's look at the history of
   CIA, Wall Street and the big banks by looking at some of the key
   players in CIA's history.

   <p>Clark Clifford - The National Security Act of 1947 was written by
   Clark Clifford, a Democratic Party powerhouse, former Secretary of
   Defense, and one-time advisor to President Harry Truman. In the 1980s,
   as Chairman of First American Bancshares, Clifford was instrumental in
   getting the corrupt CIA drug bank BCCI a license to operate on
   American shores. His profession: Wall Street lawyer and banker.

   <p>John Foster and Allen Dulles - These two brothers "designed" the CIA
   for Clifford. Both were active in intelligence operations during WW
   II. Allen Dulles was the U.S. Ambassador to Switzerland where he met
   frequently with Nazi leaders and looked after U.S. investments in
   Germany. John Foster went on to become Secretary of State under Dwight
   Eisenhower and Allen went on to serve as CIA Director under Eisenhower
   and was later fired by JFK. Their professions: partners in the most
   powerful - to this day - Wall Street law firm of Sullivan, Cromwell.

   <p>Bill Casey - Ronald Reagan's CIA Director and OSS veteran who served
   as chief wrangler during the Iran-Contra years was, under President
   Richard Nixon, Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. His
   profession: Wall Street lawyer and stockbroker.

   <p>David Doherty - The current Vice President of the New York Stock
   Exchange for enforcement is the retired General Counsel of the Central
   Intelligence Agency.

   <p>George Herbert Walker Bush - President from 1989 to January 1993, also
   served as CIA Director for 13 months from 1976-7. He is now a paid
   consultant to the Carlyle Group, the 11^th largest defense contractor
   in the nation, which also shares joint investments with the bin Laden
   family.

   <p>A.B. "Buzzy" Krongard - The current Executive Director of the Central
   Intelligence Agency is the former Chairman of the investment bank A.B.
   Brown and former Vice Chairman of Banker's Trust.

   <p>John Deutch - This retired CIA Director from the Clinton
   Administration currently sits on the board at Citigroup, the nation's
   second largest bank, which has been repeatedly and overtly involved in
   the documented laundering of drug money. This includes Citigroup's
   2001 purchase of a Mexican bank known to launder drug money, Banamex.

   <p>Nora Slatkin - This retired CIA Executive Director also sits on
   Citibank's board.

   <p>Maurice "Hank" Greenburg - The CEO of AIG insurance, manager of the
   third largest capital investment pool in the world, was floated as a
   possible CIA Director in 1995. FTW exposed Greenberg's and AIG's long
   connection to CIA drug trafficking and covert operations in a two-part
   series that was interrupted just prior to the attacks of September 11.
   AIG's stock has bounced back remarkably well since the attacks. To
   read that story, please go to
   http://www.copvcia.com/stories/part_2.html.


   <p>One wonders how much damning evidence is necessary to respond to what
   is now irrefutable proof that CIA knew about the attacks and did not
   stop them. Whatever our government is doing, whatever the CIA is
   doing, it is clearly NOT in the interests of the American people,
   especially those who died on September 11.
