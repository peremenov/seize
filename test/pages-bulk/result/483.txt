   <h>VINYL TO GO!

   <h>David Price points the cheapest way to high-quality vinyl replay.

   <p>People who've grown up with CD could be forgiven for not wanting toget
   into vinyl. After all, isn't it the preserve of snobbish,
   backward-lookingold fogeys, with more money than sense? Well, no.
   There are still plentyof affordable, sub-£500 turntables on sale that
   will eat most CDplayers for breakfast.

   <p>Despite their clicks, pops and dirty styli, they'll give you more
   passion,more life, more music than any silver-disc spinner. So we
   thought we'dgive you a Get Going In Vinyl guide, a no-nonsense look at
   the best budgetvinyl hardware. Go on, get yourself a turntable, you
   know you want to!

   <h>TURNTABLES
   ______________________________________________________________________

   <h>PRO-JECT .5 £159
   <p>Verymuch a starter turntable, the Project .5
   comes complete with an OrtofonOM10 Moving Magnet cartridge (worth £30)
   and basic automation - thedeck starts revolving when you move the
   tone-arm over the record. Althougha touch rough around the edges, the
   Pro-ject manages an enjoyably musicalperformance and represents
   excellent value for vinyl virgins.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   <h>PRO-JECT 1 £199
   <p>Aproper hi-fi deck, the 1 is completely devoid of
   facilities, preferringto put the emphasis on sound. Features include a
   precision bearing supportinga dynamically-balanced alloy platter and a
   good basic arm with adjustableheight - an unusual but highly
   worthwhile feature. The sound is fast andpunchy, with more life and
   sparkle than its more expensive Rega rival.Factor in the fitted
   Ortofon 510 cartridge and it's a tempting proposition.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   <h>REGA PLANAR 2 £214
   <p>Despitefierce competition from Pro-ject, this
   evergreen remains highly competitive.Cunningly simple, it consists of
   a black fibreboard plinth into which adecent motor and bearing are
   set, with a thin glass platter and felt maton top. The RB250 arm is a
   remarkably polished performer for the moneywith decent bearings and a
   quality, one-piece cast arm tube.

   <p>A refined and musical design, the Planar 2 sounds more mature than
   thePro-ject 1 but lacks a little of its brio. By absolute standards
   the 2'srather limited at frequency extremes and has mediocre speed
   stability butyou'd be surprised at how good it can still sound. The 2
   has also appearedslightly modified under Akai and NAD 533 guises.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   <h>REGA PLANAR 3 £274
   <p>grown-up version of the Planar 2, this classic
   deck has sold in vast quantitiessince its inception way back in 1978.
   Although it gets an improved plinth,platter and bearing, its most
   distinguishing feature is the RB300 arm -a budget classic if ever
   there was one. Given a good cartridge and propersiting on a
   vibration-free support, the Planar 3 will embarrass many farmore
   expensive CD players. Its civilised yet musical performance is softand
   subtle yet detailed and engaging.

   <p>Although bettered by slightly more expensive separate
   turntable/armcombinations, as a 'plug in and play' solution it's
   superb. And it's alsothe only turntable available in purple - an extra
   £15 buys you achoice of seven pretty colours!
   ______________________________________________________________________

   <h>PRO-JECT 2  £299
   <p>Asouped-up Pro-ject 1, the 2 has an improved alloy,
   glass and felt platterand a standard record clamp - usually the
   province of high-end Michellsand SMEs. The tone-arm also gets a few
   mods, but it still can't reallymatch the Rega RB300.

   <p>The sound gains refinement and poise, sounding faster, cleaner and
   betterfocused, making the deck a truly enjoyable listen. The cartridge
   is improvedtoo, with either an Ortofon 520 or an MC1 moving coil for
   those with suitablephono stages. A lot of turntable for very little
   money.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   <h>MICHELL MYCRO £435
   <p>Anunconventional design, the Mycro is basically
   a paired-down GyroDec, itselfone of the best sub-£1000 turntables.
   Hand-built from the best materials,it features a sprung sub-chassis on
   which sits a superb inverted bearingand heavy acrylic platter, driven
   by a long rubber belt from a low-noisemotor. The base is also acrylic,
   chosen for its excellent resonance dampingproperties as much as its
   striking looks. Numerous armboards are availablebut the Mycro usually
   comes with the ubiquitous Rega for £577.

   <p>Sound is very solid, detailed and open with particularly strong
   stereoimaging. Bass is deep and controlled, if a little dry. Although
   more cerebralsounding than most, the Mycro is a truly accomplished
   budget design andlooks superb to boot.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   <h>PRO-JECT 6  £459
   <p>Thisis value - a three-point suspended sub-chassis
   deck with a decent arm andgroove-tastic Ortofon MC15 Super 2 moving
   coil for under £500! It'salso hard to argue with its alloy and glass
   platter, silicon arm dampingand highly adjustable suspension. Sound is
   strong and musically confident,with real bass and smooth treble - a
   major step up from the Rega class.

   <p>The Project isn't quite up there with the Michell and Systemdek,
   butthen it's far cheaper when you remember you need an arm and
   cartridge forthe latter pair. This is the one to go for if you want a
   top notch, fuss-freeturntable package.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   <h>ROKSAN RADIUS £470
   <p>Anunusual but attractive deck, the Radius brings
   some exotic features tothe budget end of the market. An
   independently-sprung sub-chassis doesa good job of isolating the deck
   from its surroundings, while a decentbearing, motor and belt drive
   give a stable ride for the record.

   <p>The Radius comes without an arm, but when partnered with Roksan's
   excellent£320 Tabriz it gives an impressively fast and dynamic sound.
   Bestused with warm ancillaries, this deck is for those who prefer
   power andinvolvement to subtlety and warmth.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   <h>SYSTEMDEK 2X2 £500
   <p>The2X2 straddles the gap between budget and
   high end. Its independently sprungsub-chassis offers near immunity to
   acoustic feedback, while the expensiveacrylic platter is a superb way
   to support records. Although usually soldwith the Rega RB300 arm,
   various armboards are available and the 2X2 isquite capable of
   accepting arm designs costing twice its price.

   <p>Sonically it's one of the best affordable turntables - clean and
   detailedyet highly musical and dynamic. Bass isn't particularly deep
   but it's fastand fluent, and the upper midrange and treble are
   pin-sharp - for the moneyit's little short of a bargain.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   <h>CARTRIDGES
   ______________________________________________________________________

   <h>ORTOFON OM10 £29.95
   <p>Aquality budget cartridge with a smooth, refined,
   if slightly bass-lightsound. Stylus can be easily upgraded to OM20
   status, bringing bags of extradetail and polish.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   <h>GOLDRING 1042 £120
   <p>Beautifullydeep, dark, rich analogue sound goes
   down a treat in Regas and super-decksalike. Secure tracking makes for
   excellent detail and poise.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   <h>PHONO STAGES
   ______________________________________________________________________

   <h>QED DISCSAVER £35
   <p>Cheapand cheerful starter powered by a mains adapter
   or direct from a PP3 battery- the latter brings a smoother, cleaner
   sound. Either way it's a fast,rhythmic performer that will extract
   plenty of music from inexpensive turntablesand cartridges.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   <h>ROTEL RQ-970BX £129
   <p>Thecheapest serious design, this full-width black
   box offers a fast and musicalsound with a surprising amount of detail
   - for not much money. Also hasa good moving coil input.
   ______________________________________________________________________

   <h>LFD MISTRAL PHONO STAGE £300
   <p>TheMistral is a super device with a rich, detailed and
   rhythmic sound thatmakes it the best at the price. It's also an
   excellent upgrade to virtuallyany integrated amp's internal phono
   stage, although the switchable MovingCoil stage can be a bit on the
   hissy side.
