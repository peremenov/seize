   <h>Science of Speech

   <h>From The Mahabharata
   <h>Santi Parva, Section CCCXXI
   <h>Translated by Sri Kisari Mohan Ganguli

   <p>An extract from the dialogue between King Janaka, the ruler of the
   Videha and a woman of the name of Sulabha, belonging to the mendicant
   order.

   <p>Sulabha said: O king, speech ought always to be free from the nine
   verbal faults and the nine faults of judgment. It should also, while
   setting forth the meaning with perspicuity, be possessed of the
   eighteen well-known merits.

   <p>Ambiguity, ascertainment of the faults and merits of premises and
   conclusions, the conclusion, and the element of persuasiveness or
   otherwise that attaches to the conclusion thus arrived at- these five
   characteristics appertaining to the sense- constitute the
   authoritativeness of what is said. Listen now o the characteristics of
   these requirements beginning with ambiguity, one after another, as I
   expound them according to the combinations.

   <p>When knowledge rests on distinction in consequence of the object to be
   known being different from one another, and when (as regards the
   comprehension of the subject) the understanding rests upon many
   points, one after another, the combination of words (in whose case
   this occurs) is said to be vitiated by ambiguity. By ascertainment (of
   faults and merits), called Sankhya, is meant the establishment, by
   elimination, of faults or merits (in premises and conclusions),
   adopting tentative meanings. Krama or weighing the relative strength
   or weakness of the faults or merits (ascertained by the above process)
   consists in settling the propriety of the priority or subsequence of
   the words employed in a sentence. This is the meaning attached to the
   word `Krama' by persons conversant with the interpretation of
   sentences or texts. By conclusion is meant the final determination,
   after this examination of what has been said on the subjects of
   religion, pleasure, wealth, and Emancipation, in respect of what is
   particularly is that has been said in the text. The sorrow born of
   wish or aversion increases to a great measure. The conduct, O king,
   that one pursues in such a matter (for dispelling the sorrow
   experienced) is called Prayojanam.

   <p>[Note: By `prayojanam' is meant the conduct one pursues for gratifying
   one's wish to acquire or avoid any object. Wish in respect of either
   acquisition or avoidance, if ungratified, becomes a source of pain.
   The section or conduct that one adopts for removing that pain is
   called Prayojanam. In the Gautama-sutras it is said that
   `yamarthamadhikritya pravartate, tat prayojanam.' The two definitions
   are identical.]

   <p>Take it for certain, O king, at my word, that these characteristics of
   Ambiguity and the other (numbering five in all), when occurring
   together, constitute a complete and intelligible sentence.

   <p>[Note: By occurrence of these five characteristics together is meant
   that when these are properly attended to by a speaker or writer, only
   then can his sentence be said to be complete and intelligible. In
   Nyaya, the five requisites are Pratijna, Hetu, Udaharana, Upanaya, and
   Nigamana. In the Mimansa philosophy, the five requisites have been
   named differently. Vishaya, Samsaya, Purvapaksha, Uttara, and
   Nirnaya.]

   <p>The words I shall utter will be fraught with sense, free from
   ambiguity (in consequence of each of them not being symbols of many
   things), logical, free from pleonasm or tautology, smooth, certain,
   free from bombast, agreeable or sweet, truthful, inconsistent with the
   aggregate of three, (viz., Righteousness, Wealth, and Pleasure),
   refined (i.e., free from Prakriti), not elliptical or imperfect,
   destitute of harshness or difficulty of comprehension, characterized
   by due order, not far fetched in respect of sense, corrected with one
   another as cause and effect and each having a specific object.

   <p>[Note: These characteristics, though numbering sixteen, include the
   four and twenty mentioned by Bhojadeva in his Rhetoric called
   `Saraswati-kanthabharana.]

   <p>I shall not tell thee anything, prompted by desire or wrath or fear or
   cupidity or abjectness or deceit or shame or compassion or pride. (I
   answer thee because it is proper for me to answer what thou hast
   said). When the speaker, the hearer, and the words said, thoroughly
   agree with one another in course of a speech, then does the sense or
   meaning come out very clearly. When, in the matter of what is to be
   said, the speaker shows disregard for the understanding of the hearer
   by uttering words whose meaning is understood by himself, then,
   however good those words may be, they become incapable of being seized
   by the hearer.

   <p>That speaker, again, who, abandoning all regard for his own meaning
   uses words that are of excellent sound and sense, awakens only
   erroneous impressions in the mind of the hearer. Such words in such
   connection become certainly faulty. That speaker, however, who employs
   words that are, while expressing his own meaning, intelligible to the
   hearer, as well, truly deserves to be called a speaker. No other man
   deserves the name. It behoveth thee, therefore, O king, to hear with
   concentrated attention these words of mine, fraught with meaning and
   endued with wealth of vocables.
