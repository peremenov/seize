<h>If You Lie Down with Dogs, You Wake Up with Fleas... or a Baby by Maegan "la

   <h>If You Lie Down with Dogs, You Wake Up with Fleas... or a Baby
   <h>by Maegan "la Mala" Ortiz
   <p>My mind has been reeling since yesterday.
   I don't enjoy being single and being your sometime lover. You and I
   have been at this for over a year, and the novelty of it is wearing
   thin. Don't get me wrong, amor, my stomach still feels all bubbly when
   I see your screen name pop up on my computer screen, or when
   "Beautiful" by Snoop plays on my phone reminding me of a night last
   summer when you and I danced to that song in one of many Williamsburg
   hipster bars we've been to together. Like today when you called. I was
   sitting at my computer sending out a Spanish-language flyer for the
   upcoming parent's association meeting at my daughter's school when my
   cell phone rang and I smiled. I knew you were calling to schedule a
   booty call, or maybe even to give me work translating for you at a
   closing.
   <p>We exchange polite greetings and engage in worthless banter for a bit.
   I ask if youâre over your jetlag since youâd instant messaged me
   earlier that youâd been in Los Angeles meeting with a client. I tell
   you again how sorry I am you had a horrible time while you were there.
   You said Los Angeles was soulless and I made a joke about how I
   thought you liked your cities like your women-- soulless. I'll be
   honest with you: Iâm glad you had a bad trip, not because I wish you
   harm, but because California has already seduced two of my former
   lovers. But I wasn't ready for the real reason your business trip was
   bad.
   <p>"It was what happened before the trip that ruined it," you say
   seriously. I expected a story about your alcoholic father back home in
   Connecticut. "Do you remember the Argentinean girl?"
   <p>How could I not remember the Argentinean girl? Iâve never met her, I
   can't even tell you her name, but I know her. I met her early on in
   our relationship. Many a morning after, while searching for a
   carelessly tossed thong, I met the fuzzy slippers she left underneath
   your bed. I met her lotions, body washes, shampoos and even tampons
   during my after-sex showers. I still meet her when I don't see your
   screen name online, and when your cell phone goes straight to
   voicemail when I call. I meet her in your absence. Once she asked you
   to stop sleeping with other people so you and I didn't speak for a few
   months. But you always come back.
   <p>"She's pregnant," you say.
   <p>I stayed silent on the phone for a few seconds digesting the
   conflicting emotions I swallowed when those words escaped your mouth.
   I pictured you with her and I don't even know what she looks like. In
   my head she looks like an Argentinean stripper I used to work with.
   She was beautiful and arrogant with her bleached hair and fake
   breasts, breasts she would shield from certain spotlights lest the
   scars show. The image of you entering her is enough to make me feel
   nauseous. I then think of the week my period was a few days late and I
   nursed dreams of carrying your baby. But I only seem to get pregnant
   when men want to leave me.
   <p>You obviously aren't ready to leave me so I ask a stupid question, "Is
   it yours?"
   <p>You tell me you're not sure since she slept with one other man that
   you know of in the same time period.
   <p>"So what are you going to do?" I ask. I ask what you are going to do.
   I don't ask what she is going to do.
   <p>You tell me that you told her it was a good idea to terminate the
   pregnancy. She told you she wanted to have the baby. Of course you
   tell her to have an abortion and of course she says she wants the
   baby. Every man who has gotten me pregnant has recited the same words.
   It's as if you all work from the same script. We, as women, are
   compelled to defend ourselves if not the baby, if we even consider it
   a baby. Even if we want the abortion, chances are we won't tell you
   that. It's sad, but when a relationship is already tripping on itself
   a pregnancy becomes a manipulation tool.
   <p>"Besides the doctors don't think she should have the baby because of
   her health problems," you continue.
   <p>I begin to feel bad for the Argentinean girl. "What does she have?" I
   ask, concerned now.
   <p>You tell me about how her father got her pregnant when she was
   fourteen and how she had a back alley abortion that did serious
   damage.
   <p>"Did you say her father?" I ask, not believing what Iâd heard, or
   maybe I didn't want to feel sorry for her.
   <p>You tell me yes her father and continue, without pausing to take a
   breath, telling me how she also "claims" to have had ovarian cancer,
   and now only has one ovary. "But I haven't seen any scars or medical
   records to substantiate that," you finish.
   <p>"Why would any woman lie about any of that?" I ask you defensively. I
   am feeling sorry for her. "So what are you going to do?" I ask again
   because you haven't answered my question.
   <p>"She's mad at me because I'm not happy and didn't ask her to marry
   me," you continue and my stomach starts to churn again at the word
   marry. "But I can't be by her side during this pregnancy not knowing
   if the baby is mine." You pause. "Mala, can I ask you something?"
   I tell you of course you can, as if at this point your asking matters.
   Iâm dazed by the information that is coming at me and I feel unable to
   process it all. Iâm confused as to why you would choose to open
   yourself up to me about such a thing. Iâm under no illusion that itâs
   because you think Iâm a wonderful trustworthy woman.
   <p>"You did it. It really wasn't that hard going through a pregnancy by
   yourself, was it?"
   <p>I laugh at the absurdity of your question. You were asking me to give
   you permission to turn your back on your pregnant lover. I was
   incapable of being a bitch, of lying and saying it was a breeze, that
   she could handle it fine.
   <p>"It sucked,â I spew. âIt sucks going to ob-gyn appointments alone and
   watching nearly everyone else's husband or partner at least pick them
   up. It sucks being scared and having no one to hold your hand. It
   sucks having no one to share the joy with. No, it wasn't easy and I
   had the support of family and friends." I tell you this angrily. And I
   don't have to tell you how it sucked being a single mother. My
   alternate suddenly won't have a flat stomach. That stomach will bear
   ocean ripples of stretch marks like my own. Scheduling trysts with her
   will become just as complicated as scheduling them with me, having to
   work around bedtimes and babysitting availability.
   <p>"So what are you going to do?" I ask a third time. I want to know if
   this means you don't want to see me anymore. I want to know if this is
   the beginning of another one of your departures. I want to know if
   youâre planning to play house.
   <p>"Want to hear something surreal that happened to me today?" you ask. I
   think youâre going to change the subject, which I would be grateful
   for. This conversation was surreal enough for me.
   <p>You start, "I was at the diner getting breakfast the other morning--"
   <p>"Kelloggâs?" I interrupt to ask. The diner has a convenience store in
   the front. I am trying to imagine you in your suit, ordering your
   oatmeal as you have a few morning afters with me.
   <p>"Yes," you continue. "And this drug addict in rags comes up to me. She
   doesn't ask me for money, she doesn't even ask me for food. She asks
   me to buy a package of diapers for her baby. She calls me an angel and
   I stop her, telling her Iâm no angel for buying her as many diapers as
   she can carry because Iâve decided to turn my back on my own
   drug-addicted lover who may be carrying my baby."
   <p>Maybe you wanted me to feel sorry for you, and part of me did. Part of
   me felt sorry for her. I felt sorry for myself, but what I picked up
   on was your mention of the Argentineanâs substance abuse problem.
   <p>"What is she using again?" I ask.
   <p>You've confused me on this topic before. As ugly and immature as I
   think it looks for you, a thirty-two year old attorney, to sit in his
   living room smoking weed, I tolerate it. Once when we were in bed
   together you told me that she, the Argentinean, had stopped talking to
   you over some bad cocaine you had gotten her. You later took it back
   saying you were just joking. I have never seen any evidence of you
   using anything beyond marijuana.
   <p>"This is one of the things that bugs me, the timing of it all," you
   say." A few weeks ago after walking her dog and finding a condom in
   its ass--"
   <p>I interrupt you to laugh at what I think is another one of your crude
   jokes that you often interject into serious moments.
   <p>"I'm serious," you say firmly. "So after that I had a discussion with
   her and basically gave her an ultimatum telling her that if I see even
   one track mark on her arm, itâs over."
   <p>"So wait a minute. You've been sleeping with her, having unprotected
   sex while she's shooting up heroin, and at the same time you're having
   unprotected sex with me?" I ask.
   <p>You answer in the affirmative and I shudder. I begin looking for my
   wallet so I can pull out my health insurance card and schedule an
   appointment for a series of blood tests. You must have been reading my
   mind because you tell me that you got tested for everything just two
   weeks ago and that everything came out clean. I think that was
   supposed to make me feel better. It didn't.
   <p>"But anyway,â you persist, âIt was soon after that ultimatum that she
   tells me she's pregnant so it makes me wonder if she's doing this so I
   don't abandon her."
   <p>I know you won't abandon her. You confided in me once that you were in
   love with this woman. You haven't abandoned me, even though many times
   Iâve wished you would. It would be easier that way. That way I could
   just hate you.
   <p>"Sometimes after sex it seemed as if she was trying to purposely grab
   up some of my juice to get herself pregnant."
   <p>"You think she did all this on purpose?" I ask. Iâm embarrassed as I
   think about how the very thought has crossed my mind, to climb on top
   of you after having sex, after you cum on my back or stomach.
   "I told her to get on birth control, but she says it's too expensive,"
   you say.
   <p>"She can go to Planned Parenthood," I say, surprised at the fact that
   Iâm telling you how to get your other lover inexpensive, maybe even
   free, birth control. But it seems a little too late anyway.
   <p>"Hell, because she's a drug addict people will tie her fucking tubes
   for free, but she doesn't want to admit she's an addict," you say,
   disgust in your voice.
   <p>I want to tell you about how I am opposed to such programs, but the
   hole in my stomach swallows up my good politics.
   <p>"So what are you going to do?" I ask a fourth time because I am tired
   of hearing so much background information about her, the other. "I
   have so much I want to say to you now, but Iâm holding my tongue," I
   finally admit. âItâs barely 11:30 in the morning and I'm drinking."
   <p>You find that funny and laugh before telling me you want to hear what
   I have to say. I don't remember you ever saying that to me before.
   <p>"I just don't understand you," I begin. "I try to keep emotional
   distance from you so that when something like this happens I can walk
   away unharmed, but I care about you and you know it and it frustrates
   me to see you, an intelligent man, engaging in such risky behavior,
   acting like an adolescent, and I don't understand how you could want
   all this fucking drama with a fucking drug addict and keep me in the
   dark and on the side. I don't understand why you always choose her
   over me!" I hold back my tears and wait for your reaction.
   <p>"So I was thinking that since you need work, if in nine months youâre
   still in the same situation, maybe you could help the Argentinean out
   or maybe you guys could do a babysitting exchange."
   <p>I want to curse you out. I want to tell you, "Fuck you and your baby!"
   but instead I just call you an asshole. I do not, however, end the
   call.
   <p>"Ay, come on! You won't even occasionally pick the kid up from the
   physical therapy he no doubt will need because he'll be born addicted
   to drugs?" You laugh at your own sick joke.
   <p>Now I am going to end the conversation, but conveniently your other
   line rings. You say it's the office and quickly hang up, promising to
   call me back later.
   With you off the phone, I cry. I laugh at myself. I scream at myself.
   I pour myself another rum and ginger ale and start searching for any
   hidden cigarettes. I drink and smoke and of course you never call me
   back.
   <p>A few hours later we meet again the same way we met the first time,
   online. For some strange reason, I feel guilty for not being a better
   friend to you and I instant message you to apologize.
   "When you confided in me, I reacted as your lover, not as your friend,
   and obviously you needed a friend," I typed.
   <p>You apologized for opening up your "stupid mouth." Of course I told
   you that you had nothing to apologize for, that I wanted you to
   confide in me, that I valued our friendship as much as I valued the
   incredible sex.
   <p>"Nothing has changed between us," I wrote. That statement is truer
   than we would both care to admit.
   <p>You then tell me the Argentinean has decided to get a procedure. As I
   suspected, the office hadn't been the real reason you'd hung up the
   phone so quickly earlier.
   <p>"The procedure?" I ask.
   <p>"Yes," you type.
   <p>I think her decision and your telling me about it was supposed to make
   both of us feel better. I can't speak for you, but I still feel sick
   to my stomach, and I still want to see you tomorrow after class.
