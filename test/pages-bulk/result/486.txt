<h>Committee Reports

<h>Committee on Affiliated Societies

   <p>At its January 2002 meeting, the AHA Council accepted--on the
   recommendation of the Committee on Affiliated Societies--the German
   Historical Institute's application for affiliation. During the year
   the committee recommended two new organizations for affiliations. The
   first was the Society of Automotive Historians (SAH), a society that
   encourages research, documentation, preservation, and publication of
   history concerning the invention, development, and influence of the
   automobile. Founded in 1969, the SAH foster connections and
   cooperation through meetings, a membership directory, bimonthly
   newsletters, and a semi-annual scholarly journal, Automotive History
   Review.

   <p>The second was the Center for History and New Media (CHNM), located at
   George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. Since 1994, the Center
   combines innovative digital media with the latest and best historical
   scholarship to promote an understanding of the past as well as broad
   historical literacy. As an online source for a variety of teaching and
   professional aids, CHNM is a useful resource for history teachers of
   any level, with links to 1,200 international history departments; an
   indexed guide to 5,000 history web sites; an annotated guide to 500
   U.S. history sites; a comprehensive directory of 2,000 web site in the
   history of science and technology; and free software tools useful for
   historians and teachers. At its January 2003 meeting during the annual
   meeting in Chicago, Council accepted both organizations as the 113th
   and 114th affiliated societies. (They will, therefore, be included in
   the list of affiliated societies that will appear in the annual report
   for 2003.)

   <p>A meeting for affiliated societies was convened by the committee at
   the annual meeting to discuss relations between the AHA and the
   societies. The attending societies asserted that affiliation with the
   AHA was beneficial to everyone involved.

<h>Committee on Graduate Students

   <p>The transformation (in January 2002) of the Task Force on Graduate
   Education into a standing committee--the AHA Committee for Graduate
   Students [CGS]--represented a striking recognition of the fact that
   graduate students can be more than mere apprentices in the governance
   of the AHA.

   <p>Perhaps the most important task that the CGS accomplished in recent
   months was to establish direct lines of communication--through e-mail
   messages and surveys--with graduate student members of the AHA.

   <p>In addition, the CGS continued the task force practice of organizing
   sessions at AHA annual meetings based on suggestions directly received
   from graduate students who attend the Graduate Student Forum at the
   preceding annual meeting. CGS also sponsored an unprecedented number
   of five sessions at the 2003 annual meeting. These included "Careers
   in History" on the discussion of nonacademic careers and a "Nuts and
   Bolts" workshop on preparing for and participating in the job market.

   <p>Particularly through our liaison, Fiona Galvin, the CGS has
   energetically collaborated with the AHA's Committee on Graduate
   Education (CGE), the body charged with carrying out the first national
   survey of graduate programs in history since 1959. We also
   successfully encouraged participation of graduate students in the
   CGE's site visits to programs across the country, arguing that
   graduate students were uniquely qualified to interview and collect
   anecdotal data from other graduate students.

   <p>As key members of the AHA, graduate students need to and will continue
   to play a central role in shaping the debates and direction of the
   profession today in ways that will ensure its advance along
   increasingly equitable lines.

<h>Committee on International Historical Activities

   <p>During 2002 the AHA's Committee on International Historical Activities
   actively worked with the bureau of the International Congress of
   Historical Sciences (ICHS, also often referred to, by the abbreviation
   from the French, as CISH) toward organizing the 20th International
   Congress to be held July 3-9, 2005, in Sydney, Australia. Dane Kennedy
   and Arnita Jones participated on behalf of the AHA in the General
   Assembly of the ICHS held September 2-3, 2002, at Amsterdam and also
   attended a symposium there on the theme, "Presenting the Nation: Can
   It Be Done?"

   <p>The AHA committee, having invited proposals from members interested in
   participating as organizers, presenters, or discussants in the
   congress, forwarded to the bureau of ICHS over 60 panel proposals and
   17 nominations for session organizers and discussants.

<h>Committee on Minority Historians

   <p>For the Committee on Minority Historians, 2002 was an especially
   productive year . We completed the diversity series of pamphlets and
   began arrangements to have some of the titles published online. We
   participated in two major sessions--at the annual meetings of the
   Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History and the
   Organization of American Historians. The committee not only
   contributed significantly to the survey of the Committee on Graduate
   Education, but also conducted its own survey of the minority members
   of the AHA. The aim of the latter was to determine how the AHA can
   best serve this particular constituency and to provide data to history
   departments and other bodies to assist them in their efforts to
   recruit and retain minority faculty, employees, and students.

   <p>At the 2003 annual meeting of the AHA, the committee
   organized--continuing a tradition of establishing a presence at the
   annual meetings--a session on the theme, "Increasing the Presence of
   Minority Graduate Students in the Profession." Also continuing a
   practice started at the 2002 annual meeting, the committee organized a
   mentoring breakfast at the 2003 meeting. At this resoundingly
   successful gathering, graduate students were able to discuss
   professional concerns with senior faculty members in an informal and
   relaxed setting.

   <p>The committee discussed at length a statement about recruitment and
   retention of minority faculty, which had been issued by the Modern
   Language Association's Committee on the Literature of People of Color
   in the United States and Canada. To facilitate broader discussion of
   the document (with a view to issuing a similar statement), the
   committee is publicizing the MLA committee's statement.

   <p>The work of the committee was facilitated by the tireless efforts of
   numerous people, but as the outgoing chair, I would like to especially
   express my thanks to the members of the committee as well as to
   Noralee Frankel, Arnita Jones, Cliff Jacobs, Peleg Tal, and other AHA
   staff members.

<h>The Joint Committee on Part-Time and Adjunct Employment

   <p>Concern about the increasing number of historians teaching as
   part-time or adjunct faculty led to the creation of a permanent Joint
   OAH-AHA Committee on Part-Time and Adjunct Employment in January 2002,
   whose membership has consisted primarily of those who are, or who have
   in the past, taught part-time. The rise in part-time and adjunct
   employment is a serious, growing issue in the profession. The litany
   of problems include abysmally low pay, often total lack of benefits
   (medical coverage is frequently the most pressing need, but the lack
   of pension funds has serious long range implications), ineligibility
   for grants or travel money (to help with research that just might make
   escape possible), poor or no office space or assistance, lack of
   computers (as technology becomes ever more important), and sometimes
   no library access.

   <p>The problem is complicated by the fact that there are those who prefer
   to teach part-time so that proposed solutions need to leave this
   possibility open. This includes retired faculty still engaged with the
   discipline, those with other full-time employment or family
   responsibilities, as well as graduate students working to complete
   their degrees. There are also small departments that can only offer a
   specialized course with a part-time/adjunct employee. Another aspect
   of the issue is the numerous institutions dealing with financial cuts
   by hiring a large number of teachers at very low wages, who then try
   to survive by piecing together jobs at several institutions. Solutions
   need to go in two directions. One is to halt and reverse the bleeding
   of full-time positions. The second is to make life better and fairer
   for those who do teach part-time. The committee's recommendations to
   the OAH and AHA include provisions for a limit on the percentage of
   part-time faculty in a department, for increased salaries (as a
   percentage of what is paid to full-time faculty), benefits, office
   space, etc. Having the recommendations accepted is just the first
   step. The harder task ahead will be to convince those in control of
   the purse strings that this is necessary.

<h>The Committee on Women Historians

   <p>The Committee on Women Historians "met" on the web between October 23
   and November 4, 2002, with all members participating. Our discussions
   focused primarily on two issues: (1) the committee's survey of women
   members and (2) the status of the pamphlet series, "Women's and Gender
   History in Global Perspective."

   <p>The survey was sent to all post-PhD female AHA members last spring, by
   e-mail; 361 replies were received. Members were asked to comment on
   whether or not gender had, in their opinion or experience, been a
   factor in their careers as historians. They were also asked to
   comment, in an open-ended format, on what factors in particular aided
   or hindered their advancement in the profession; whether mentoring had
   played any role in their careers; and on anything else they wanted the
   committee to know about their experiences as historians. Demographic
   data (year of terminal degree, type of employment, rank, race/ethnic
   origin) were also collected. Various members of the committee have
   been assessing the data since it was received, with the assistance of
   Cliff Jacobs of the AHA staff. The most significant findings cluster
   around issues of collegiality and its assessment--which are difficult
   to document and to correlate with women's professional advancement.
   Other findings center on women's perceptions of ongoing gender
   discrimination at all ranks of the professoriate.

   <p>The committee assessed the current status of the pamphlet series. The
   AHA has signed a contract with the University of Illinois Press for
   the publication of the pamphlets in volume form. Nearly all of the
   contracted pamphlets have been received by the series editor Bonnie
   Smith and reviewed by the committee. The committee was pleased to see
   the pamphlets moving toward publication with a major press, and
   grateful to the AHA staff and to Bonnie Smith for moving the process
   along.

   <p>The committee discussed preparations for the 2004 annual meeting. The
   committee also discussed its mission statement and the ongoing work of
   the Task Force on Graduate Education. Virginia Sanchez-Korrol was
   commended for her service to the committee.

   <p>I would like to take this opportunity to thank Noralee Frankel of the
   AHA staff for her spirited, creative, and highly professional work in
   support of the work of the CWH for the past three years (my tenure as
   chair).

<h>The Task Force on Public History

   <p>Upon recommendation by the Professional Division, Council charged the
   Task Force on Public History to identify ways the Association can
   address the interests and concerns of public historians as well as
   ways of deepening an understanding of and appreciation for the
   activities of public historians within the profession. Our final
   report, to be submitted to Council at the end of 2003, will include
   both a substantive discussion of issues and recommendations pursuant
   to our charge.

   <p>Two fundamental assumptions have governed our work to date. First,
   public history is a responsibility of all historians. Public history
   is not a subset of history, nor are public historians a subset of
   historians. Second, public history and public historians are
   underserved and underregarded by both the AHA and the profession, a
   situation that needs redress. We also note a widespread interest in
   and greater engagement with public history by the profession.

   <p>The task force has pursued its charge by reviewing the Statement on
   Standards, identifying possible changes to the annual meeting,
   consulting with the Committee on Graduate Education, considering
   public history employment, and discussing collaborations with other
   history-related organizations. We have also identified the need for
   advocacy for public history at the state level. And to identify
   interests, needs, and concerns related to public history and public
   historians, we conducted two surveys: one of all AHA members and one
   of public historians. We also conducted open forums at AHA's 2002 and
   2003 annual meetings.

   <p>I conclude by acknowledging the creative thinking and hard work of
   task force members, and the invaluable advice and support provided by
   AHA staff, especially Arnita Jones and Debbie Ann Doyle.

<h>The Task Force on Intellectual Property

   <p>The TFIP "met" via e-mail as necessary, and at the Chicago annual
   meeting. Our initial charge was to advise the Council on intellectual
   property (IP) matters that might require Council action. Only one such
   matter arose this year, as I will report below, but we have been
   considering whether we should not attempt a project that might be of
   considerable use and interest to the membership--a short guide to
   copyright issues pertaining to historians. While there is by no means
   universal agreement as to what the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright
   Act (DMCA) means, we believe that we can lay out some general
   parameters. We also propose to explore the possibility of preparing
   articles on recent developments in intellectual property issues for
   publication in Perspectives.

   <p>The Task Force had a very good discussion (through e-mail) of the
   efforts begun by Larry Lessig (Stanford Univ. School of Law) to
   challenge the recent Sonny Bono Term Extension Act, which added 20
   years to the life of copyrights. The ostensible rationale for the
   extension was that the United States needed to conform to the new
   international standard of 70 years for copyrights (at a time when the
   U.S. standard was 50 years). The TFIP was unanimous in its view that
   the Bono Act created bad policy for the work of historians, and
   recommended to the Council that the AHA join the Association of
   Research Libraries' amicus brief supporting the Lessig constitutional
   challenge to the Bono Act in what has become known as the Eldred v.
   Ashcroft case. We were subsequently solicited by a group preparing an
   amicus brief speaking specifically for historians, but because we felt
   that we should not sign two briefs, we did not recommend going forward
   with the second. Lessig argued our position to the United States
   Supreme Court this spring, and the Court will probably hand down its
   opinion in the late spring of 2003. This may be an extremely important
   decision, because the Act is being challenged on the grounds that the
   only constitutional basis for copyright regulation is the promotion of
   creativity. A decision in favor of the challenge would open the way to
   further litigation against aspects of the DMCA, and might be extremely
   important to the scholarly community.

<h>The Pacific Coast Branch of the AHA

   <p>The AHA Council, meeting in San Francisco in January 2002 endorsed the
   revision of Article II of the constitution of the Pacific Coast Branch
   (PCB) to clarify the purposes of the organization, specifically: "The
   purposes of the organization shall be the advancement of the interests
   of the American Historical Association, and the promotion of the
   historical interests of the membership with special emphasis on the
   United States, western Canada, Mexico, the Pacific Rim, and their
   inter-relationships."

   <p>At the 2002 annual meeting of the PCB, held in August at Tucson,
   nearly 150 individuals participated in 37 academic sessions. The
   program also included two luncheon speakers--one sponsored by the
   Western Association of Women Historians and another honoring the
   hundredth anniversary of the PCB--and one banquet address by President
   Thomas Alexander.

   <p>The following prizes were awarded during the year: the Louis Knott
   Koontz Memorial Award for the most deserving article to appear in the
   Pacific Historical Review in the volume year 2001 to Evan Ward for his
   August 2001 article, "The Ghosts of William Walker: Conquest of Land
   and Water as Central Themes in the History of the Colorado River
   Delta"; the W. Turrentine Jackson Prize for an outstanding essay by a
   graduate student to Robert B. Campbell for his article, "Newlands, Old
   Lands: Native American Labor, Agrarian Ideology and the
   Progressive-Era State in the Making of the Newlands Reclamation
   Project, 1902-1926"; the W. Turrentine Jackson Dissertation Award to
   Jessica B. Teisch (Univ. of California at Berkeley) for her
   dissertation, "Engineering Progress: Californians and the Making of a
   Global Economy"; the Norris and Carol Hundley Award to Henry Yu for
   his book Thinking Orientals: Migration, Contact, and Exoticism in
   Modern America (Oxford University Press, 2002); the PCB Book Award
   jointly to Daniel Herman for his book, Hunting and the American
   Imagination (Smithsonian Institution Press, 2001) and to Adel Perry,
   for the book, On the Edge of Empire (University of Toronto Press,
   2001).

   <p>Election: By mail ballots cast during the summer 2002, the PCB
   membership chose Roger L. Nichols (Univ. of Arizona), as
   president-elect; David Yoo (Claremont McKenna College), Katherine G.
   Morrissey (Univ. of Arizona), and Albert S. Broussard (Texas A&M
   Univ.), as members of the Council; and Cheryl A. Koos (California
   State Univ. at Los Angeles), Michael J. Gonzales (Univ. of San Diego),
   and Carl Abbott (Portland State Univ.) as members of the Nominating
   Committee.

   <p>Finances: As of December 31, 2002, the PCB held $142,210 in endowment
   funds for the Pacific Historical Review, the Louis Knott Koontz Award,
   the Norris and Carol Hundley Prize, the W. Turrentine Jackson Prize,
   the W. Turrentine Jackson Dissertation Award, and the PCB Reserve
   Fund. Total assets owned by the Branch as of December 31, 2001, were
   valued at $176,536. For the fiscal year, July 1, 2001, to June 30,
   2002, the income for the Pacific Historical Review (which had a
   circulation of 1,350 in December 2001) was $103,957, and expenses
   (including a $3,500 subsidy to the PHR editorial office and a $4,829
   royalty payment to the PCB) totaled $69,824.

<h>The 2002 Program Committee

   <p>The 2002 Annual Meeting of the American Historical Association was,
   thanks to the efficiency of the AHA staff, a smoothly run and very
   successful event. A wide range of papers and an attendance beyond what
   we might have expected in light of the events of September 11, 2001,
   attest to the continued relevance of the AHA to the profession.

   <p>The 2002 Program Committee received 358 proposals for presentations at
   the conference, of which we were able to accept only 157. Proposals
   came not only from our local colleagues here in the United States, but
   from Europe, Australasia, and elsewhere. Our
   theme--"Frontiers"--produced a wonderful diversity of panels, and
   clearly spoke to the growing interest in regional comparative studies.
   We received an unusually high number of comparative proposals, and
   were able therefore to offer many panels designed to draw people from
   a broader than usual range of regional specialisms.

   <p>The topical breakdown of proposals received is as follows:

   <p>*Panels that are sponsored by various AHA bodies and thus guaranteed a
   place on the program. These are included in the figures for the
   "Accepted" column.

   <p>Our experience was an exhilarating and exciting one. The job of
   program chair is an arduous one, though made considerably easier by
   the experience and efficiency of the AHA staff.

   <p>We owe a tremendous debt to our Program Committee colleagues. We owe
   our thanks also to Gabrielle Spiegel, vice president of the Research
   Division, and Wm. Roger Louis, 2001 president, who were generously
   supportive of our ideas and efforts. We are eternally in the debt of
   Joe Wright, our extraordinarily gifted graduate assistant, and we are
   grateful also to the AHA staff, most notably Sharon K. Tune, Debbie
   Doyle, Vernon Horn, Robert Townsend, and Pillarisetti Sudhir.

<h>The 2003 Program Committee

   <p>The 117th annual meeting of the American Historical Association held
   in Chicago, January 2-5, 2003, was a huge success. The program
   featured 168 panels that covered virtually every major historical
   theme and topic, time period, and region of the world. Attendance
   throughout was excellent, and most of the sessions, including those
   held on Sunday, drew sizable audiences.

   <p>The 2003 Program Committee received only 203 proposals, a considerable
   drop from the 2002 tally of more than 350 submissions. This noticeable
   decline in submissions may have stemmed from a variety of reasons such
   as cyclical fluctuations, the absence of a specific theme for the
   meeting, and Chicago in January being less attractive than, say, an
   East or West Coast locale.

   <p>Nevertheless, the Program Committee was extremely pleased with the
   proposals it had to choose from and debated their pros and cons at a
   meeting held April 19-21, 2002, in Washington, D.C. The following is a
   breakdown of proposals received and accepted:

   <p>Based on my experience of serving on this year's committee, I have
   several observations to make that may be worth considering in the
   future. As the subject distribution above reveals, we need to continue
   to diversify and enhance the program. We probably should be more
   proactive in soliciting panel proposals on Africa and the ancient
   period because they are traditionally underrepresented year after
   year. Although there were no panels that dealt exclusively with
   Africa, five panels included coverage of it. I suspect submissions
   relating to Asia, comparative, Middle East, world, and "other" will
   continue to increase and take their place alongside the consistently
   significant presence of American, European, and Latin American panels.
   The mix of regions will also change from year-to-year as
   theme-centered programs call for and encourage cross-regional
   comparisons.

   <p>Although several panels--especially those in the categories of
   "pedagogy" and "other"--were included in the program because they were
   sponsored submissions, it may be worth noting that they would have
   found a place even on their own merits.

   <p>A wonderful innovation for the 2003 meeting was the addition of six
   presidential sessions that enriched the program by adding content that
   may not have otherwise been well represented. Lynn Hunt, the 2002
   president, consulted the Program Committee about her choice of topics
   and panelists and judiciously scheduled the presidential sessions to
   occupy key time slots on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. These panels
   were a major highlight of the Chicago meeting. All the presentations
   were first-rate and attendance at some of them ran into the hundreds.

   <p>No Program Committee makes much headway without the heroic efforts of
   the AHA staff--especially Sharon K. Tune and Debbie Doyle--in
   facilitating the crucial Washington, D.C. meeting. Thanks are due as
   well to Lynn Hunt, the AHA Council, the members of the committee and,
   especially, to Lora Knight (Univ. of Utah), the committee's graduate
   student assistant.
