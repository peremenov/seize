                         <h>The 1997 General Election
<h>The 1997 General Election

   <p>Total seats contested : 659

   <p>Labour
   : 419 seats (63.6% of total seats); 43.2% of popular vote. Gained 146
   seats from 1992; lost no seats from 1992 results

   <p>Tories
   : 165 seats (25.1% of total seats); 30.7% of popular vote. Gained 0
   seats from 1992; lost 178 seats from 1992 results.

   <p>Liberal Democrats
   : 46 seats (7% of total seats); 16.8% of popular vote. Gained 28 seats
   from 1992; lost 2 seats from 1992 results.

   <p>Others : 29 seats (4.3 of total seats); 7% of popular vote. Gained 5
   seats from 1992; lost 0 seats from 1992.

   <p>Others = SNP (6), PC (4), Independent (1), Northern Irish seats (18)

   <p>Added together, all the seats in opposition = 240. Therefore, if all
   Opposition MPs voted against the government and all the government MPs
   voted for the government, the government would have a clear majority
   of 179. If 50 maverick Labour MPs voted against the government on
   whatever issue, the government would still have a majority of 129 -
   huge by parliamentary standards.

   <p>Note :
   1997 represented a record number of Labour seats The turnout for this
   election was 71% - the lowest for 62 years (1935) 120 female MPs were
   returned : 101 to Labour and 14 to the Tories 5 Asian and 4
   African-British MPs were elected - all Labour The former BBC
   correspondent Martin Bell won as an Independent against Neil Hamilton,
   the incumbent Tory MP then accused of corruption (and found guilty of
   it) the election returned the youngest MP to Westminster - 24 years of
   age. the election was the Tories worst showing since 1906. the LibDems
   own the highest number of Third Party seats since 1929. the Referendum
   Party spent an estimated Â£20 on 547 candidates and received 3% of the
   total cast votes. They lost all their deposits. the % of Tory votes
   for all votes cast, was the lowest since 1832 the swing from the
   Tories to Labour was 10% - the largest figure ever and twice that of
   the previous highest BUT the % of Labour votes cast was lower than in
   its election victories of 1945 and 1966 and its electoral defeats in
   1950 and 1964. voter turnout in strong Labour areas was down in 1997
   the 75 seats won by LibDems + others was the highest since 1923.


   <h>Why did the Conservatives lose the 1997 election ?

   <p>Why did the Conservatives lose, especially at a time of economic
   recovery?

   <p>Forced withdrawal from ERM in 1992 (which, paradoxically, helped
   recovery)

   <p>Unpopular policies, for example, rail privatisation, VAT

   <p>Air of arrogance and hubris, for example, sleaze, cheating on pairing
   on fishing quotas (1996), arms to Iraq, IRA prison escapes, BSE,
   judicial reviews, reluctance of ministers to accept responsibilities
   and resign

   <p>Minority government by end of 1996. Government dependent in Commons on
   Unionists; abandonment of IRA ceasefire early in 1996.

   <p>February 1997 Wirral South by-election: 1 7 per cent swing to Labour.
   (Unhappy irony: the Conservative candidates name, Leslie Byrom, is
   anagram of loser by mile)

   <p>Manifest and bitter party disunity over Europe, especially
   smack-of-firm-compromise wait and see approach to a single European
   currency

   <p>Longest post-war electoral campaign - backfired. Boredom and further
   sleaze

   <p>Sniping from the wings by James Goldsmiths Referendum Party and Alan
   Skeds Independence Party

   <p>Defections by pro-Europeans such as Alan Howarth and Emma Nicholson

   <p>Unpopularity of Major when compared to Blair

   <p>Conservative Norman Lamont said government gave the impression of
   being in office but not in power

   <p>inept campaigning, for example, demon eyes and weeping lion posters
   ridiculed

   <p>Conservative press largely turned against them especially "The Sun".

   <p>Time for a change - widely held public sentiment


   <h>Why did Labour win?

   <p>Labour benefited by:

   <p>Internal reforms, for example, some reduction in trade union power;
   One Member One Vote

   <p>John Smiths death in 1994 allowed creation of New Labour by the more
   modernising Blair - notably, abandonment of Clause IV in 1995

   <p>Rapid centralisation of party and presentation around leader and
   spin-doctors at Millbank election headquarters and a highly polished
   campaign

   <p>Abandonment of traditional socialist - or even social democratic -
   principles and acceptance of market economics, low inflation and
   interest rates, cuts in taxation, spending and welfare. Pre-election
   commitment to maintain existing tax levels for a five-year term and
   present spending levels for two years, welfare to work, tough law and
   order especially for juvenile offenders. Difficult for the
   Conservatives to criticise what were, largely, their own policies

   <p>Desire for power, combined with growing party discipline, largely
   silenced left-wing Labour dissidents. The campaign was hit by no major
   blows from the extreme left which could have de-stabilised the
   election effort. Europe was not an obviously contentious issue as it
   was for the Tories.

   <p>New, radical proposals for constitutional reform

   <p>Lack of clear blue water between the two main parties threatened to
   squeeze the Liberal Democrats but - despite a lower vote than in 1992
   - they won over twice as many seats due to careful targeting of their
   limited resources and skilful tactical voting by anti-Conservative
   voters.

   <h>What about 2001 ?

   <p>From the above, it is safe to conclude that Labour will win the next
   election. It is a safe betor is it ?

   <p>One of the main things that came out of the 1997 election was voter
   volatility. If it happened in 1997, then it could happen in 2001. The
   number of people who changed support from the 1992 election to the
   1997 election has been as high as 23% by NOP. This is an increase of
   2% from the 1987 election. If this trend is continued, as many as 25%
   may change their voting allegiance in 2001.

   <p>In 1997, Labour had very strong representation amongst the 18 to 29
   years old age group. If this group feels significantly let down by the
   last 5 years of Labour government, it could turn against Blair. In the
   5 years from 1992 to 1995, the Tories lost 18% support among this
   group while Labour won 19% from this group.

   <p>The evidence tends to suggest that the Tories suffered the most from
   tactical voting

   <p>The Tories suffered in 1997 from the electoral system. If the Tories
   had got the number of seats that their percentage of votes in each
   constituency represented, then the overall Labour majority would have
   been cut to 131 - still very large from a Parliamentary perspective.
   Likewise, the LibDems success would have been cut to 28 seats rather
   than 46. But the support for the Tories is concentrated primarily in
   the south, whereas support for the Labour Party has expanded away from
   the traditional areas associated with the Labour Party. But expansion
   can always lead to contraction and tactical voting in 1997 might not
   repeat itself in 2001.
