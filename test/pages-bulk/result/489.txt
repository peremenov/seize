   <p>Rarely does life present the opportunity to change the world in such a
    profoundly positive way. We are called to action today, inspired by
    legendary leaders who understood that today's actions and words will
                          echo long into tomorrow.

      <p>Before the Congress of the United States is AGOA III, the Africa
   Growth and Opportunity Act. AGOA is a commitment to Africa's destiny,
    charted by Africans, encouraged by Americans, and expressed in hopes
       and dreams that have stirred great nations throughout history.


   <p>Africa can bridge the political divide. AGOA can bind Republicans and
    Democrats, embracing an African destiny that recalls American's own
                         struggle for independence.

      <p>We establish this place to bring voices, and faces, and nations,
    together. To share, and learn, and understand. Join us. Contemplate
   what role America can play in Africa's destiny. Celebrate what Africa
                          is, what Africa will be.

                               <h>Jim McDermott

     <h>Bono Appeals to House and Senate Leaders to Quickly Pass AGOA III


    <p>Earlier this year Bono spoke to Members of the U.S. House and Senate
      and African diplomats. He said that Africans were terrified that
    provisions of AGOA would expire in September 2004, and he urged the
                     Congress to quickly pass AGOA III
   <p>The front man for the Irish rock band U2 founded the organization DATA
   (Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa) in 2002 to advocate for debt relief, AIDS
         funding, and a fair international trade policy for Africa.

   <p>The AGOA Acceleration Act, a trade law authored by McDermott enacted
   last summer, required the president to conduct country-by country
   studies on trade and investment opportunities in sub Saharan Africa.
   The report details many opportunities for entrepreneurs while also
   pointing the barriers to economic growth in key sectors and it makes
   recommendations to policy makers about ways in which to overcome these
   challenges.

   <h>White House Press Release

   <h>For Immediate Release
   <h>Office of the Press Secretary
   <h>July 13, 2004
   <h>President Bush Signs African Growth and Opportunity Act 
   <h>Remarks by the President at Signing of the Agoa Acceleration Act of
   2004
   <h>Dwight David Eisenhower Executive Office Building

   <p>THE PRESIDENT: Thanks for coming. In just four years, the African
   Growth and Opportunity Act has shown the power of free markets to
   improve the lives of people in both the United States and Africa. By
   reducing barriers to trade, this law has increased export, created
   jobs, and expanded opportunity for Africans and Americans alike. It
   has given American businesses greater confidence to invest in Africa,
   and encouraged African nations to reform their economies and
   governments to take advantage of the opportunities that AGOA provides.
   So today I'm pleased to build on that success and extend the law's
   benefits long into the future by signing the AGOA Acceleration Act of
   2004.

   <p>This
   legislation is a product of strong bipartisan cooperation, and I thank
   the members of the House and the Senate for working together on this
   very important piece of legislation. And I want to thank those in the
   audience who worked hard to see that the bill made it to my desk as
   quickly as it did.

   <p>Mr. Secretary, thank you very much for your leadership. Secretary
   Powell is a strong believer in the potential of the continent of
   Africa, and so am I.

   <p>I appreciate so very much Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist for
   joining us today. Senator, thank you for coming. I'm pleased to see
   that my friend, the Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee,
   Max Baucus, is still standing. And I appreciate your leadership, sir.
   We're honored that Dick Lugar, who is the Chairman of the Senate
   Foreign Relations Committee, is with us. Mr. Chairman, thank you, and
   thank you for your clear vision for a better world. I appreciate so
   very much the members of the Ways and Means Committee who are here
   with us -- the Chairman and Ranking Member -- Chairman Bill Thomas,
   who's worked so hard for this legislation, as has his friend and
   Ranking Member, Charlie Rangel, both fine members of the Congress.
   Thank you all for being here, and thanks for your good work. I also am
   honored that Ed Royce, the Chairman of the International Relations
   Sub-committee on Africa, has joined us, and soon will be joined by
   Donald Payne, the Ranking Member, as well.

   <p>These members put in good work. They worked hard. They brought the
   other members of Congress along with them, many of whom are with us.

   <p>I am honored that the dean of the African Diplomatic Corps stands with
   me today. Mr. Ambassador, thank you for coming. I'm proud you're here.
   And thank you for representing the other ambassadors who have joined
   us today. We appreciate you taking time to come. And thanks for
   supporting this legislation.

   <p>There's a growing consensus in both Africa and the United States that
   open trade and international investment are the surest and fastest
   ways for Africa to make progress. That's what you have said; that's
   what Congress had responded to. For too many years, the world's
   efforts to promote Africa's development were focused on aid.
   Development aid is important. Nothing wrong with aid. And my
   administration has substantially increased aid to Africa, and we
   appreciate working with the members to do that.

<p>But as Uganda's President Museveni has
   said, "By itself, aid cannot transform societies. Only trade can
   foster the sustained economic growth necessary for such
   transformation." This African leader understands that when nations
   close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a privileged few, no
   amount of development aid is ever enough. But when nations respect
   their people, open their markets, expand freedom and opportunity to
   all their citizens, entire societies can be lifted out of poverty and
   despair. This is a hopeful piece of legislation. As America works for
   open markets and opportunity on the African continent, we will also
   confront disease and hunger and the violence that undermines progress
   and hope.

   <p>I'm deeply concerned about the humanitarian and human rights crisis in
   Darfur, Sudan. For the sake of peace and basic humanity, I echo the
   sentiments of the Secretary of State. I call upon the government of
   Sudan to stop the Janjaweed violence. I call on all parties of the
   conflict to respect the cease-fire, to respect human rights, and to
   allow for the free movement of humanitarian workers and aid. The
   United States and the United Nations and the leadership of the African
   Union are working to bring relief to the suffering people of that
   region. America will continue to strongly support these efforts for
   peace.

   <p>One way to spread peace is to encourage political and economic reform
   across Africa by opening markets here in the United States. It's
   important for our people to understand, by opening United States
   markets we make it more likely there will be peace on the continent of
   Africa.

   <p>AGOA nations are strengthening the rule of law. They are lowering
   trade barriers, they're combating corruption, and eliminating child
   labor. They're setting an important example for the entire continent,
   demonstrating that governments that respect individual rights and
   encourage the development of their markets are more likely to grow
   economically and achieve political stability.

   <p>Like all good partnerships, AGOA has been beneficial to all parties.
   Free trade between the United States and sub-Sahara Africa has created
   jobs, wealth, and opportunity on both continents. Last year, under
   AGOA, African exports to the United States increased by 55 percent,
   and African -- and American businesses saw a 15-percent increase in
   our exports to sub-Sahara Africa that equals almost $7 billion. The
   most notable gains were made by American companies selling
   agricultural goods and machinery and transportation equipment.

   <p>See, when you sell goods in Africa, it means somebody is finding work
   here at home. Trade must work both ways. AGOA has been beneficial to
   the people of the continent of Africa and to the people of the United
   States of America. That's why this is a good piece of legislation.

   <p>Since its enactment in 2000, AGOA has generated over $340 million in
   investment and created thousands of jobs. Things are happening because
   of the law we're extending today, positive things for people in Africa
   and in America. The enactment of this law will help ensure that this
   mutually beneficial trade continues. Trade and investment from around
   the world is essential to world peace. The United States and the
   nations of the sub-Saharan Africa are working together to break down
   trade barriers around the world -- not just between ourselves, but
   around the world.

   <p>My trade representative, Ambassador Bob Zoellick is in Africa right
   now. He's meeting with his counterparts from across the continent to
   prepare for the World Trade Organization meeting in Geneva later this
   month. These are important meetings. They're important meetings for
   the people of the United States; they're important meetings for the
   people on the continent of Africa. And the reason why is because we
   want to advance our shared economic agenda, and it's very important
   for our AGOA partners to help make these talks in Geneva a success.
   Pass the word on to your capitals.

   <p>No region has more to gain from free markets than Africa -- that's the
   message. And no region has more to lose from a stalled WTO process
   than Africa. By working together and by our example, we can show the
   world that a new global trade agreement can bring greater prosperity
   to all nations.

   <p>Real prosperity is the work of many years. I know that. It's hard
   work. It's hard to change the status quo. This law encourages the
   change in the status quo.

   <p>I'm so pleased and proud to see the ambassadors from the African
   nations who are here. Thank you all for coming. You've worked hard to
   make AGOA a success. You've worked hard to spread the message in the
   halls of Congress, and your hard work has paid off. I share your
   optimism about Africa's future. That's what we believe. Those of us
   who are standing up here believe in the future of Africa. We
   appreciate the commitment to freedom. We appreciate your understanding
   that we all have an obligation to spread opportunity throughout all
   corners of this important part of the world.

   <p>And now, it is my honor to sign this important piece of legislation.
