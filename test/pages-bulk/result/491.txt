   <p>12. Out-of-province/country coverage: If you (or your insured
   dependent) are temporarily out of the province or out of the country
   on vacation or business, you are covered for emergency health care.

   <p>For travel within Canada there is a reciprocal agreement among
   provincial health care plans in all provinces except Quebec. In Quebec
   charges are higher than those in the other provinces, and Great-West
   Life will pay the amount not paid by OHIP, therefore should you
   require emergency medical treatment in Quebec, you need to access the
   MEDEX toll free line to ensure appropriate processing of claims.

   <p>When travelling outside of Canada, charges for emergency treatment
   will be paid at 100% if you are under age 65 and 80% if you are age 65

   purchase additional out-of-country insurance.

   <p>The following services are included:
     * <l>room and board in a hospital up to the hospital's standard ward
       rate for each day that you (or your insured dependent) are
       confined in the hospital,
     * <l>hospital services and supplies furnished by a hospital, and
     * <l>diagnosis and treatment by a physician or surgeon legally licensed
       to practise medicine.

   <p>MEDEX Assistance Corporation must be notified within 48 hours, or when
   reasonably possible, following an emergency. Claims may be denied or
   reduced if contact is not made with MEDEX Assistance Corporation
   within 48 hours of admission to hospital.
   If in the opinion of a physician or MEDEX Assistance Corporation the
   patient can be returned home or to another medical facility for
   immediate or continuing treatment and the patient chooses not to for
   whatever reason, the claim will be denied for payment by MEDEX.

   <p>"Emergency" means any sudden critical, unforeseen or unexpected
   occurrence requiring immediate medical attention and which takes place
   outside your province of residence while the coverage is in force.
   Great-West Life does not consider complications during the last 9
   weeks of pregnancy as an "emergency" and does not cover
   out-of-province medical treatment in these cases.

   <p>"Hospital" means an institution having diagnostic facilities that
   provides active, chronic care or emergency treatment with physicians
   and registered nurses in attendance 24 hours a day and is so licensed
   by the appropriate governmental authority. It does not include an
   institution providing convalescent care, a nursing home, home for the
   aged, a rest home or any other facility providing similar care.
