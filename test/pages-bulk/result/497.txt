   <h>Abstract

   <p>This paper presents a survey of some of the major groups and
   activities that are shaping the future of the Internet's role in
   education. It also covers some projects that benefit administrative,
   instructional, professional development and community outreach
   projects and applications, and some exciting current initiatives
   around the U.S. Finally, it discusses some of the barriers that face
   schools in getting connected to the Internet. The paper was written
   with a U.S.perspective.

   <h>I. Introduction

   <p>The school community (commonly referred to as K-12 in the U.S.,
   meaning kindergarten through 12th grade) is starting to focus its
   attention on the Internet.Most school networking activity has occurred
   in the U.S., however, there are projects being initiated in Canada,
   Japan, the UK and other countries. The Internet is being used for all
   aspects of education, including administrative, educational,
   professional development, and community building.

   <p>A recent informal census conducted via voluntary reportings over the
   Internet estimates the number of teachers and students (individual and
   classroom accounts) in the U.S. using the Internet, either directly or
   indirectly, at almost 250,000. The number of educational resources,
   databases, mailing lists, and archives is also growing rapidly -- so
   much so that one educator recently lamented on an education mailing
   list there was too much available, that the sheer number of
   distributed services was large enough to overwhelm the novice teacher
   embarking for the first time on a digital professional development
   trip. (This problem is being addressed with the appearance of user
   friendly search and retrieval tools that present a simple, organized
   face of the Internet, such as Gopher and the WorldWideWeb.)

   <p>The state of educational networking is being shaped by many groups,
   networking initiatives, pilot projects and new challenges. Some of
   these are outlined below.

   <h>II. International Groups and Projects

   <p>Some of the international direction and evangelism for K12 networking
   is being headed by the Internet Society's K-12 Committee.

   <p>The Internet Society (ISOC) is a professional organization that is
   chartered to facilitate and support the technical evolution of the
   Internet as a research and education infrastructure, and to educate
   the members on its technology, uses and applications. The ISOC's K-12
   committee was formed about 2 years ago to promote the use of
   networking in the classroom, discuss issues related to teachers and
   children accessing the Internet and to propose concrete and useful
   solutions to barriers facing educators and students.

   <h>II.A. IETF Involvement

   <p>Among the many projects its members are working on, the Internet
   Engineering Task Force (IETF) is working on school-related efforts.

   <p>For example, the IETF's Internet School Networking (ISN) Working Group
   recently wrote a Request for Comments (RFC) For Your Information (FYI)
   document (RFC1578) called "FYI on Questions and Answers - Answers to
   Commonly Asked Primary and Secondary School Internet User." The
   various sections answer questions about obtaining an Internet
   connection, technical implementation and technical options, security
   and ethics, educational collaboration, projects and resources.

   <p>This working group is creating other useful documents. One of
   these"K-12 Internetworking Guidelines" explains what schools need to
   know for future networking plans.

   <h>II. B. U.S. Groups and Networks

   <p>In the U.S., there is the well known National Research and Education
   Network (NREN) part of the High Performance Computing and
   Communications Act of 1991. The more recent National Information
   Infrastructure (NII) initiative, which is much broader in scale, is
   intended to benefit K-12 education in terms of ubiquitous connectivity
   to all schools. Indeed, the Clinton/Gore Administration recently
   issued an ambitious challenge calling for all schools and libraries to
   be connected to the NII by the year 2000. Many businesses have
   responded with pledges to make this a reality.

   <h>II.C. The Consortium for School Networking

   <p>The Consortium for School Networking (COSN) is a membership
   organization of institutions, companies and individuals charged with
   promoting the use of computer network technology in K-12 education
   within the United States. Services COSN provides to its members
   include regular newsletters on networking topics of interest, an
   extensive on-line gopher server of education networks, projects and
   resources. COSN has also testified to Congress on behalf of K-12
   networking interests.

   <p>One of the latest efforts from COSN was a project funded by the
   National Science Foundation and being conducted in cooperation with
   the Federation of American Research Networks (FARNET).

   <p>The project, called "Building Consensus and Models," brought together
   representatives from industry, national, state and local levels. Five
   groups formed, each charged with laying out the key requirements and
   proposed models for a certain topic.The topics and models included
   educational reform and restructuring for a technology-intensive
   society; connectivity and access; technical and user support;
   financial; and curriculum and content. (See the COSN Gopher for more
   information.)

   <h>II. D. U.S. State Projects

   <p>In the U.S., state-level discussion are underway for a mix of
   connectivity and content solutions.

   <p>Many states have decided not to reinvent the wheel and are
   recommending schools and districts connect to existing midlevel and
   commercial networks, while providing a multi-phase approach to giving
   teachers and administrators Internet connectivity.

   <p>One example of state-based education networking is the Texas Education
   Network, also known as TENET.TENET has received lots of attention
   because of its success in leveraging an existing network, the Texas
   Higher Education Network (THEnet) as a backbone networking
   infrastructure. THEnet is a statewide Internet-connected network that
   provides services to over 100 education and research organizations in
   Texas.It is operated and maintained by the University of Texas System
   Office of Telecommunication Services in Austin, Texas.

   <p>The requirements for access are minimal; an educator can dial into 1
   of 18 local points of presence (Cisco CommServers and modem pools
   connected to THEnet member universities) using existing equipment in
   his home or classroom: a computer (PC or Macintosh), a modem and a
   phone line. (An 800 number serves those not located in a local calling
   area.)The costs for access are low; teachers can currently get an
   account on the TENET computers for $5/year.

   <p>The success of this project is obvious: after a little over 2 years of
   operation, 30,000 educators are using TENET. The Internet and TENET
   have been demonstrated enthusiastically in every school district and
   the benefits and uses are now obvious to many people. As a result,
   many school districts are planning for direct connections to the Texas
   Higher Education Network. Additionally, all 20 Texas Education Service
   Centers (ESCs) have recently connected to THEnet.

   <p>Other states have had similar successes to TENET's. Virginia's Public
   Education Network (VAPEN) and Florida's Information Resource Network
   (FIRN) are also dial-up networks servicing thousands and thousands of
   teachers. The state of California offers dial-up Internet access to
   teachers through the California State University (CSU) network; this
   K-12 network is called California On-line Resources for Education
   (CORE) and is operated both by the California State University system
   and the California Department of Education. Oregon announced in
   September 1993 their ambitious OPEN initiative (Oregon Public
   Education Network) to connect all school districts, giving Internet
   access to 500,000 educators and students. Hawaii is investigating
   interconnecting all of its public schools to a statewide cable system.
   And other states have announced or are working on statewide
   initiatives.

   <h>III. Benefits of Using the Internet for Education

   <p>In order for the Internet to successfully be integrated into schools,
   benefits must be shown for all aspects of education: instructional,
   administrative, professional development and community involvement.
   The Internet is already proving itself in these areas as evidenced by
   some major initiatives.Some of these projects are described here.

   <h>III. A. Administrative Uses

   <p>There is quite a big business in US education for administrative
   applications, systems that provide everything from student record
   creation and maintenance, class scheduling, to food services and
   accounting. For the most part, these systems are accessible to local
   district or regions only and are not networked into larger systems.

   <p>This is unfortunate as there is much need for the ability to transfer
   administrative information between schools and districts. The US
   student population is very mobile. According to "A Study of the
   Feasibility of Implementing a Statewide Process for Electronically
   Sharing Student Information" (a collaborative effort by the California
   Department of Education, Far West Laboratory for Educational Research
   and Development and the California Educational Data Processing
   Association, published October 1992), it is estimated in California
   alone that as many as 20% of the student population change schools
   annually.

   <p>Furthermore, according to the study, the current method for exchanging
   student records and reporting to state and federal agencies costs
   California a staggering $50 million each year. It's not only
   expensive, it's time consuming; the average time spent transferring a
   record using the current system is 24 days. [1]

   <p>Clearly what is needed are standards for the exchange of this
   information across a common network, such as the Internet. Using
   Electronic Document Interexchange (EDI), student records could be
   transferred across the Internet to other schools, as well as
   universities and community colleges. The time could be cut from weeks
   to seconds and the cost savings estimated are considerable; according
   to the above California study, the cost drops from the current average
   $15 per transferred record to $4. (And some people think that $4 is
   too high, that the cost could be mere pennies per record.) Indeed,
   with savings like these, a business case can certainly be made for
   installing a network infrastructure and a link to the Internet.

   <p>A project called SPEEDE/ExPRESS, the Standardization of Postsecondary
   Education Electronic Data Exchange/Exchange of Permanent Records
   Electronically for Students and Schools, is taking the lead in
   defining standard record formats, and is also working with schools,
   universities and states to implement pilot projects. The University of
   Texas is currently exchanging records in this fashion with the Austin
   Independent School District and is planning on adding other
   universities and schools. There are similar pilots in Arizona, Florida
   and California.

   <p>It will take some time before standards exist for a ubiquitous
   networked student record transfer system.But the Internet is serving
   in other administrative capacities. The Texas Education Agency
   (TEA)currently makes many documents available on-line on TENET,
   including calendars, legislative summaries, directories, forms and
   spreadsheets. The hard copy versions are also mailed to schools, but
   an increasing number of people are realizing they can receive the
   information much faster by downloading it from the network. TEA could
   save millions of dollars in duplication and postage by making these
   documents solely available via the network. Indeed, the State of Texas
   has estimated annual savings of $1.4 million based solely on access to
   TENET.

   <h>III. B. Professional Development

   <p>Many teachers are using the Internet for professional development.
   Consider the plight of specialized instructors, such as journalism or
   physics teachers. Many schools or school districts only employ one
   such teacher. As a result, the librarian or woodworking instructor
   often feels isolated and must become very self sufficient in areas
   such as curriculum and professional development. With a network such
   as the Internet, these teachers now have support groups; "places" a
   teacher can go to share ideas with and ask questions of others in
   their discipline, as well as download resources for use in the
   classroom.

   <p>For example, Pat Gathright, the journalism teacher at MacArthur High
   School in San Antonio, Texas, is a true believer in the benefits of
   networking and using the Internet. Ms. Gathright has a TENET account
   and uses it to collaborate with other Internet-connected journalism
   teachers across Texas and the US.

   <p>"I have the sole responsibility on my campus for the yearbook,
   newspaper, Journalism I, and Photojournalism," she says. "Few of my
   fellow teachers can come close to understanding what my job is like or
   help me with some of the problems I face each day. But know that I can
   log onto the Internet and share with my journalism friends across the
   state a desktop publishing trick that I learned at a workshop, a place
   to find information on a story my students are working on, or just
   news about my day." [2]

   <p>Before TENET existed, journalism teachers like Ms. Gathright met once
   a year at their annual conference in Austin. Now many TENET-connected
   teachers meet online 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

   <p>Many teachers are using the Internet to coordinate projects with
   classrooms in other countries. For example, Helen Bell, the school
   librarian at Lincoln Junior High School in El Paso, Texas, has been
   corresponding with Taichi Kameyama, a professor at Gifu University in
   Japan who has assisted in coordinating projects between a local
   Japanese high school and Lincoln. Juliette Avots from Wellesley High
   School in Massachusetts also works with teachers in France to develop
   structured language projects.

   <p>In addition to collaborating with colleagues and developing joint
   projects, teachers can also engage in dialogues with field experts.
   Using the Internet, teachers can connect to NASA's Spacelink (operated
   by the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville Alabama) and send
   questions to space experts, including space shuttle astronauts.

   <p>Another project provided by the Educational Resources Information
   Center (ERIC), a US national information system, provides an
   Internet-based question-answering service for teachers, library media
   specialists, and administrators who have questions about K- 12
   education, learning, teaching, information technology and educational
   administration. Anyone involved with K-12 education can send an e-mail
   message to AskERIC and receive an answer within 48 working hours.

   <p>Teachers can also download useful information, guides and images for
   use in the classroom. Many are taking advantage of on-line Associated
   Press (AP) and Reuters newsfeeds, the daily CNN (Cable News Network)
   Newsroom curriculum guide, NASA space images, and regularly updated
   weather reports; all of these are easily accessible and available on
   the Internet.

   <h>III.C. Benefits for Students

   <p>One of the best publicized uses of the Internet is for instructional
   purposes. Children love computers and computer networks and there are
   lots of distance learning projects being conducted, ranging from
   electronic penpals to collaborative/comparison studies.One such
   project involved students from different countries comparing prices,
   packaging and contents of various products, integrating math, social
   studies, language and geography. (Most of the students were not even
   aware they were learning!) Other readily available information
   services are providing students with the latest in current events.
   Some of these include US White House press releases and briefings;
   Radio Free Europe reports; and UN News.

   <p>Rachel Weston, a 7th Grader at Georgetown Day School in Washington DC,
   wrote in a recent essay how the Internet has changed her life. "As I
   flipped through my e-mail messages one morning I suddenly received a
   new one entitled 'The Sydney Bush fires.' The mail was from my
   Australian keypal, and he was telling me and some of his other keypals
   what it was like to be experiencing the bush fires that were burning
   all round Sydney." [6]

   <p>Rachel goes on to describe the communication that took place between
   her friend and herself on Internet Relay Chat, his stories of the
   fires and how close they got to his house. In addition to the live
   reports, she clipped relevant newspaper articles. "However, all week
   long the information about the Sydney fires that I brought to current
   events in my social studies class was more up to date than anything in
   the newspapers,"she said.

   <p>This is a powerful demonstration of how the Internet creates global
   and cultural awareness, augments current events classes, and motivates
   students to write. However, keypal activities by themselves are not
   always effective and usually fizzle unless they are given more
   structure than just assuming students will be motivated to carry on a
   dialogue. Students need a theme for their communication with other
   keypals.

   <h>The Global Schoolhouse

   <p>Perhaps one of the most interesting uses of the Internet recently for
   education is the Global Schoolhouse Project. This project is one
   example of how the Internet can be used to transmit video for
   educational uses. Sponsored by the US National Science Foundation, the
   Global Schoolhouse was demonstrated during the US National Science and
   Technology Week in April 1993.

   <p>The participants in this "school without walls"

   were children ages 10 through 13 from four geographically distant
   schools -- Jefferson Junior High School in Oceanside, California;
   Cedar Bluff Middle School in Knoxville, Tennessee; Longbranch
   Elementary School in Arlington, Virginia; and Oldfield House School in
   Hampton, United Kingdom.

   <p>As part of their studies, the students spent six weeks prior to the
   event studying watershed pollution in their local areas. The
   curriculum was created by the FrEdMail Foundation (FrEdMail stands for
   Free Educational Mail Network), a non-profit organization devoted to
   creating and fostering meaningful distance-based projects using
   computer networks.

   <p>The students had an ambitious goal; to read Earth in the Balance by US
   Vice President Al Gore and then conduct ground-water pollution studies
   in their communities. Beginning three weeks before the demonstration,
   the students met in two weekly videoconference rehearsals over the
   Internet to give progress reports and show video clips of their
   research.

   <p>During the videoconferences, each group of students could see, in real
   time, all of the other groups and themselves on a quartered computer
   screen. For the demonstration event in April, US government officials
   in Washington, DC joined in the discussion, listening to the students'
   reports and asking questions.The students continued to meet in weekly
   videoconferences after the demonstration until the end of the school
   year; more meetings have been planned for the future.

   <p>During the Global Schoolhouse videoconference, a Sun Microsystems
   SPARCstation acted as a reflector, taking the video data from one site
   and reflecting it to the other three sites. A second reflector,
   located at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, sent copies of the
   video data to a viewing site in Vienna, Virginia, where guests could
   monitor the videoconference. The second reflector also sent the video
   data out over the Multicast Backbone, a collection of sites around the
   world that cooperate in global video and audio conferencing for
   various events.

   <p>During the videoconference, each desktop computer had a video camera
   and a projector connected to the monitor. The video camera fed the
   live action to the computer. Audio was provided by a traditional audio
   conference bridge. Cisco routers provided the main gateway between the
   LANs and the Internet and T1 or Switched Multimegabit Data Service
   (SMDS) lines provided access to the WAN.

   <p>The videoconferencing software, CU-SeeMe, is freely available on the
   Internet and is still currently being developed by Cornell
   University's Information Technology Organization (CIT). It allows
   one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many connections. A user can be
   either a receiver, or a sender and receiver. To receive, one only
   needs an Internet-connected Macintosh capable of displaying 16 grays.
   Sending requires the same plus a SuperMac VideoSpigot board, a camera,
   Quicktime and Spigot VDIG extensions added to the system.

   <p>Until recently, most participants in Global Schoolhouse projects used
   the message scrawl feature of CU-SeeMe or audio-conference bridges.
   Real-time audioconferencing software was released for the Macintosh in
   March 1994 and is publicly available over the Internet. (Please see
   the resources section at the end of this paper.)

   <h>III.D. Community Outreach

   <p>In addition to the administrative and educational benefits achieved by
   access to the Internet, there are advantages to providing community
   access to school resources. Some schools and network projects are
   encouraging parents to become involved and have offered access via
   dialup accounts to school systems.Homework assignment archives,
   schedules, calendars, lunch menus, etc. are just some of the things
   that can be made publicly available. Additionally, teachers are more
   accessible via electronic mail for parent/teacher conferences.

   <p>While community access is not as well defined or publicized yet, it is
   a crucial part of the educational and community building use of the
   Internet. Several schools are experimenting with providing low-cost
   accounts (to help pay for their networking costs) to parents and
   members of the surrounding community to provide access to local school
   information and the Internet.

   <h>IV. Barriers and Solutions

   <p>There's no question that the Internet is augmenting traditional
   classes with live data from distant lands and cultural exchange
   between children. Unfortunately, there are quite a few barriers
   preventing teachers and schools from making the connection.

   <h>IV.A. Internetworking Expertise

   <p>For one, there is a lack of internetworking technical expertise and
   vision. Frankly, it's hard enough for anyone these days to make heads
   or tails of the bewildering number of choices, and so it's
   understandable that schools are having problems figuring out which way
   to go. There's concern that committing to one distance learning
   solution will prohibit upgrading to future technologies.

   <p>There's also the confusion of how to establish a wide area connection.
   It's going to take awhile for us to fully understand how the
   convergence of the broadcast, telephone and computer industries is
   going to play out and who the players will be. In the US, both
   telephone and cable companies are promising connections and reduced
   rates in hopes of capturing the educational market.

   <p>There are many open system solutions, many standards and many vendors
   promising the "only"solutions. One organization called the National
   Center for Technology Planning (NCTP) is trying to help. Located at
   Mississippi State University, NCTP is providing network planning and
   direction to many schools and archiving technology plans on the
   Internet.

   <p>Other projects and studies provide some direction.For example, the
   state of California is drafting a Strategic Plan for Information
   Technology, which outlines a vision for the use of computer and
   communications systems in California schools. Part of this plan
   includes a Technical Model for School Networks guide. Another research
   study conducted by Bolt Beranek and Newman provided several current
   and future models for schools. The Internet Engineering Task Force
   Internet School Working Group is drafting a K-12 Internetworking
   Guidelines document, intended to provide technical guidance to the
   educational community on school networking and connections to the
   Internet. All of these documents are listed in the resources section
   of this paper.

   <h>IV. B. Existing Network Infrastructure

   <p>Perhaps the confusing technology and large number of choices is partly
   responsible for the next barrier:the lack of existing network
   infrastructure. A significant percentage of schools don't have local
   area networks in the computer labs. Therefore access to the Internet
   for the time being is limited to stand- alone machines with modems.

   <p>Unfortunately, because of the current practice of most states in the
   US permitting phone companies to charge business rates for telephones
   in schools, there are very few phone lines in the classrooms. It is
   necessary to educate the state public utility commissions (PUCs) about
   the benefits of access to the Internet via a phone in the classroom;
   indeed, there have already been several success stories in some states
   where regulation was introduced to lower costs for phone lines in
   schools.

   <p>But it's important to educate the school and district technology
   planners on the importance of scaling their networking solutions
   effectively. One phone line in a computer lab is a great start to
   demonstrate the benefits of the Internet. However, the computer/phone
   line/modem model doesn't scale well -- the cost of adding phone lines
   and modems increases significantly, but the bandwidth and increased
   access to resources do not. Dialup access is an easier solution to
   understand and implement initially, but ultimately harder for the
   end-user to learn, and more expensive to scale.Schools need to be
   educated on the internetworking model, that is, connecting networks to
   networks.Building a good local area network foundation is crucial.

   <p>In addition to a scalable local area network, schools will need to
   address the issue of administrating email accounts, newsfeeds, local
   information servers and other network-related configuration duties. A
   server that makes these tasks considerably easier, and integrates
   educational software in a distributed networked environment is the
   Copernicus system, developed by Bolt, Beranek and Newman in Cambridge,
   Massachusetts. There are a number of pilot sites which are using this
   server very successfully.One of these is the Ralph Bunche Elementary
   School in New York, NY. Paul Reese the Computer & Technology
   Coordinator, says, "We support some 350 e-mail accounts, a school
   Gopher, private and public newsgroups and are developing other
   services. The server sits on a LAN with approximately 70 Mac
   workstations. A recently installed 56 Kbps line now connects a
   neighboring middle school allowing them to use the server and share
   general network access."

   <h>IV.C. Funding

   <p>Another barrier is one of the oldest problems schools have faced; that
   is, funding for just about anything that is needed. This will continue
   to cause a problem until schools and districts establish visions and
   plans. Business cases can and are being made for administrative uses.
   Savings on educational tools such as textbooks will be realized as
   more and more on-line books are distributed electronically. Once
   differences are resolved and standards made for the transfer of such
   useful information, such as student records and books, it will be
   easier to allocate funds for network connectivity and access.

   <p>In the meantime, there are a number of sources for funds in the U.S..
   The National Science Foundation has an Internet Connections Program to
   which schools and organizations can apply for grants. The National
   Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) recently
   announced a grant program to fund planning and demonstration projects
   that (among other things) promote the goals of development and
   widespread availability of advanced telecommunications technologies
   and support the advancement of an advanced nationwide
   telecommunications and information infrastructure. Both the NSF and
   NTIA programs benefit other organizations, as well as universities and
   schools.

   <h>IV. D. User Applications

   <p>In addition to the bewildering amount of information and resources
   available on the Internet, there's also the perceived notion that the
   Internet is deliberately user hostile.

   <p>The Internet is growing up somewhat in this area with the wider
   availability of information discovery and retrieval applications, such
   as archie, gopher, Wide Area Information Servers (WAIS) and the World
   Wide Web (WWW). Most Internet-connected education networks offer at
   least a simple menu interface to the Internet. A graphical program
   called "Graphical Interface to Network Access" or GINA (formerly known
   as "The Guide") is currently under development by the California
   Technology Project and reviews of it are confirming its promise to be
   one of the easiest to use graphical interfaces to the Internet yet.

   <h>IV. E. Information Age Projects

   <p>And finally, another barrier to using the Internet in the classroom is
   motivating teachers to throw away the out-dated, incorrect textbooks
   and instead engage students interactively, exploring the Web for
   current events, real examples and the latest data.

   <p>True, the Internet has a little way to go before it can reliably serve
   as the sole digital lab or classroom, but there are plenty of useful
   projects going on right now where students are encouraged to use their
   creativity and common sense. The problem is that teachers need help in
   learning how to use this technology and how to apply it to teaching.

   <p>What is needed are more Internet evangelists, people that can simplify
   the technology and demonstrate the benefits. Currie Morrison, a
   Technology Coordinator at Nathan Hale High School in Seattle
   Washington is such an evangelist and has seen enormous benefits from
   her promotional efforts.She noted in a recent message sent to the COSN
   email discussion list, "My anecdotal experience has seen a large
   number of people impacted by what I have passed on to colleagues and
   students alike. Too numerous to mention."

   <p>Just as school technology coordinators and directors plan for networks
   and scalability, so must teachers plan for the use of technology in
   their classrooms.Too many advanced instructional learning systems are
   sitting gathering dust because of lack of planning in this area. More
   emphasis must be made by all network planners (administrative and
   technical)involved on training and motivation.

   <p>The Port Neches-Groves School District in southeast Texas has started
   an interesting project designed to motivate and assist teachers with
   transitioning to planning and developing classroom curriculum projects
   in an online world. Kay Abernathy, the technology coordinator, is
   pairing each teacher involved in the project with an online mentor who
   is located outside of Texas. Mentors will offer encouragement and
   assistance via electonic mail over the Internet to teachers who are
   just getting started in using the technology. The Port Neches-Groves
   teachers will keep journals which chronicle their progress and
   problems.

   <h>V. Conclusion

   <p>Despite barriers and challenges, the K-12 community is moving ahead.
   The K-12 community is considered one of the fastest growing groups
   involved in the Internet. This market is treading on the edges of
   technology and telecommunications; some schools have adopted
   technology for the classroom and distance learning projects with open
   arms, while others are just now starting to think about long range
   technology visions and plans.

   <p>The Internet promises more equitable access to resources for teachers
   and students, as well as saving time and money for administrative
   applications. We will continue to see growth and use of educational
   resources, increased coordination at all levels, and more
   user-friendly applications being developed.

   <p>It must be stressed that the Internet by itself is not a panacea for
   educational reform. The Internet can enhance classroom activities and
   professional development by creating global awareness, providing
   access to the latest information and enabling communication on a large
   scale, but you cannot just "throw" the Internet into a school and
   expect projects to magically occur. Most successful projects are
   carefully planned, and many of them occur mostly outside of the
   Internet. The Internet provides a motivational, enabling and
   empowering tool for education.
