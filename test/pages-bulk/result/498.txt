   <h>STEEL MANUFACTURING

   <h>SIGNIFICANT POINTS
     * <l>Employment is expected to continue to decline.
     * <l>Much steel production has shifted to the electric arc furnace,
       changing many jobs and enhancing opportunities for individuals
       with technical skills and training.

   <h>NATURE OF THE INDUSTRY

   <p>Few industries in the United States have changed as rapidly in recent
   years as the steel industry. As a result of new investment in
   equipment and worker training, this industry has gone from a seemingly
   moribund one, to one that leads the world in worker productivity and
   is the low cost producer for some types of steel. The U.S. steel
   industry still faces stiff competition, and employment is expected to
   continue to decline; but it is now in a more promising position to
   meet these challenges.

   <p>With new investments have come fundamental changes in the nature of
   this industry. The most significant change in the American steel
   industry is the development of the electric arc furnace (EAF),
   sometimes called the "minimill", which converts scrap metal from many
   sources-such as bridges, refrigerators, and automobiles-to steel. The
   term "minimill" originated from the relatively smaller size of these
   mills when they first appeared, compared with traditional integrated
   mills. Today, many EAF's or minimills are actually larger than
   integrated mills producing steel from raw materials. The smaller
   capital outlay required to start and operate an EAF has helped drive
   its growth. Moreover, scrap metal is found in all parts of the
   country, so EAF's are not tied as closely to raw material deposits as
   integrated mills and can locate closer to consumers. EAF's now
   comprise almost half of American steel production and their share is
   expected to continue to grow in coming years.

   <p>The growth of EAF's comes partly at the expense of integrated mills.
   Integrated mills produce iron in blast furnaces, from coal, iron ore,
   and limestone. The iron is then refined into steel, most commonly in
   basic oxygen furnaces. The steel produced by integrated mills
   generally is considered to be of higher quality than steel from EAF's,
   but because more steps are involved in the production process, it also
   is more costly. The initial step in the integrated mill process is to
   prepare coal for use in a blast furnace by converting it to coke. Coal
   is heated in coke ovens to remove impurities and to reduce it to
   nearly pure carbon. Because coke production is considered to be one of
   the dirtiest steps in production, many firms are looking for
   substitutes for coke in steelmaking.

   <p>At the other end of the steel manufacturing process, semifinished
   steel from either EAF's or integrated mills is converted into finished
   products. Some of the goods produced in finishing mills are steel
   wire, pipe, bars, rods, and sheets. Products also may be coated with
   chemicals, paints, or other metals that give the steel desired
   characteristics for various industries and consumers. Also involved in
   steel manufacturing are firms that produce alloys, by adding materials
   like silicon and manganese to the steel. Varying the amounts of carbon
   and other elements contained in the final product can produce
   thousands of different types of steel, each with specific properties
   suited for a particular use.

   <p>Increasing competition from abroad and in the domestic market has
   caused integrated and EAF producers to modernize. For workers, this
   often has meant learning new skills to operate sophisticated
   equipment. Competition also has resulted in increasing specialization
   of steel production, as various producers attempt to capture different
   niches in the market. With these changes has come a growing emphasis
   on flexibility and adaptability for both workers and equipment. As
   international and domestic competition mounts for U.S. steel
   producers, the nature of the industry is expected to continue to
   change in these directions.

   <h>WORKING CONDITIONS

   <p>Steel mills evoke images of strenuous, hot, and potentially dangerous
   work. While many dangerous and difficult jobs remain in the steel
   industry, modern equipment and facilities have helped to change this.
   The most strenuous tasks were among the first to be automated. For
   example, computer-controlled machinery helps to monitor and move iron
   and steel through the production processes, reducing the need for
   heavy labor. In some cases, workers now monitor and control the
   equipment from air-conditioned rooms.

   <p>Nevertheless, large machinery and molten metal can be hazardous,
   unless safety procedures are observed. Hard hats, safety shoes,
   protective glasses, ear plugs, and protective clothing are required in
   most production areas.

   <p>The expense of plant and machinery and significant production startup
   costs force most mills to operate around the clock. Workers averaged
   44.6 hours per week in 1998, and only about 1.7 percent of workers are
   employed part time. Night and weekend shifts are common, as is
   overtime work during peak production periods. In 1998, 33.7 percent of
   all steel workers put in overtime.

   <p>Cases of occupational injury and illness in the industry were 12.0 per
   100 full-time workers in 1997, significantly higher than the 7.1 cases
   per 100 workers for the entire private sector and also higher than the
   10.3 cases per 100 for all manufacturing. The highest injury rate in
   the steel industry-16.3-was found in steel pipes and tubes.

   <h>EMPLOYMENT

   <p>Employment in the steel industry declined to about 232,000 wage and
   salary jobs in 1998, less than half its 1980 level. The rate of
   decline, however, has slowed in recent years. The steel industry
   traditionally has been located in the eastern and Midwestern regions
   of the country, where iron ore, coal, or one of the other natural
   resources required for steel are found. Even today, about 50 percent
   of all steelworkers are employed in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana.
   The growth of EAF's, though, has allowed steel-making to spread to
   virtually all parts of the country. Large firms employ most workers in
   the steel industry. Over 9 out of 10 work in establishments employing
   at least 50 workers, and almost half work in establishments employing
   1,000 or more persons (chart 1).



   <h>OCCUPATIONS IN THE INDUSTRY

   <p>Opportunities exist in a variety of occupations, but the majority of
   workers-79 percent-are employed in operator, fabricator, and laborer
   and precision production, craft, and repair occupations (table 1).
   About 17 percent work in managerial, professional, and administrative
   support occupations.

   <p>At an integrated steel mill, production begins when material moving
   equipment operators load iron ore, coke, and limestone into the top of
   a blast furnace. As the materials are heated, a chemical reaction
   frees the iron from other elements in the ore. Blowers direct the
   overall operation of the blast furnace. Blowers are responsible for
   the quality and quantity of the iron produced and for supervising
   keepers and their helpers. Keepers operate the equipment used to tap
   the liquid iron and to remove impurities from the furnace. The molten
   iron then is ready to be transformed into steel.

   <p>Generally, either a basic oxygen or an electric arc furnace is used to
   make steel. Although the steel making procedure varies with the type
   of furnace used, the jobs associated with the various processes are
   similar. Melters supervise furnace operators and their assistants who
   control the furnace. Melters gather information on the characteristics
   of the raw materials they will use and the type and quality of steel
   they are expected to produce. They direct the loading of the furnace
   with raw materials and supervise the taking of samples, to insure that
   the steel has the desired qualities. Melters also coordinate the
   loading and melting of raw materials with the steel molding or casting
   operation to avoid delays in production.

   <p>Furnace operators use controls to tilt the furnace to receive the raw
   materials. Once they have righted the furnace, furnace operators use
   levers and buttons to control the flow of oxygen and other materials
   into the furnace. During the production process, assistants routinely
   take samples to be analyzed. Based on this analysis, operators
   determine how much longer they must process the steel or what
   materials they must add to meet specifications. Operators also pay
   close attention to conditions within the furnace and correct any
   problems that arise during the production process.

   <p>Traditionally, liquid steel was moved from the furnaces into a ladle
   from which it was poured into ingots. Steel producers now use a
   process known as "continuous casting" almost exclusively. Continuous
   casting allows firms to produce steel ready for the next step in
   processing directly from liquid steel, thus eliminating many of the
   steps involved in pouring and rolling ingots. Molding and casting
   machine operators tend machines that release the molten steel from the
   ladle into water-cooled molds at a controlled rate. Molded steel is
   then cut to desired lengths, as it emerges from the rolls. During this
   process, operators monitor the flow of raw steel and the supply of
   water to the mold.

   <p>The "rolling" method shapes most steel processed in steel mills. In
   this method, hot steel is squeezed between two cylinders or "rollers,"
   which flatten or shape the steel. Heaters monitor equipment that tells
   when the ingot is uniformly heated to the required temperature.
   Rollers operate equipment that rolls the steel ingots into
   semifinished product; the quality of the product and the speed at
   which the ingot is rolled depend on the roller's skills. Manipulator
   operators tend the machinery, which controls the position of the ingot
   on the roller. Placing the ingot and positioning the rollers are very
   important, for they control the product's final shape. Improperly
   adjusted equipment may damage the rollers or gears.

   <p>Millwrights are employed to install and maintain much of the
   sophisticated machinery in steel mills. As the technology becomes more
   advanced, they work more closely with electricians, who help repair
   and install electrical equipment like computer controls for machine
   tools.

   <p>With more sophisticated technology and demands for specialized
   products, scientists, engineers, and technicians have a significant
   role in the steel industry. For example, engineers test batches of
   steel before they are cast, to check for the desired composition. They
   also may develop new specialized metals as well as new equipment. As
   in other industries, there also are many managerial and administrative
   support jobs.

   <h>TRAINING AND ADVANCEMENT

   <p>As machinery becomes more complex, employers increasingly prefer to
   hire college graduates for highly skilled operating positions. For
   some production positions, vocational or community college training
   may be required.

   <p>Once production workers are hired, they receive training on the job.
   New workers entering the production process as lower-skilled laborers
   generally assist more experienced workers, beginning with relatively
   simple tasks. As workers acquire experience, they specialize in a
   particular process and acquire greater skill in that area. They may
   progress from second helper to first helper, and then to a skilled
   position, such as melter or roller. The time required to become a
   skilled worker depends upon individual abilities, acquired skills, and
   available job openings. It generally takes at least 4 or 5 years, and
   sometimes much longer, to advance to a skilled position. At times,
   workers change their specialization to increase their opportunities
   for advancement. Especially in EAF's, workers are trained to perform a
   variety of tasks and provide more flexibility to the firm, as company
   needs change.

   <p>Computers have become important, as companies have modernized. Workers
   must learn to operate computers and other advanced equipment. Although
   much of the specific training is done on the job, employers prefer to
   hire applicants who have completed formal classroom training in a
   technical school or college.

   <p>To work as an engineer, scientist, or in some other technical
   occupation in the steel industry, a college education is necessary.
   Many workers in administrative and managerial occupations have degrees
   in business or possess a combination of technical and business
   degrees. A master's degree may give an applicant an advantage in
   getting hired or help an employee advance.

   <h>EARNINGS

   <p>Earnings in the steel industry vary by occupation and experience but
   are higher than average earnings in private industry. Average weekly
   earnings of nonsupervisory production workers in 1998 were $822 in the
   steel industry, compared to $563 in all manufacturing and $442
   throughout private industry. Weekly earnings in blast furnaces and
   steel mills, at $907, were significantly higher than those in steel
   pipes and tubes, at $626. Earnings in selected occupations in steel
   manufacturing appear in table 2.

   <p>Union membership, geographic location, and plant size affect earnings
   and benefits of workers. In some firms, earnings or bonuses are linked
   to output. Workers receive standard benefits, including health
   insurance, paid vacation, and pension plans.

   <p>The iron and steel industry traditionally has been highly unionized.
   In 1998, 44.3 percent of steel workers were covered by union
   contracts, compared with 16.8 percent in all of manufacturing and 15.4
   percent in all industries. In some instances, companies are closed
   shops; that is, workers must belong to the union, in order to work
   there. EAF's, though, typically are nonunion. The overall decline of
   employment in traditional integrated steel mills and the growth of
   EAF's, together, have caused union membership to decline in recent
   years.

   <h>OUTLOOK

   <p>Employment in the steel industry is expected to decline by about 24
   percent over the 1998-2008 period. This decline can mostly be
   attributed to increased use of labor-saving technologies and
   machinery. Other factors affecting employment in the industry include
   foreign trade, overall economic conditions, the growth of EAF's, and
   environmental regulations. Despite the continuing decline in
   employment, qualified workers still will be needed to replace workers
   who retire or leave the industry. Opportunities will be best for
   individuals with the technical skills and training to handle
   technologically advanced machinery.

   <p>Employment levels in coming years will be greatly affected by the
   ability of steel makers located in the United States to compete with
   imports from abroad. Worker productivity has increased in U.S. firms
   in recent years, leaving the domestic steel industry better able to
   compete with imports. Many American steel producers, however, complain
   that they face unfair competition from abroad and that foreign
   producers, subsidized by their governments, are "dumping" steel in the
   U.S. market. Efforts currently are underway to improve trade relations
   in steel. If these efforts are successful, increasing trade would
   almost certainly result, which would foster growth in the most
   efficient American firms as they take advantages of growing export
   opportunities. It also would hasten the demise of inefficient plants
   trying to compete with low-priced imports.

   <p>Employment in the steel industry varies with overall economic
   conditions and the demand for goods produced with steel. For example,
   as the automotive industry produces more cars and light trucks, it
   will purchase more steel. In this way, much of the demand for steel is
   derived from the demand for other products. Other industries that are
   significant users of steel include structural metal products, motor
   vehicle parts and equipment, and household appliances. As many of
   these goods require a large outlay, consumers are more likely to
   purchase them in good economic times.

   <p>Steel companies, like most businesses, have entered the era of
   sophisticated technology. Taking several forms, this technology has
   improved both product quality and worker productivity. Computers are
   essential to most technological advances in steel production, from
   production scheduling and machine control, to metallurgical analysis.
   Computerized systems change the nature of many jobs, while they
   eliminate or reduce the demand for others. For example, computers
   allow one worker to perform duties that previously took the efforts of
   several workers. However, computer-controlled equipment often requires
   operators to have greater skills. Hence, workers who are comfortable
   with computers and other high-tech equipment-as well as those willing
   and able to learn-will be more widely sought after by employers. This
   automation will contribute to better opportunities for engineers and
   other professional specialty occupations, while causing significant
   declines for lower-skilled machine operators and inspectors.

   <p>Environmental issues also have affected the steel industry. Past
   decades have seen technological changes spurred by environmental
   emission regulations. Emission standards, under the present Clean Air
   Act, will likely result in costly modifications or shutdowns in many
   coal-processing facilities that employ a dirty, heavily polluting
   process. Necessary furnace modifications will require major
   investments and increase the overall cost of production for
   coke-producing plants. These modifications are, therefore, likely to
   raise costs in integrated mills that use coke to produce steel.

   <p>The emergence of EAF's is perhaps the most important factor in
   transforming the steel industry. This trend will continue in the
   foreseeable future, as EAF's dominate the new capacity expected to
   begin operation in the next few years. Integrated mills are expected
   to maintain a major share of the market in higher grade steel and are
   also entering areas like residential construction; but EAF's will
   continue to account for a larger share of the international steel
   market. Growth of EAF's is driven by many factors, including
   relatively low startup costs, flexibility, and the ability to locate
   close to the consumer. This is especially important in the
   construction industry. Because the scrap steel they need to operate is
   widely available, EAF's have provided job opportunities in the steel
   industry in additional geographic areas. However, since they generally
   have higher worker productivity, as EAF's capture more of the domestic
   steel market, fewer workers will be employed to meet the existing
   demand for steel products.
