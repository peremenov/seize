   <h>Calendar of past 2003 Chicago IDSA events:


   <h>IDSA Chicago Sketching Workshop: "Sketching for Communication"
   <h>March 6

   <p>Hosted by Brian Furlong, Newell @ Northwestern University.
   This workshop provided an introduction to drawing for design, focusing
   on rapid visualization and perspective sketching techniques.

   <p>IDSA Book Club - John Heskett's Toothpicks and Logos
   March 18 @ 6:30 PM
   led by Paul Hatch of TEAMS Design
   TEAMS Design
   1812 West Hubbard St, # 3A
   Chicago, IL 60622


   <p>Originally planned for December 2002, this book club review has been
   rescheduled once again for March 18th. It turns out the only two times
   we've gotten any real snow this winter have been the days book club
   was scheduled. We'll, we've decided to give this book one more chance.
   So, please come out and join us for some lively chat at TEAMS new
   location.

   <p>Note: Book Club is looking for their next book to review. If you have
   a book you've recently enjoyed, please bring it along for discussion.
   All are welcome.

   <p>After the previous books were wide-ranging in scope, it's time now for
   us to take an introspective look at our own profession with John
   Heskett's new book Toothpicks and Logos. The author of the 1981 book
   "Industrial Design" (an essential item on every self-respecting
   industrial designer's bookshelf) he now succeeds to define industrial
   design by reflecting it against modern contexts such as cultural,
   technological, environmental and corporate influences.

   <p>"Design is one of the basic characteristics of what it is to be human,
   and an essential determinant of the quality of human life." - a
   principle that nurtures his book as much as our profession.

   <p>If you don't make it there, then book is also available on-line at
   Amazon:

   <h>Chicago Fight Club
   <p>June 26 at Teams Design
   1812 West Hubbard St.
   7 pm

   <p>Building on the success of the Book Club, the Chicago chapter is
   setting up a new social event for Chicago Designers. Paul Hatch: "We
   found that the chief attraction of the Book Club is the social aspect
   of the meeting, which typically only briefly focuses on the chosen
   book. Discourse then ran the full gambit of topics."

   <p>Fight Club is a more targeted discussion, around a chosen topic of
   debate such as a film, TV show or current exhibition. The first
   meeting will be centered on the film Matrix Reloaded. Here, two
   volunteers will take extreme pro and contra angles to debate the
   merits and pitfalls of the film, the actors, and the genre. Everyone
   else can add their spice to the debate on either side.

   <p>First Rule of Fight Club: There are no debating rules.
   Second Rule of Fight Club: There can only be one winner.

   <p>Being able to articulate and defend your opinion is one of the most
   important skills a designer could have, and one that is rarely taught
   in school. Join us on June 26 for the very first IDSA verbal slugfest.

   collaborated with writers such as Paul Goldberger and Witold
   Rybczynski, artists such as Doug Aitkin and Justine Kurland, and

   <h>IDSA Chicago's Second FIGHT CLUB, November 20.

   <p>After the success of the first Fight Club we knew there had to be a
   follow up debate, so here it is: Sex and Violence.

   <p>Most of Europe and Canada have less than 100 mortalities per year
   through violence, whereas the US averages around 11,000 through guns
   alone. The US has also cornered the market in its pornography business
   and yet has one of the tightest restrictions on nudity on TV. Is it
   not also contradictory to blur out partial nudity while we can watch
   decapitations in full gory detail on primetime TV?

   <p>This no-holds barred `street debate' will cover these topics and also
   discuss the effects sex & violence has on TV viewers, what censorship
   does, etc.

   <p>What is Fight Club? Picture this:
   - <l>Two fighters under a spotlight, circled by 50 onlookers.
   - <l>One subject matter, two radically opposing opinions.
   - <l>Darkened empty loft space, multimedia backdrop.
   - <l>Angry questions, careful answers, and heartfelt arguments.
   - <l>One winner.

   <p>Two volunteers -the fighters- take extreme for and against stances to
   debate the merits and pitfalls of the subject. Everyone else adds
   their spice to the debate on either side.

   <p>First Rule of Fight Club: There are no debating rules.
   Second Rule of Fight Club: There can only be one winner.
