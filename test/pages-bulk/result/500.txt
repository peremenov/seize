 <h>American Government, Politics, and Law




   <h>Ben Field, 132 pages, Book #4067, $21.95

    <p>Roger J. Traynor served as a justice on the California Supreme Court
   from 1940 to 1970. During that time he gained a reputation as one of
   the nation's most innovative and influential judges. He wrote the
   first state supreme court decision overturning an antimiscegenation
   statute, he reformed family law and the doctrines governing divorce,
   he restructured the rules for police searches, and he caused the Court
   to adopt a strict liability standard in product liability cases. Using
   Traynor's opinions, primary and secondary sources related to those
   cases, Traynor's writings on the theory of judging, and oral history,
   this book examines Traynor's work and his influence.

               <p>Traynor's judicial philosophy stands out in the
   intellectual history of judging as an extreme. Few if any theorists of
   judicial decision making have so resolutely advocated innovation.
   However, unlike other activist judges of his era, Traynor often
   handled contentious issues with a minimum of controversy. Though his
   philosophy of judging was extreme, in practice, his style was so
   persuasive that most of his innovative decisions became
   institutionalized in American law.

              <p> Like the contemporary U.S. Supreme Court's "constitutional
   revolution," which expanded government regulatory power over the
   economy and created a new civil liberties jurisprudence, Traynor's
   innovative opinions committed the law to the equitable treatment of
   individuals with relatively little power. However, Traynor's success
   at gaining institutional acceptance for his judicial innovations
   depended in part on his sensitivity to the arguments against activism.
   His rationalist style set apart his brand of activism and gave it a
   tone of objectivity. Despite the controversy surrounding judicial
   activism, his adroit articulation of the public interest in legal
   reform made his opinions widely influential.

   <h>Mark R. Killenbeck, ed., $26.95

    <p>After two centuries of interpretive debate, four leading scholars
   bring essential insights and a fresh perspective to this difficult
   question. While the conclusions they derive are not consistent, the
   powers of their arguments enrich the dialogue. New chapters in this
   story will flow from a Court that will continue to examine these
   issues and refine its holdings. As part of that process, the Court and
   those interested in its work would do well to reflect on the ideas
   found here.



 
   <h>Robert A. Kagan, Martin Krygier, and Kenneth Winston, eds., $29.95

    <p>Philip Selznicks writings, which are still in progress, span over 60
   years and several disciplinary domains. He has been a major figure in
   each of the fields he has touched, and one of a very few to have been
   profoundly influential in them all. The fields where his works have
   been prominent include sociology, the sociology of organizations and
   institutions, industrial sociology, sociology of law, and moral and
   social (or public) philosophy.

               <p>The 23 essays in this important new book are not acts of
   reverence. They take off from Selznick, but that is not where most of
   them land. Many of them are critical, some of them sharply so. Many
   develop important and free-standing contributions to the areas of
   scholarship with which they are concerned. Yet no one can read them
   without recognizing that something very important has motivated them.

               <p>The volume does not begin to exhaust the ways in which
   Selnicks work is fertile, but its chapter indicateby their variety of
   approach, by the different things that they take from Selznick, by the
   many directions in which they show this thought can be fruitfully
   extended, and by their criticismswhat a remarkable achievement, and
   what a rich lode still to be mined, it represents.


   <h>Nelson W. Polsby and Aaron Wildavsky, 340 pages, Book #NEL9261, $24.95
   <p>"With the exception of V.O. Key's Politics, Parties and Pressure
   Groups, it is
   difficult to think of any other book in the history of American
   political science that has gone through so many new editions over such
   an extended time span and with such consistently high quality. What
   still sets this book apart from its competitors is its sense of
   perspective: about how day-to-day strategic decisions are affected by
   the institutional environment, about how the dynamics of presidential
   elections fit into the larger picture of American national
   government."

   <p>Americans dissatisfied with their political institutions look
   abroad--especially to the United Kingdom--for a model. Waltz asks

   British government is no better than American government at protecting
   national interests.

   policy as well) the American presidential system is superior to
   British parliamentary government....A worthy contribution to a great
   debate that now runs back at least a century to Walter Bagehot. In
   Waltz's hands the subject is still fresh, provocative, stimulating."--
