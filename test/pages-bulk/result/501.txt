<h>Where and How to Stand During Direct and Cross-Examination

   <p>Assuming the trial judge gives you the freedom to move around the
   courtroom, does it matter where and how you stand during direct and
   cross-examination?

   <p>During direct examination, many lawyers recommend standing near the
   far end of the jury box, which forces the witness to look at the jury
   when answering.

   <p>Is cross-examination any different? According to Steven Puiszis,
   President of the Illinois Association of Defense Trial Counsel, it's
   best to move around during cross-examination. That's according to
   Helen Gunnarsson's "Cross-Examination: Beyond the Perry Mason Moment,"
   in this month's Illinois Bar Journal--

     <p>Puiszis says that he paces around the courtroom during his
     cross-examination so that the witness will look at him and not at
     the jury. Doing so not only emphasized Puiszis's role as star but
     also further diminishes the witness's opportunity to gain
     credibility with the jury through eye contact.

   <p>What's the "role as star" business? During cross-examination, the
   cross-examining lawyer should be the main focus of the jury's
   attention. It's the complete opposite of direct, when the witness
   plays only a supporting role. During cross-examination, the jury's
   attention should be squarely on the questioning lawyer, who asks
   leading questions to which the witness can only answer yes or no.

<h>Technology Tip: Receive Faxes on Your Smart Phone

   <p>Though connected to email with devices like a BlackBerry or smart
   phone, lawyers might still have trouble receiving faxes when out of
   the office. Internet fax services like eFax can take care of the
   problem. For a modest fee, the company sends all your faxes to your
   email address as a pdf file. To do this, they'll also need to provide
   you with a new fax number, but you can simply set things up so that
   faxes to your current number are automatically forwarded to the new
   one. That way, you don't need to change your stationery.

   <p>Note: This tip was suggested by an article written by Allan Press for
   the 12/06 newsletter of the Illinois Bar Associations Standing
   Committee on Legal Technology. ISBA members may be able to access the
   newsletter here.

<h>Finding Other Law-Related Weblogs

   <p>There are two new legal blog search tools from Justia.com you might
   want to know about:BlawgSearch.com for legal weblogs and Blawgs.fm
   for law-related audio and video content.

   <p>If you want an introduction to these new tools, see the Justia weblog,
   where Tim Stanley has a long post explaining the site's Blawg
   Directory, Blawg Rankings, and more. There are already 48 law-related
   weblogs in the "trials and litigation" category, with other
   law-related weblogs being added each day.

   <p>That's a lot of useful, free information from lawyers who have no
   problem sharing their secrets with others--much more than when I
   started Illinois Trial Practice three years ago.

<h>What to Do When Your Cross-Examination Fails

   <p>What can you do when your cross-examination fails not because of your
   own incompetence, but because the witness is so, well, slippery?

   <p>One answer: During closing, talk about what happened. You might even
   call the witness a "greased pig."

<h>New Amendments to the Illinois Supreme Court Rules

   <p>The Illinois Supreme Court has made a pdf file of the new amendments
   to the Illinois Supreme Court Rules available online. The amended
   rules are 40, 213, 316, and 527; some of the amendments are effective
   immediately, and some not until January 1.

   <p>Litigators might be most interested in the amendments to Rule 213(g),
   which explain how an expert's trial testimony is circumscribed by the
   opinions disclosed in interrogatory answers and discovery depositions.
   The amendments are an attempt to make clear that an expert cannot
   disclose new opinions in an evidence deposition and then testify to
   those opinions live at trial. Opinions are to be disclosed before the
   evidence deposition, in an interrogatory response or a discovery
   deposition.

   <p>The amended rule reads as follows, with the new amendments noted in
   italics:

     <p>213(g) Limitation on Testimony and Freedom to Cross-Examine.

     <p>The information disclosed in answer to a Rule 213(f) interrogatory,
     or in a discovery deposition, limits the testimony that can be
     given by a witness on direct examination at trial. Information
     disclosed in a discovery deposition need not be later specifically
     identified in a Rule 213(f) answer, but, upon objection at trial,
     the burden is on the proponent of the witness to prove the
     information was provided in a Rule 213(f) answer or in the
     discovery deposition. Except upon a showing of good cause,
     information in an evidence deposition not previously disclosed in a
     Rule 213(f) interrogatory answer or in a discovery deposition shall
     not be admissible upon objection at trial.

     <p>Without making disclosure under this rule, however, a
     cross-examining party can elicit information, including opinions,
     from the witness. This freedom to cross-examine is subject to a
     restriction that applies in actions that involve multiple parties
     and multiple representation. In such actions, the cross-examining
     party may not elicit undisclosed information, including opinions,
     from the witness on an issue on which its position is aligned with
     that of the party doing the direct examination.

<h>New Frontiers in Electronic Discovery

   <p>It's likely you already think about email when drafting your
   e-discovery requests. But there are several other newfangled ways of
   communicating you might not think to consider--
     * <l>Web-based email;
     * <l>Instant messaging;
     * <l>Voicemail;
     * <l>Company-provided productivity tools;
     * <l>Portable storage devices.

   <p>According to forensic technologists David Sumner and Damon Reissman,
   these other communication tools are "often overlooked." To find out
   why this might be a mistake, read their article at Law.com,
   "E-Discovery May Target Unexpected Sources."

<h>Searching for the Law

   <p>In his article "What can Google do for you?" (Trial, 9/06), David
   Ratcliff suggests a number of Google-powered search engines that might
   be useful to lawyers, including these:


   <p>Ratcliff also reminds readers to try Google's advanced search options,
   which allow Boolean operators. There are still other suggestions in
   the article.

   <p>Extra-serious Google users should check out the book ,
   Google Hacks, which documents a number of useful but little-known Google
   capabilities.

<h>Closing Argument: Comparing Your Experts to Theirs

   <p>Juries in personal injury cases generally hear two versions of the
   medical facts, each presented by an opposing group of experts. If this
   isn't confusing enough, there's also testimony about the medical facts
   from the treating doctors, who may not agree with any of the experts.
   The treating doctors might disagree with each other too.

   <p>How can you help the jury sort it out? If the better set of experts
   and treating physicians is on your side, emphasize this point with a
   chart that compares your doctors and experts to their doctors and
   experts. Here are some points of comparison you might use:
     * <l>Where the doctors went to medical school;
     * <l>The doctors' board certifications;
     * <l>The doctors' research interests;
     * <l>The doctors' publishing history;
     * <l>The doctors' teaching experience.

   <p>In closing, you can use the chart to point out that the most qualified
   doctors and experts support your view of the case. Example: "You heard
   a lot in this case about a diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis, which was
   presented mostly through the testimony of Dr. Jones. Remember Dr.
   Jones? He's the doctor who said he's not yet board certified, though
   he's 'working on it.' Let's take a closer look at Dr. Jones--let's
   compare his credentials to those of Dr. Smith, who disagreed with him
   about the diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis. Dr. Smith should know
   about adhesive capsulitis. He's treated it every single day, day in
   and day out, for more than twenty-five years. He's published more than
   thirty articles specifically on the topic -- adhesive capsulitis has
   been his primary research interest since just after he graduated from
   Harvard medical school. Not only is Dr. Smith board-certified in
   orthopedic surgery, but he helps to write and administer the
   board-certification exam to new doctors and teaches orthopedic surgery
   to medical students. Now let's look at Dr. Jones. Dr. Jones isn't
   board certified, has never published on adhesive capsulitis, and has
   only done original research about knees, not shoulders. Although he
   treats shoulders in his practice, he's only been doing it for two
   years--no, sorry, only a year and a half, only eighteen months."

   <p>The example is a little over-the-top but you get the idea. Although
   the example relies on only a few points of comparison, there might be
   many others in any given case. Don't wait until your closing argument
   to start thinking about them. Instead, get into the habit of viewing
   the medical part of the case through a points-of-comparison lens. If
   you do, you'll automatically think about comparisons as you prepare
   the case, especially when you review C.V.s and depose the treating
   doctors and experts.

<h>Expert Depositions: The World's Shortest Outline

   <p>I knew a lawyer who used to say that expert depositions were extremely
   easy. "You only need to ask a single question," he'd say. "'What are
   your opinions?'"

   <p>Expert depositions aren't quite that easy. Even so, there's something
   about expert depositions that make lawyers want to boil them down to
   their bare essence. It's a sort of game, like trying to prove a math
   theorem in the fewest steps possible.


   <p>It's in this spirit that one should read a post at the Trial Lawyer
   Resource Center: "Expert Witness Deposition: Five Questions To Ask."
   Here's most of the post--


     <p>Expert's deposition. While there is no substitute for being
     prepared, you can take an effective deposition "on the fly" by
     remembering five essential questions and their logical
     subquestions:

     <l>1. Who engaged you in this case.
     <l>2. What they ask you to do?
     <l>3. What did you do?
     <l>4. What conclusions, opinions did you reach and what do you intend
     to testify to at trial?

   <p>It might be the world's shortest expert-deposition outline. Four
   questions plus a fifth I didn't include--to see it, you'll have to
   read the original post.

   <p>Is it a good idea to start an expert deposition with such a simple
   plan? If nothing else, the exercise of writing a very short outline is
   a helpful one, as it will force you to consider what's most important
   about the deposition.

   <p>I'll talk more about this idea in my third podcast on advanced
   deposition techniques, coming soon.

<h>Oral Argument Tips from Someone Who Does It a Lot


   <h>From Law.com: "Making the Most of Oral Argument," by Howard Bashman--


     <p>When I am representing the appellant, and thus am the first to take
     the lectern when the case is called for argument, I know that I
     will have at least a few moments of uninterrupted time before the
     onset of a barrage of questions. That time is best used to focus
     directly on the result I am asking the court to reach and the
     several reasons (to be covered in more detail during the argument,
     if the court allows) why the court should reach that result.

   <p>There's that and much more in Bashman's column. Read it before your
   next oral argument.

<h>All You Need to Know About Electronic Discovery


   <p>At Law Practice Today, Dennis Kennedy and Tom Mighell have a very
   useful article titled "EDD-ucating Yourself About Electronic
   Discovery." It begins like this--


     <p>It was back in  July 2004 when Tom published the first Strongest
     Links article on the subject of electronic discovery as part of an
     influential EDD-themed issue of Law Practice Today.  Since that
     time, the electronic evidence landscape has changed considerably,
     and EDD is more important that ever.  With December 1 -- the date
     the amended Federal Rules of Civil Procedure will take effect --
     fast approaching, we thought it would be a good idea to revisit
     those links, and provide an update to those of you who are still

<h>Admissibility of Medical Records as Business Records in Illinois

   <p>A recent case from the Illinois Appellate Court, Troyan v. Reyes (3d
   Distr. 9/29/06), contains a helpful primer for getting medical records
   into evidence without a doctor to sponsor them. Though plaintiff's
   counsel wanted to introduce medical records at trial, the doctors were
   not available to testify. As a work-around, plaintiff's counsel called
   the record keepers from the various hospitals and had them testify to
   the foundational requirements for business records, which are found in
   Illinois Supreme Court Rule 236.

     <p>Any writing or record . . . made as a memorandum or record of any
     act, transaction, occurrence, or event, shall be admissible as
     evidence of the act, transaction, occurrence, or event, if made in
     the regular course of any business, and if it was the regular
     course of the business to make such a memorandum or record at the
     time of such an act, transaction, occurrence, or event or within a
     reasonable time thereafter . . .

   <p>At trial, the record keepers testified to these foundational
   requirements. During closing, plaintiff's counsel wanted to publish
   the records to the jury. When the defendant objected, the trial court
   denied the request as to a radiology report and some of the other
   medical records that contained "observations, assessments, diagnoses
   and impressions of certain doctors."

   <p>On appeal, the Troyan court considered whether the medical records,
   which contained the opinions and diagnoses of absent doctors, should
   have been published to the jury under the business-records exception
   to the hearsay rule.

   <p>After setting out the foundational requirements for business records
   from Rule 236, the court made the following points:
     * <l>First, in order to introduce a record under the business-records
       exception to the hearsay rule, "it is not necessary that the
       author or creator of the record testify or be cross-examined about
       the contents of the record";
     * <l>Second, once a witness has established the foundational
       requirements, "the records themselves should be introduced";
     * <l>Third, these rules apply even to "diagnoses and opinions contained
       in medical records," which should be "admissible and published to
       the jury as a proper part of the business records exception to the
       hearsay rule";
     * <l>Fourth, there is an important exception: when the medical records
       either aren't relevant or are "too complex for the jury to
       understand on its own," then these rules do not apply and the
       medical records should not be introduced into evidence.

   <p>Applying these principles, the Troyan court held that the radiology
   report, which contained "complicated medical terminology," was "too
   complex and confusing to aid the jury absent medical testimony." Most
   of the other medical records were admissible, however, since the jury
   "could have easily understood the opinions and diagnoses contained" in
   the reports in that they did not contain "difficult medical
   terminology or opinions."

<h>The Illinois Supreme Court on Class-Action Waivers in Arbitration Agreements

   <p>In Kinkel v. Cingular Wireless, ____ N.E.2d ____ (Ill. 10/5/06), the
   Illinois Supreme Court held that an arbitration clause that prohibited
   class-wide arbitration was unconscionable.

   <p>The case began as an Illinois state-court class action in which
   plaintiff alleged that Cingular's $150 early-termination fee was an
   illegal penalty in violation of the Illinois Consumer Fraud Act.
   Plaintiff's agreement with Cingular included an arbitration clause
   with a class-action waiver, that is, a provision that "no arbitrator
   has the authority" to resolve class claims. Based on this clause,
   Cingular moved to compel arbitration solely on plaintiff's individual
   claims. The arbitration fee was $125. Cingular did not desire
   arbitration on a class-wide basis.

   <p>The trial court denied the motion to compel arbitration, holding that
   the class-action waiver was unconscionable and that the entire
   arbitration agreement unenforceable. After an intermediate appeal, the
   Illinois Supreme Court reviewed the case. The Supreme Court agreed
   that the prohibition of class arbitration was unconscionable. However,
   it also ruled that the class-action waiver was severable and that the
   arbitration clause could be enforced without it. The practical effect
   is that although Cingular can arbitrate the plaintiff's individual
   claims, it cannot preclude arbitration of the class claims, a result
   it was hoping to avoid.

   <p>The Supreme Court summarized its reasoning on unconscionability as
   follows:

     <p>In sum, we hold that under the circumstances of this case, the
     waiver on class actions is unconscionable. It is not unconscionable
     merely because it is contained in an arbitration clause. It is
     unconscionable because it is contained in a contract of adhesion
     that fails to inform the customer of the cost to her of
     arbitration, and that does not provide a cost-effective mechanism
     for individual customers to obtain a remedy for the specific injury
     alleged in either a judicial or an arbitral forum. We further hold
     that the offending clause is severable from the arbitration clause.

     <p>We do not hold that class action waivers are per se unconscionable.
     It is not unconscionable or even unethical for a business to
     attempt to limit its exposure to class arbitration or litigation,
     but to prefer to resolve the claims of customers or clients
     individually. Indeed, it has been suggested that, as a matter of
     economic theory, consumers may benefit from reduced costs if
     companies are allowed to engage in this strategy. See, e.g., J.
     Sternlight & E. Jensen, Using Arbitration to Eliminate Consumer
     Class Actions: Efficient Business Practice or Unconscionable
     Abuse?, 67 Law & Contemp. Probs. 75, 92-99 (2004). The
     unconscionability of class action waivers must be determined on a
     case-by-case basis, considering the totality of the circumstances.

   <p>At Workplace Prog Blog, Richard Bales has more, including thoughts
   about the article that was cited in the quoted portion of the Supreme
   Court opinion.
