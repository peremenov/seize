   <h>Comparing Two Versions of the Same Part with Pro/ENGINEER Wildfire 2.0
   and Pro/INTRALINK 3.4 
   <h>by Victor Gerdes, PTC Senior Product Manager 

   <p>Pro/INTRALINK can accurately track changes to Pro/ENGINEER files
   including the version, revision, and lifecycle, but cannot capture the
   types of changes within the Pro/ENGINEER model files.  For example,
   there may be meta-data, geometry, drawing, or cosmetic changes between
   two file versions that is not tracked at all. To determine the
   difference between two Pro/ENGINEER file versions, you can either
   manually compare the Pro/ENGINEER models or ask the designer who made
   the changes to point out the differences between the two models.  Both
   of these methods are time consuming and risky.

   <p>Pro/ENGINEER Wildfire 2.0 has the ability to compare two part files
   and provide a fast, precise, error-free report identifying the
   differences.  Part comparison and difference reporting allow you to
   understand exactly what has changed between two Pro/ENGINEER part
   files.

   <p>Whats more, with Pro/ENGINEER Wildfire 2.0 and Pro/INTRALINK 3.4, you
   can achieve even better part comparison and difference-reporting to
   highlight and detail the differences between two parts.  You can
   compare:
     * <l>A part from a Workspace with a part in the Commonspace
     * <l>A part from disk with a part in the Commonspace
     * <l>A part from a Workspace with a part from disk

   <p>You can also compare two versions of the same part or two different
   parts.  When you compare two versions of the same part, it is
   necessary to enter a replacement name when opening the comparison
   part, since Pro/ENGINEER does not allow two models with the same name
   in session.

   <p>You can format the difference report to show any combination of the
   following types of changes:
     * <l>Metadata
     * <l>Geometry
     * <l>Drawing
     * <l>Cosmetic

   <p>The steps for comparing two versions of the same part in Pro/ENGINEER
   Wildfire 2.0 with Pro/INTRALINK are as follows:

   1.       <p>Start Pro/ENGINEER Wildfire 2.0 linked to a Pro/INTRALINK
   workspace either by:

   o         <l>Launching Pro/ENGINEER, then registering Pro/INTRALINK as
   your server.

   o         <l>Set Pro/INTRALINK as Primary Server and choose the Active
   Workspace you want to work with.

   Or

   o         <l>Launching Pro/ENGINEER from a Pro/INTRALINK browser with the
   workspace you want to work with.

   2.       <p>Retrieve a part into Pro/ENGINEER.  The first part will be
   referred to as the Base Model.  For example, in Figure 1, the base
   model is 0001_COMP_4.PRT.

   3.       <p>In Pro/ENGINEER Wildfire 2.0, click Analysis > Compare > By
   Feature. The File Open dialog box opens.

   4.       <p>Choose File | Open  or select the Pro/INTRALINK cabinet icon
   in the Folder Navigator to browse your Pro/INTRALINK Commonspace for
   the comparison model. Locate and retrieve the second part you want to
   compare.

   o         <l>If you want to compare the same part, select the latest
   version of the part that is currently in session and click Open.

   o         <l>Because the part that you are opening has the same name as
   the object in session, the Version Conflict dialog box opens. Enter a
   replacement name for the part and click OK. The system saves the
   comparison model under the specified file name.

   <p>In Figure 2, we compare the latest version of the same part,
   0001_COMP_4.PRT, and give it a replacement name of PRT0001.PRT.

   <p>Note: Each of the two Pro/ENGINEER parts will appear in a separate
   window.  The Base Model will be in the active Pro/ENGINEER window.

   5.       <p>Pro/ENGINEER will generate and display the Model Comparison
   report in the Pro/ENGINEER Wildfire browser as shown in Figure 3.

   <p>The Model Comparison report displays the name of the base model and
   its version, and the name of the comparison model and its version.  If
   you provide a replacement name for the comparison model, the Model
   Comparison report will display the original name of the comparison
   model.  In Figure 3, the Base Model name and the Comparison Model name
   are the same, 0001_COMP_4.PRT, as shown in Figure 3.

   <p>By default, the Model Comparison report will display all the change
   types. The Filter Change Types option in the difference report allows
   you to configure the report to display only the change types you want
   to see.  Check the box next to each Change Type of interest, choose
   Apply, and the Model Comparison report will display only the selected
   changes types.

   <h>Change Type

   <h>Description

   <h>Metadata

   <p>A difference in the value of a system or user defined parameter

   <h>Geometry

   <p>Addition or removal of a feature or a difference in a features
   dimensions

   <h>Drawing

   <p>Differences related to views, geometric tolerances, notes, or sections

   <h>Cosmetic

   <p>A change in a cosmetics, such as color


   <p>For further information about a Geometry change, you may:

   ·         <l>Highlight an affected feature by clicking the triangle icon
   in the column under the Base Model or the Comparison Model.  Selecting
   the triangle icon will cause the affected feature to be highlighted in
   the window of the affected model.

   ·         <l>See feature information on an affected feature by clicking
   the info icon and the feature information will be displayed in the
   browser.

   <p>Note: If you want to compare an earlier version of a part with the
   latest version of the part, you must first retrieve the earlier
   version into Pro/ENGINEER as your base model.  Then you can retrieve
   the latest version of the model for comparison.

   <p>Summary.  Pro/ENGINEER Wildfire part difference analysis currently
   supports comparing two parts.  Comparison of assemblies, drawings, and
   family tables is not supported with Pro/ENGINEER Wildfire 2.0 but is
   planned to be available with the next release of Pro/ENGINEER
   Wildfire.


   <p>When choosing the comparison model, Pro/ENGINEER Wildfire will
   retrieve the latest version of the selected file.  This is useful when
   trying to identify the changes you made to a model that you checked
   out and worked on in Pro/ENGINEER.


   <p>Pro/ENGINEER Wildfire part difference analysis is also available with
   Windchill PDMLink.
