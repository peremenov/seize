<h>community education

<p>Subtitled 'being a description of the work of residential and
non-residential colleges for adult education', this 1938 publication from
the Educational Settlements Association provides a useful overview of
activity at that time.





    <p>This 1938
   pamphlet gives an insight both into the work of local educational
   settlements and national adult colleges. Of particular interest here
   is the account of the influential work undertaken in 'special areas'
   (mining areas where there was high unemployment). It also provides us
   with a brief overview of the Association itself. 

   <p>The Educational Settlements Association (founded in 1920) consisted of
   29 settlements and seven residential colleges at the time of this
   publication (they are listed in the appendix). Most of the 
   in membership were non-residential.

   Mark Freeman - .

   [page 1] DURING the last thirty years a new educational development
   has been taking placethe growth of Residential and non-Residential
   Colleges for adult students, or what is more generally known as the
   Educational Settlement Movement. The idea of the Movement is that of
   education in community and in it many people have found a deep and
   abiding interest and concern. Because of its value and infection it is
   now shared by a very much wider public than formerly.

   <p>The assertion of truth, the unveiling of illusion, the dissipation of
   hate, the enlargement and instruction of mens hearts and minds are
   some of the indispensable and urgent duties and services of our time
   and all true citizens should be identified with them. For many, I feel
   sure, the effective medium for the discharge of these duties and the
   fulfilment of these services is to be found in the Movement with which
   this pamphlet is concerned.

<h>Community education

   <p>[page 2] The age in which we live has been described as the golden age
   of applied science, the millennium of social facilities. The
   development of industry, the amazing progress of scientific invention,
   and the increasing dominance of the machine over life, both in work
   and in leisure, have profoundly influenced the moral, spiritual and
   intellectual attitude and outlook of all, and have reset the problem
   of human worth and conduct.

   <p>Universal elementary education, the flooding of new knowledge through
   hitherto undreamt of channels, the demands upon attention and interest
   through cinema, advertisement and daily Press, and the fascination of
   speed and the desire to be on the move , are factors which have gone
   deeply into our lives and have made it imperative that we should take
   serious stock of our situation if we are to preserve the unity of our
   lives as individuals and as a people, let alone break new ground in
   the experiment of living.

   <p>The resistless spirit of man has driven him forth to discover the
   utmost limits of the objective worldto sail its mighty oceans, climb
   its highest peaks, sound its depths and mount its heavens, master its
   stubborn resistance and exploit its material resources. The quest has
   been unremitting, eager and thrilling, but it has not been concerned
   with what matters most, namely, a true human motive, a sufficient end
   for all its stupendous tasks and efforts.

   <p>Indeed, what is coming to be seen with no small measure of alarm is
   that means have been regarded as ends , that things have been thought
   of as something worthy in themselves, and that human beings may be
   sacrificed to them; that unless a worthy human purpose or use can be
   found for them the opportunities and inventions of the scientific age
   may prove delusive and destructive of man.

   <p>Whilst man has been absorbed in the discovery of the remote countries
   of the world he has neglected to press forward in the discovery of
   that hidden country in the mind and spirit. There is so much of this
   terra incognita lying undiscovered in ordinary men and women, and its
   unveiling is so important both to us and to society at large, that the
   penetration of it and becoming at home in it is one of the imperative
   necessities of our time.

   <p>Who , says Fuller, hath sailed about the world of his own heart,
   sounded each creek, surveyed each corner, but that there still remains
   much terra incognita in himself? It is the discovery of this terra
   incognita that is civilization, and it is one of the functions [page
   3] of education to bring it about, not only in the exceptional person
   but in the ninety and nine, in the ordinary everyday average man and
   woman.

   <p>It is this service of discovery of the inward man , this search for a
   true knowledge of ourselves, this reaching up to the full stature of
   manhood and womanhood, this blending of the spiritual and the
   intellectual in a unified personal life, this dedication to a worthy
   human ideal, that is implied in the word education, and that is our
   important business. It cannot be imparted to children even by the best
   of teachers; it cannot be given to adolescents; but it can and must be
   achieved by men and women in fellowship of understanding and corporate
   dedication to the search for true knowledge, in a united determination
   to serve the noblest conception of life yet bequeathed to man.

   <p>This Community Education is the purpose of the Educational Settlements
   Association through its Residential Colleges and Educational
   Settlements.

<h>The Association

   <p>The Association is a voluntary organization for adult education. It
   was founded in 1920 and to-day comprises seven Residential Colleges
   and twenty-nine Educational Settlements or non-Residential Colleges.
   For directory, see pages 15 and 16.

   <p>Status. The Association is a Responsible Body under the Board of
   Education Adult Education Regulations for the purpose of submitting
   formal classes and receiving grants in respect of them.

   <p>Finance and Management. The Association is governed by a Council
   composed in the main of representatives of the constituent
   institutions affiliated to it. It is maintained from voluntary sources
   and for the purposes outlined in this pamphlet administers funds
   entrusted to it by Educational and other Trusts.

   <p>Scholarships and Bursaries. The Association awards annually a limited
   number of bursaries to men and women wishing to proceed to one or
   other of the Residential Colleges for a course of full-time study.
   Also from time to time it awards travel bursaries for students.

   <p>Affiliation. Among the conditions of affiliation to the Association
   are: (1) That the College or Settlement must have a Governing Body and
   in the case of a Settlement a student membership which is represented
   on the Governing Body. (2) That the education given must be non-party
   in politics and non-sectarian in religion.

   <p>Consultation and Advice. The Association is a clearing house for
   information concerning various aspects of Settlement [page 4] and
   College work and of vacancies and opportunities arising in connection
   with them. Interviews with prospective workers in the movement are
   arranged and because of its extensive and varied experience the
   Association is competent to give advice on questions relating to the
   kind of training and initiation needed for it.

   <p>Contact with the Wider Movement. The Association keeps in effective
   touch with its constituent bodies by representation on their
   respective committees and councils, by the holding of regular meetings
   of representatives and other members of Colleges and Settlements, by
   the regular visitation by the Secretary and members of the Executive
   Committee and by the arrangement of Conferences.

   <p>Co-operation in the work of the wider movement of Adult Education is
   effected by representation on such bodies as the Adult Education
   Committee of the Board of Education, the Workers Educational
   Association, the National Central Library, British Drama League,
   National Adult School Union and other kindred organizations.

   <p>The Association is responsible for the administrative and publicity
   work of the Joint Committee for Residential Adult Education which was
   set up to bring together the Residential Colleges and the Supplying
   Bodies in Adult Education. This Committee is composed of
   representatives of the University Extra-Mural Boards, the Trades Union
   Congress, the Central Joint Advisory Committee on Tutorial Classes,
   the Workers Educational Association, Association of Education
   Committees and the Residential Colleges.

   <p>Literature. The Common Roomthe journal of the Association is published
   three times yearly. The purpose of this journal is for the interchange
   of news and opinions each term among all who are interested in the
   work of Educational Settlements, Residential Colleges and the wider
   movement of Adult Education.

<h>The residential colleges

   <p>A body of students sharing a common life under a common roof with
   their own tutors, their own lectures and classes, Residential their
   own library and common room, their own societies for discussion and
   for sport and recreationthe residential college is a unique and
   valuable feature of the older English universities which is rarely
   found abroad, and is only partially realized in the mens and womens
   hostels of the newer universities in this country.

   <p>To bring an opportunity for at least one year of continuous study
   under such conditions to working men and women of adult years (the
   ages range from nineteen to sixty, with an average between twenty-five
   and thirty is the aim of the Residential Colleges for Workers which
   have sprung up during the present century.

   <p>There are now seven colleges of this type. The oldest is Ruskin
   College, Oxford, founded. in 1899. The youngest is Newbattle Abbey,
   near Edinburgh, founded a year ago.

   <p>Ruskin College is open to both men and women students for either one
   year or two years. Second-year students may enter for Diploma
   examinations in the University of Oxford, and the lectures and
   libraries of the University have been generously put at the disposal
   of the students. The College is governed by representatives of the
   Trades Union Congress General Council, and of other working-class
   organizations, together with three University advisers . Students for
   the most part come by means of scholarships or grants provided by
   Trade Unions, Educational Trusts, or Local Education Authorities.

   <p>at Bournville, Birmingham, was modelled on the Danish
   Folk High School, and has the advantage of access to the lectures and
   other facilities of Woodbrooke and the other Selly Oak Colleges.
   Avoncroft College, near Bromsgrove, is specially designed for
   agricultural workers, and combines cultural and vocational interests.
   Hillcroft College, Surbiton, is the only working womens college. Coleg
   Harlech is a Welsh foundation, though not exclusively confined to
   Welsh students. All these colleges are recognized for grant by the
   Board of Education, and are affiliated to the Educational Settlements
   Association, in which they form a Colleges Group.

   <p>These colleges aim at providing selected adult students with the
   opportunity of continuous study, unhindered by the many obstacles
   which confront the worker-student living at home [page 6] scanty or
   scattered leisure, lack of privacy and quiet, and the pressure of
   private engagements or public work.

   <p>They present many advantages which the Tutorial Classes or the W.E.A.
   course in a locality cannot giveregular weekly private tuition,
   association with several tutors, a wide range of subjects, easy access
   to books and guidance in reading, as well as the enrichment of
   intercourse with fellow students of diverse occupations, from
   different parts of the country, and sometimes from overseas.

   <p>And what happens to students after they have left the colleges? In
   earlier and more prosperous times the most of them would return to
   their occupations and localities, there probably to engage in
   educational, social, or political work among their fellows. But to-day
   there are many who seek for new openings and callings,, either because
   they cannot find work in their previous occupations, or because they
   are anxious to find more congenial work.

   <p>Among the students, for example, several have entered on fulltime
   educational work with the W.E.A. or the Co-operative Movement, others
   have been engaged as research officers in their trade unions, others
   elected to Parliament, while not a few have qualified for special
   forms of social service, such as probation work, and one or two are
   parsons. Recently, a number have found a useful place as leaders in
   the Educational Settlements and Community Centres that have sprung up
   in the Special Areas, or on new housing estates.

   <p>But the results of residential adult education are not to be measured
   in terms of easily recorded after-careers, or achievements in public
   life; the most significant results are the imponderable ones that take
   place in the mind and spiritthe expansion of interest, the growth of
   character and insight, the loosening of prejudices and strengthening
   of principles.

   <p>The collection of students sayings in Learn and Live bears witness to
   the fruits that may be, though they are not always, gathered from the
   life at college. He put my hand on a new latch, says one student of
   his tutor. And another says quite simply: He introduced me to myself.

   <p>It would be difficult to find a better phrase to describe one of the
   most important effects of college life. For, after all, there are many
   men and women who have never really been introduced to themselves, or
   who are not on good terms with, or at home with, themselves. The first
   effect of self-acquaintance may not always be encouraging. We discover
   our prejudices and our limitations of knowledge or capacity. But the
   recognition of ignorance is, as Socrates maintained, the beginning of
   wisdom; and the education which so begins may pass into the highest
   form of education, which is the conversation with a mans best self .
   And this kind of self-knowledge and self-communion is bound up with a
   [page 7] better understanding of the other man and of the community in
   which we live, so that the student who has come by it is like to be a
   better parent, a better companion, and a better citizen.

   <p>We do not seek nor expect perfection; we see frequent failures and
   failings back; but all of us who are engaged in residential Adult
   Education are encouraged to continue by the happy knowledge of men and
   women whose lives have been enriched, if not transformed, by the
   gradual process of growth in knowledge, wisdom, humour and good
   humourof growth, in fact, in grace.

<h>Educational Settlements Non-residential Colleges for Adult Education in
normal areas

   <p>Any attempt to describe a Settlement in a normal area must overcome
   the difficulty of definition: what is a Settlement and what is a
   normal area? For the purpose of this article a normal area must be
   understood as an urban area, neither special nor distressed , with a
   fair provision of community services such as health, technical and
   post-school education in general. What a Settlement is in such an area
   will, I hope, be clear by the time this article is concluded.

   <p>It is always easy to say,
   first, what a thing is not, and therefore it may be as well to say how
   a Settlement differs from both a W.E.A. tutorial class and a local
   authoritys evening institute. W.E.A. tutorial classes will be found in
   Settlements, and some Settlements are affiliated to evening
   institutes. Moreover, some institutes, especially those provided by
   the London County Council, are the equal in range and social life, and
   mote than the equal in equipment, of the best of Settlements. Where is
   the difference?

   <p>As is generally known, the principle of the W.E.A. is to form a
   tutorial or other class where the members of the class require it, in
   church hail, school, settlement or working mens club. By contrast the
   Settlement houses a variety of activities in the one building. On the
   other side, however vivid may be the social life of a London Literary
   Institute, its programme, staffing and general control are in the
   hands of a statutory authority: the principal, for example, cannot be
   dismissed by the students. In a Settlement, however, it is possible
   for the individual student, with [page 8] his or her fellows, to have
   a preponderating share in the government of the Settlement, to appoint
   the staff, to decide the educational and general policy and generally,
   through an executive, to be responsible for the detailed life of a
   community which may include as many as six or seven hundred men and
   women.

   <p>So much for definition by contrast. Now, what would you find on
   entering a Settlement? Inside on the notice board there would be the
   schedule of the days, or more generally the evenings, activities.
   These might include an economics class, folk dancing, a rehearsal for
   a Shaw play, German literature and practical wireless construction.
   The number of activities is necessarily determined by the size and
   adequacy of the premises. From the entrance hall it is usually not far
   to the common room. This should be, and in most Settlements is, truly
   a common room. It ceases to be one when rehearsals or committee
   meetings are allowed to encroach. After classes are over the embryo
   philosophers and folk dancers, economists and German scholars,
   together with others not bent on any special activity, meet and talk
   there. A canteen is provided, and tongues can wag, gently lubricated
   by tea, coffee or lemonade, until 11 p.m., or whatever is the official
   closing time. A library is housed either in the common room or
   elsewhere. For the rest, the enquirer will find class rooms, a lecture
   hall and workshops, together with, in many Settlements, the private
   rooms of the resident wardens.

   <p>Much has been written of things so far. What is happening to persons.
   here? Well, in the first case, there is space in the Settlement,
   colour and light, and many who come there lack these in their homes.
   There is freedom. In the Settlement the individual man or woman may
   become significant. The man is no longer a lodger, tolerated by an
   inhospitable landlady. The woman is no longer merely a wife dare it be
   said?surrounded by housework and the care of children. A good many
   young parents take it in turn to come to the Settlement, in order that
   neither shall be wholly tied.

   <p>There is not only freedom; there is grace. You only achieve
   significance by making yourself acceptable to your fellows. On first
   joining the Settlement you may discover pain, the pain of contrast.
   Settlements are not places to stave off revolution. But the discontent
   stands a chance of becoming transformed through righteous indignation
   into positive social effort by the fellowship of varied souls, whose
   experience may range from that of a county court judge or city
   engineer to that of a coachbuilder or factory hand. The intellectual
   discipline of the tutorial class is allowed to impress the passive
   play-reader. Folk dances keep the earnest Marxist human, and Christian
   and Atheist are able to meet together in a community which is salted
   with humour. [page 9]

   <p>Most of the work is done in the evening, but there is a considerable
   and growing amount of work being done in the day with shift workers,
   unemployed, and married women. It is not only classes which are
   organized. In most Settlements there are strong dramatic groups; one
   has twice been in the finals of the British Drama League for the whole
   of England. Settlements have often taken a leading part in forming
   Youth Hostels, in focusing public opinion on the school-leaving age,
   nursery schools and other local government matters.

   <p>All educational settlements are affiliated to the Educational
   Settlements Association, which is a responsible body recognized by the
   Board of Education. Classes submitted through the E.S.A. or the W.E.A.
   are inspected by the Boards inspectorate. In addition, many local
   authorities give block grants to Settlements and a corresponding
   amount of registration and inspection follows again.

   <p>The majority of Settlements receive a grant from the E.S.A., ranging
   from ten to thirty per cent, of the total income; the balance is made
   up of students fees (in one Settlement these range from is. 6d. to
   7s., according to the class, and the years entire programme may be
   taken for a composition fee of 12s. 6d.), grants in aid from the Board
   of Education and the local authority, local subscriptions, and the
   special efforts, such as garden parties, of the students themselves.

   <p>The staff will vary from place to place. There is always a full-time
   Warden or joint Wardens, with occasionally a sub-Warden. The remainder
   are part-time tutors, taking their special subjects. They may be
   wholly occupied with similar work, as are the majority of W.E.A.
   tutorial class tutors, or they may be engaged on quite other work.
   There is in one Settlement, for example, a Post Office official who
   conducts an English literature class which has achieved renown. Many
   groups, especially those which are not limited by statutory
   requirements, will be staffed and organized by students themselves.

   <p>Cardinal Newman once wrote: If, then, a practical end must be assigned
   to a university course, I say it is that of training good members of
   society. Its art is the art of social life and its end is fitness for
   the world. The Settlement is concerned not only with the decent use of
   leisure but with the very art of living, and the words of Newman may
   not unjustly be adopted as its aim.

       <p>What I claim is liberal education: opportunity, that is, to have
     my share of whatever knowledge there is in the world according to
     my capacity or bent of mind . . . and also to have my share of
     skill of band which is about in the world, either in the industrial
     handicrafts or the fine arts.

<h>In special areas

      <p>TheSettlements which have grown up in the mining valleys of South
     Wales since 1927 are making a contribution to the cultural and
     social life of the communities they serve which may fairly be
     described as unique inasmuch as they have been able to continue, in
     a way hardly open to any other type of organisation, the provision
     of expert advisory services in a variety of social activities with
     the maintenance of that close personal relationship and concern for
     people in whose midst they are situated, which is the
     distinguishing mark of Settlement work.Report of the Commissioner
     for the Special Areas in England and Wales for the year ended
     September 30th, 1937. 

   <p>A number of palliative and practical efforts have been made in the
   Special Areas in the hope of mitigating the severity and
   demoralization of the conditions which poverty and uselessness have
   imposed upon many thousands of homes. One of the most significant has
   been the establishment of Educational Settlements of which there are
   eight in South Wales, one on the north-east coast of County Durham,
   and one at Maryport in Cumberland.

   <p>The first and obvious needs met by these efforts were physical. Visits
   to the homes of some of the miners revealed the desperate struggle
   going on, not only to feed the family, but in many cases also to hide
   the poverty that had overtaken them. Steps were taken to meet such
   needs as far as funds would allow.

   <p>But if the physical condition was serious the mental condition was
   even more serious, and there was as deep a need for an understanding
   sympathy as for material help.

   <p>In the situation we are thinking of the people had been used to work,
   to a consuming occupation which demanded their physical strength and
   occupied their minds, but after the General Strike many thousands of
   them found themselves with nothing to do from morning to night, week
   in, week out, and in place of a regular wage a meagre allowance from
   Public Assistance. Next, therefore, to trying to meet the barest
   physical needs was the imperative necessity [page 11] of something to
   meet the mental and spiritual demands of their lives, and it was this
   which led to the first Settlement in South Wales.

   <p>As an outcome of consultation with those who had experience of
   Educational Settlements in normal areas a house, Maes-yr-Haf, was
   taken and the experiment began of educating people to make good use of
   their otherwise useless hours and days.

   <p>At Maes-yr-Haf it was recognized from the outset that sympathy becomes
   mere sentimentality unless it has a practical expression, and that the
   spiritual life of a people is inseparably linked up with education in
   the broadest sense of that word. Therefore an attempt was made to find
   work for idle hands to do as well as to provide food for the mind.
   Cobblers shops, equipped with the necessary tools and leather, where
   unemployed men could mend boots and shoes for their dependants and
   also for school children, were among the first and successful efforts.
   Later came the development of mens clubs in which meals were provided
   and pieces of public work undertaken by unemployed men, by arrangement
   with the local authorities. The clubs had workshops and tools where
   men could learn to make simple furniture and mend their own household
   necessities. Skilled instructors were available, and at one time there
   were as many as forty such centres in different parts of the South
   Wales valleys.

   <p>The starting of Adult Schools, and informal classes in a variety of
   subjects, and of a little school of weaving for women and girls at the
   Maes-yr-Haf Settlement, opened the way to new friendships and wider
   contacts. The weaving school was a great success and brought many
   women and girls into touch with beautiful work.

   <p>On the side of educational class work the Settlement provided
   competent lecturers in subjects that were close to the peoples
   interests. Although all the classes held, and they were many, were
   informal, the standard set was a high one. Time has shown that this
   provision was in direct line with the needs of the people, because the
   educational classes and lectures have grown from 9 in 1927 to 78
   classes and 420 single lectures in 1937, and the students from about
   200 in 1927 to over 1,000 in 1937. The Settlement staff, which began
   with two, to-day consists of twenty-four, including lecturers and
   instructors in Economics, Biology, Music, Psychology, Handicrafts,
   Drama, Play Centres, Physical Training, and Recreation.

   <p>This first experiment worked like leaven, and soon attempts were made
   to adapt it to the needs of other areas. Following close upon its
   found2tion was the opening of a Settlement at Merthyr Tydfil, and an
   original piece of work was begun at Dowlais. A little later Oxford
   House, Risca, was opened, and was followed by Bargoed Educational
   Settlement in 1934. [page 12] In 1936 by one at Aberdare and another
   at Pontypool. Plans are in hand for a further one at Pontypridd, which
   it is expected will be in full work during this winter. In the North
   of England a new Settlement was opened in Seaham Harbour in 1930, and
   the latest development is one at Maryport in West Cumberland, opened
   on September 22nd, 1937.

   <p>Of the development in South Wales Sir Percy Watkins, formerly of the
   Board of Education, says: Each Settlement serves its own area, usually
   a mining valley with a population varying from 50,000 to 130,000, and
   from this significant fact there has grown, perfectly naturally, a
   somewhat unique result, namely that each Settlement is not merely a
   central meeting place for its associated clubs and groups and
   individuals, but is also a power-station from which emanates guidance
   and advice.... A South Wales Settlement is therefore a natural unit of
   organization within its area for any form of social service which
   depends for the value of its contribution upon a recognition of the
   cultural and social needs of that area as a whole. . . . These focal
   points are institutions which in the midst of all our changing social
   problems stand for something abiding and permanent and stable...."

   <p>An account of this kind would be incomplete unless some reference were
   made to the wider movement throughout the country which has been made
   possible by the Special Area Fund and the interest and sympathy of the
   Special Commissioner, Sir P. Malcolm Stewart, and his successor, Sir
   George M. Gillett. This fund, administered mainly through the National
   Council of Social Service, has been used to try to meet the greater
   need throughout the country and has been applied in a variety of ways
   and with varying degrees of success. There is no question, however,
   that those who were responsible for the administration of that fund
   availed themselves of the ideas that were being worked out at
   Maes-yr-Haf and in other Settlements.

   <p>One thing must not be overlooked, and that is that the Educational
   Settlement in Special Areas did not begin with any orthodox conception
   of what a Settlement should be, but only with the intense desire to
   meet a very serious and demoralizing human situation, and an open mind
   as to how that could be done. There now seems little doubt that the
   thing was right in its inception, and that the life of thousands of
   people has been effectively reached.

   <p>Moreover, as time has gone on and it has become more clear that a very
   large section of the mining community will never return to the one
   occupation of which they have competent knowledge, and that they will
   never have the chance of beginning life anew in some other district or
   in some other occupation, the Settlement is destined to play a
   permanent part in their lives.
