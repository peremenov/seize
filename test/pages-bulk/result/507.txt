    <h>SPEECH BY THE MINISTER OF LABOUR, MMS MDLADLANA, ON THE OCCASION OF
     THE TABLING OF AMENDMENTS TO THE SKILLS DEVELOPMENT ACT, National
                        Assembly, 17 September 2003

   <p>Madam Speaker, honourable members, I am deeply grateful for the
   opportunity to place before this House; the Skills Development
   Amendment Bill for consideration and adoption. It is the first time
   that I am asking this august House to amend this piece of legislation
   that was first passed in 1998. In the five years that have passed
   since this law was passed literally millions of people have been
   trained under its banner. Many of these people have been the workers
   who keep our economy running in all the mines, offices, shops and
   factories of our nation. With the training they have received we
   believe that the productivity and competitiveness of their workplaces
   has been improved as well as their own employment security and
   prospects. In addition, hundreds of thousands of unemployed people
   have also been trained - young and old - trained to find work in the
   formal labour market, to create their own income generating
   opportunity or to participate in social development projects that aim
   to improve the lives of their communities and the Households that
   constitute it. The skills revolution that the legislation was intended
   to unleash is indeed well underway.

   <p>The Amendments set out to remedy the challenges that have had to be
   faced in the process of implementation.

   <p>Whilst many of the achievements that I have just alluded to are the
   product of the hard work on the part of many of the Sector Education
   and Training Authorities or SETAs as they are called, it is a matter
   of public record that some of the SETAs have not worked well. Allies
   and opponents alike have forcefully brought the problems to the
   public's attention because they are concerned to see every cent
   collected under the Skills Levy for training delivery being spent
   properly - and certainly not wastefully or fraudulently. I agree
   completely with this view. It has been patently painful for me to
   watch with paralysis; incidences of poor performance, inadequate
   accountability and in some instances - financial impropriety. In a
   country where the rule of law reigns supreme, I can only exercise
   powers, which have been conferred to me by law. The current law does
   not allow me to adequately intervene and address matters that many of
   you have correctly complained about in relation to the operation of
   SETAs.

   <p>My first response was to highlight this problem to our social partners
   whose representatives sit on the governing boards of these SETAs. I
   was thrilled when the social partners accepted the challenge and made
   the commitments they did at the Growth and Development Summit. You
   will remember that both business and labour said that they would
   ensure that their representatives to the SETA Boards are at a
   sufficiently senior level to take meaningful decisions and provide
   strategic direction, and that they would ensure that they are
   adequately prepared for this responsibility. Hopefully in future they
   will stand to account when problems arise - and I will not have to
   take the heat alone! After all I do not sit on the Board of any SETA!

   <p>However, I must accept that ensuring that the Skills Development Act's
   purposes are achieved is my responsibility. And in summary, the
   central reason for the amendments are to give me the right to fix the
   problems that have arisen, so that the skills revolution can
   accelerate a pace without being drawn back by the negative publicity
   that the bad apples inevitably attract.

   <p>When considering the changes to the law I had a choice, I could
   attempt to remedy each and every problem as it arose or I could
   clarify my expectations of good, efficient performance and
   transformatory practice for all SETAs and then put in place procedures
   to target those who deviated from this. I have chosen the latter
   course. I felt that the former course would lead to an ad hoc set of
   prescriptions, which would increasingly skew the playing field in ways
   that would eventually undermine the universal training agenda we are
   trying to put in place.

   <p>So you will see in these amendments a new obligation on all SETAs to
   enter Service Level Agreements with the Department of Labour that
   clearly set out performance outcomes, and very clear steps should any
   SETA fail to meet its obligations in terms of these agreements. For
   example, I shall have the power to instruct SETAs to remedy a problem,
   and if they fail to do so, then this will itself constitute grounds
   for the take over of their administration.

   <p>Some feel, I know, that giving me the power to set salaries for staff
   and allowances for Board members is 'going too far' - that this is
   Board responsibility. But again, let me say, that the need for this
   intervention arose in response to the public outcry about these
   matters, and where the social partner representatives on SETA boards,
   who had the authority to set reasonable standards in this regard from
   March 2000, failed to do so. However, to those who are concerned that
   I will exercise this power in an arbitrary way that interferes with
   the performance of SETAs need not worry. It is precisely in order to
   promote SETA performance that I am introducing these measures and so a
   fair balance will be found, following a fair and transparent process.

   <p>There are other changes to the Skills Development Act that have been
   occasioned by other implementation problems. In regard to private
   employment agencies for example, there are those of you in this House
   that will recall the case that was highlighted in the media last year
   - in which it was found that young women were being recruited by
   unscrupulous private employment agencies from the rural areas with the
   promise of domestic work in Cape Town. They were ferried to town in
   taxis that they were later expected to pay for, kept in barrack-like
   conditions and then hired out at extremely low rates of pay. Most of
   the agencies engaged in this practice were not registered with the
   Department of Labour but ambiguities in the legislation made it
   unnecessarily difficult to close them down. The proposed Amendments
   put the matter beyond doubt. All private employment agencies will be
   expected to be registered - and will only be registered if they comply
   to decent work practices - and their failure to do so will undoubtedly
   lead to their closure. I salute those in the private sector employment
   agency industry who have supported this measure - demonstrating their
   commitment to 'clean up' this industry.

   <p>Not all the amendments are solving negative problems however. I will
   highlight just two positive measures that are being introduced to
   accelerate the implementation of the skills strategy: the first
   enables me to establish a national standard for people development in
   organisations. We are all by now familiar with SAQA that rewards
   individuals who achieve qualification outcomes registered on the
   National Qualifications Framework. The new standard will enable me to
   recognise organisations that demonstrate good skills development
   practices. The National Skills Authority together with my Department
   has been piloting the Investors in People standard - and already
   sixteen workplaces have been recognised. These organisations will be
   individually recognised at the forthcoming Skills Development
   Conference next month. I hope that we will soon become a nation of
   organisations that commit themselves to achieve this standard.

   <p>The other positive measure that these Amendments are introducing is
   Employment and Skills Development Agencies. These Agencies are
   intended to accelerate the uptake of learners in learnerships by
   taking from smaller employers and even non-governmental agencies all
   the 'hassle' of the administration side of learnerships. There will be
   no reason for any firm not to take on learners after this amendment.
   Indeed I support the call of the National Youth Commission that every
   single employer should have at least one learner. Only on this scale
   will we be able to achieve both our Growth and Development target of
   72 000 learners by May next year and the National Skills Development
   Strategy target of 80 000 by March 2005.

   <p>There are other amendments of a technical nature that bring this
   legislation in line with the Public Finance Management Act and provide
   for the funding for the administration of the National Skills Fund
   from its own resources. This provision will provide the department
   with much needed capacity to support the SETAs and monitor their
   performance in advancing the interest of the skills revolution. I
   trust that all honourable members who are committed to the objectives
   of the skills revolution will support these proposed amendments and
   also do their bit within their spheres of influence to ensure that our
   skills revolution become a resounding success.

   <p>I thank you
