   <h>Plurality and Majority

   <p>In order to win a plurality, a candidate must receive a greater number
   of votes than anyone running against him. If he receives 50 votes, for
   example, and two other candidates receive 49 and 2, he will have a
   plurality of one vote over his closest opponent.

   <p>However, a candidate does not have a majority unless he receives more
   than 50% of the total votes cast. In the example above, the candidate
   does not have a majority, because his 50 votes are 50% or less than
   the 101 votes cast.
   <h>Presidents Elected Without a Majority

   <p>Fifteen candidates (three of them twice) have become president of the
   United States with a popular vote less than 50% of the total cast. It
   should be noted, however, that in elections before 1872, presidential
   electors were not chosen by popular vote in all states. Adams's
   election in 1824 was by the House of Representatives, which chose him
   over Jackson, who had a plurality of both electoral and popular votes,
   but not a majority in the electoral college.

   <p>Besides Jackson in 1824, only three other candidates receiving the
   largest popular vote have failed to gain a majority in the electoral
   college--Samuel J. Tilden (D) in 1876, Grover Cleveland (D) in 1888,
   and Al Gore (D) in 2000.

   <p>The "minority" presidents are listed below.
