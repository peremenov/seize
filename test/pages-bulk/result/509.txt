<h>Vouchers: cessations and surrender: cancel returned CIS24 vouchers on CIS
system (A)



<h>CANCEL RETURNED CIS24 VOUCHERS ON CIS SYSTEM

   <p>This action guide explains the steps you should take to record CIS24
   vouchers surrendered to the Revenue as cancelled on the CIS system.

<h>CAUTION

   <p>Remember that changing the status of the returned vouchers from
   'Valid' will mean that they are treated by the CIS System as having
   been 'used'. As a result, subject to the 'Minimum Stock Level' being
   reached, this action may trigger the replenishment process and a
   further issue of vouchers. Because of this you should always bear in
   mind the reason for voucher cancellation and amend the subcontractor's
   details or Voucher Profile Band in order to prevent the automatic
   issue of further vouchers either in error or bearing incorrect
   details.
   <p>The action guide is presented in two parts as follows
     * <l>To cancel individual vouchers, follow the steps at A below

     * <l>To cancel a range of vouchers, follow the steps at B below

   <p>For physical cancellation of the vouchers, see the action guide listed
   in the menu.
   <p>A. CANCEL INDIVIDUAL VOUCHERS
   <p>1) Select `File' from the CIS Main Menu.
   <p>2) Select `Manage Vouchers' from the File Menu
   <p>3) Select `Single voucher' from the Manage Vouchers menu

     <p>You should now be at the `Voucher Serial Number' window.

   <p>4) Key in the voucher serial number for the voucher you want to cancel
   and click on the [OK] button

     <p>You should now be at the `View Voucher Details' window.

  <p> 5) Click on the [Cancel Voucher] button.

     <p>This should take you to the `Voucher Cancellation' window.

   <p>6) Click on the 'Status' field to reveal a list of three possible
   statuses to change to
     * <l>lost

     * <l>stolen

     * <l>spoilt

   <p>7) Click on 'Spoilt' (or other option). It should then appear alone in
   the box.
   <p>8) Click on the `Effective From' box and key in the date of receipt of
   the voucher.
   <p>9) Select the 'Reason for Cancellation' from the list provided. This
   action will enable the [Save] button.
   <p>10) Click on the [Save] button to store the change.
   <p>11) This action will result in the display of a final warning message
   confirming that the change of status is irreversible
     * <l>Click on [Yes] to receive the message 'This change has been saved
       and the voucher will be cancelled overnight'.

   <p>The overnight batch process will update all the voucher and stock on
   hand records. This will have the effect of reducing the minimum stock
   level of vouchers held by the contractor and, unless there is a system
   stop on voucher issue, trigger automatic replenishment.

   <p>1) Select `File' from the CIS Main Menu.
   <p>2) Select `Manage Vouchers' from the File Menu.

   UTR. For a concern, enter the UTR of the concern.
   <p>5) Click on [OK]
   <p>If the subcontractor also acts as a contractor, you should be at the
   `Contractor/subcontractor Selection' window. Click on the
   [Subcontractor] button.
   <p>If the subcontractor is a concern with more than one cardholder, you
   will be presented with the `Cardholder Selection' window. Click on the
   cardholder to whom the vouchers were issued and click on the [OK]
   button.

     <p>You should now be at the `Voucher selection criteria' window.

   <p>6) Click on the CIS24 box in the `Select Voucher Type' area of the
   window and select the 'Y' by clicking on it.

     list of ranges of vouchers issued to the subcontractor.

   and click on the [Cancel Range] button.

     <p>This should take you to the `Voucher Cancellation' window.

   level of vouchers held by the subcontractor and, unless there is a
