<h>Urgent Surgery Is Not Always Necessary To Treat Stroke Caused By Brain
Haemorrhage



<h>28.01.2005

   <p>The results of a major international Medical Research Council (MRC)
   trial, undertaken in collaboration with the Stroke Association, show
   that early surgery is not always the best treatment for one of the
   commonest and most lethal forms of stroke. The results of the trial,
   published in this weeks edition of The Lancet, will help doctors
   decide the best way to care for patients with the condition.
   Supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is a type of stroke
   caused by the spontaneous rupture of a blood vessel in the brain and
   there has been much uncertainty about the best way to treat it.
   Anecdotal evidence suggests that early surgery to remove the resulting
   blood clot limits damage to the surrounding tissue and improves
   recovery by allowing the blood to circulate more freely. However,
   brain imaging studies to date have failed to provide conclusive
   evidence for or against this and previous clinical trials have given
   mixed results.

   <p>The MRC STICH* trial was specifically designed to answer this
   question. The scientists studied over 1,000 patients recruited from 27
   countries to find out if early surgery is better than careful
   observation.
   <p>The results showed no statistical differences in the number of people
   who died or the degree of disability in survivors between the two
   policies. However, those patients with blood clots near the surface of
   the brain were found to be more likely to benefit while patients in a
   coma seemed less likely to benefit from early surgery.
   <p>Patients were only eligible to take part in the trial if, on admission
   to casualty, a brain scan showed they had had an ICH in the last 72
   hours and if their brain surgeon was uncertain whether or not to
   perform surgery. In addition to the usual medical care the patients
   were randomly assigned to early surgery or careful observation with
   delayed surgery only if necessary.
   <p>Dr David Mendelow, from Newcastle led the trial. He said: The results
   will help us decide better how to manage patients with this type of
   stroke careful clinical observation and surgery can be life-saving but
   theres no need to rush in with an operation, except perhaps in those
   patients where the blood clot is significantly close to the surface.
   This type of clot should not be confused with the type of clot that
   occurs after an injury.
   <p>Dr Joanne Knight, Associate Director of Research and Development for
   The Stroke Association, said: The Stroke Association welcomes this new
   research which is the biggest ever neurosurgical collaboration and
   will have a significant influence on practice internationally. Were
   pleased to learn this research will now give consultants the evidence
   they need to decide on the best treatment for stroke patients. It will
   also mean that patients will not have to go through the stress of
   surgery unless its beneficial to their condition.
   <p>ICH accounts for a fifth of all stroke-related conditions. More than
   40 per cent of patients with ICH die and the majority of survivors are
   disabled.
