<h>prepare for life's events: changing/losing a job

<p>Changing jobs, even when it's your
   choice, can be unsettling. Losing a job can be devastating. Regardless
   of the details, you probably have some doubts about the future. Can
   you survive financially, and for how long? What do you do with funds
   from your previous employers retirement plan?

   <p>Evaluate all of the resources that are available to you. Do you have
   the necessary insurance coverage to protect yourself and your family?
   Although it may not be easy, think beyond the short term. Your new
   situation may impact your long-term investment strategies.^1
   Adjustments to your retirement plans or your childrens college savings
   plans may be required.

   Financial Group companies can help you take stock of your new
   circumstances.

   <p>What do you intend to do with your retirement plan assets at this
   time? You may want to consider rolling the assets in your qualified
   plan into an annuity-funded IRA. While funding your IRA with an
   annuity offers no additional tax-advantage, there are unique annuity
   features to consider. These include multiple investment choices,
   living benefits, death benefits, and the ability to create a stream of
   income you can't outlive.
                                                             

   <p>Whether you're finally pursuing your real interests or coming back to
   the work force after some time off, MassMutual's disability income
   insurance coverage offers the convenience of portability. No matter
   where you go or what changes in your life, your policy remains the
   same and stays with you even when you change jobs.
                                                             

   <p>Starting a new job may mean re-examining your insurance needs. If
   you're concerned about income replacement, a pay raise will mean you
   need more life insurance. Or maybe you've lost group life insurance
   coverage from your previous job and you need to replace that employee
   benefit with individual life insurance. If you find yourself
   unemployed in the future, owning individual life insurance can provide
   continued protection.
                                                       

   <p>Although you may experience unexpected career developments, your
   financial goals should remain steady. Mutual funds offer you the
   benefits of professional management and asset diversification that may
   help you reach your long-term financial goals.
                                                       

   <p>Guaranteed death benefits, living benefits and payment of lifetime
   income are contingent upon the claims-paying ability of the issuing
   company or companies.
