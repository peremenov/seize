<h>Not Even Wrong

<h>More Landscape Stream of Consciousness

   <p>It looks like particle theory has now degenerated to the point where
   its leading figures can't think of anything better to do than to write
   rambling articles with virtually no equations that reach no real
   conclusions. Last week was Lenny Susskind, tonight there's a new
   article by Michael Douglas.

   <p>His conclusion, such as it is, goes like this:

   <p>"If I had to bet at the moment, I would still bet that string theory
   favors the low scale, for the reasons outlined above, but it is not at
   all obvious that this is what will come out in the end.... We should
   keep in mind that `favoring' one type of vacuum or mechanism over
   another is not a strong result, if both types of vacuums exist..."

   <p>So, maybe string theory "favors" a low supersymmetry-breaking scale,
   maybe not. As usual, not only can't it predict anything, it can't even
   predict the scale at which it can't predict anything. I really cannot
   understand why anyone thinks this kind of thing is science.

       <p>Any bets on what string theory folks will be working on, if string
       theory falls out of favor and into hibernation like it did in the
       late 70's and early 80's? Any bets that somebody like Edward
       Witten would abdicate from string theory, and/or John Schwarz
       would continue slogging on with string theory to the day he dies?
       <p>Any bets on what the SUSY crowd will be working on, if SUSY falls
       out of favor too?
       <p>Apart from my very limited knowledge of particle physics history,
       I don't even have any clue as to what I could be working on if I
       was still doing particle theory, outside of SUSY and/or string
       theory. If I was a young naive grad student today, I would be
       tempted to go into something like astroparticle theory or possibly
       do an MBA or law school instead.

       <p>A lot of people are already abandoning particle theory for
       astrophysics, Steven Weinberg would be one prominent example. Many
       string theorists have moved into cosmology, often hoping there is
       something to be done there with string theory, my colleague Brian
       Greene is an example.
       <p>I hear my advisor (Curt Callan at Princeton) is mostly doing
       biology these days. A few people have moved into mathematics.
       <p>Presumably John Schwarz would be one of the last to give up on
       string theory. Witten certainly seems to continue to believe in
       string theory, something which mystifies me. He hasn't gone in for
       the anthropic nonsense, or for "string cosmology" or "string
       phenomenology". I'd bet he's well aware that the present state of
       string theory is such that progress can't be made in those areas.
       <p>I suspect the SUSY people will hang in there until data from the
       LHC comes in. If something interesting that isn't SUSY turns up
       there, they'll all jump on it.
       <p>Unfortunately the thing that seems to me the most sensible idea in
       the present circumstance, that of going back and trying to really
       understand the things one doesn't understand about gauge theories
       and the standard model, doesn't seem to have any takers. People
       have convinced themselves that there's nothing new to be found
       that way.

       <p>How popular is it for physics or math folks to go to Wall St.
       these days?
       <p>I knew many particle theory and some string folks that went the
       Wall St. route through the 1990's. Main drawback I've heard from
       old friends and colleagues is that there's a very high burnout
       rate on Wall St. with a half-life of around 6-7 years for many
       physics and math types.
       <p>Only other major "competitive" route I was aware of that many math
       and physics folks went to, was management consulting. Last I heard
       from friends and colleagues that went into consulting, many
       consulting firms (ie. Accenture, McKinsey, etc ...) were laying
       off folks like crazy in periodic "purges" over the last few years.

       <p>Weinberg in astrophysics - how nice.
       <p>I heard a talk a UMd on early string theory (the 26-dim weaving of
       it) by Gell-Mann. He opened his talk with a comment about the
       "half-asstrophysicists" in the audience. I wanted to punch him
       out. Instead I asked him an impromptu group theory question he
       could not answer extemporare, which was almost better.

       <p>Speaking as one who "sold out" and left particle physics to to
       work in Wall Street (the City of London, actually) - I feel it my
       duty to correct the bleak picture painted earlier of this career
       path. First off, if you choose to go into trading as did former
       string theorists Kelly Kirklin and Paul Miron then you can make a
       lot of money. I don't know the exact score with these two, but my
       guess is that they both have enough to retire. Kelly is now a
       post-doc at Cambridge. Whether he is paying for himself, or
       denying some much more deserving youngster by holding this post I
       do not know, but the point is that with plenty of money in the
       bank, he is now able to do what he wants, which is physics - a bit
       like the "gentleman scientists" of old, like Lord Rayleigh.
       Personally, I never went into trading, mainly because I find
       software far more interesting, but having said that, although I
       have not done nearly as well as these two, I nonetheless was able
       to pay off my mortgage about two years ago.
       <p>Some basic points that all physicists thinking of making this
       transition ought to be aware of:
       <p>= There is a lot of interesting mathematical work to be done in
       the Finance world.
       <p>= The route from science PhD to quantitative analyst in an
       investment bank is well-trodden & you will not have to explain or
       justify yourself. Mathematical skills are valued.

       <p>Chris,
       <p>Perhaps it was the folks I was speaking with over the years. These
       old colleagues in particular ended up quitting Wall St. after 6 or
       7 years, after getting sick and tired of trading or writing
       computer code that priced derivatives securities. I never asked
       them specifically what they defined as "burnout" in their line of
       work. My trading friends were always complaining about their work
       related stress, such as their telephone ringing every 30 seconds
       and having to keep track of information simultaneously on 5 or 6
       computer screens all day. The friends who did the computer
       derivatives calculations stuff had less complaints, other than
       many of them finding their work boring and/or not very interesting
       after awhile. In some ways I got the sense they felt their work
       started to become "routine" or a "chore" to them, and the initial
       "excitement" was gone for the most part.
       <p>Whether these folks chose the "wrong" profession to go into, I
       don't know for sure. Some thought the money would keep them happy,
       but in the longer term it didn't. Others I suspect saw the money
       as a "means to an end", where they were able to make a large
       enough fortune to "retire" and do whatever they wanted afterwards
       with the rest of their life.
       <p>Certainly none of them had any complaints about the money they
       were making. Every one of them were able to pay off all their
       student loan debts, as well as a large portion of their mortgages
       if they lived outside of Manhattan.
       <p>I have not kept contact with any of these old friends and
       colleagues over the last few years. So I don't know what they're
       thinking these days, or if they changed their minds about what
       they regard as "burnout". A few folks I'm aware of went back to
       writing particle and/or string papers while others literally
       "disappeared" without a trace.

       <p>Hello Chris,
       <p>I made two serious attempts to gain employment in the City (of
       London, banking and finance sector), about two years apart, and
       came up against a brick wall on both occasions - once as a new
       theoretical physics PhD, and once as a recent high energy physics
       post-doc. Despite advice to the contrary, I found it impossible to
       gain work as a junior `quant' (quantitative analyst).
       <p>I contacted many banks and finance firms, got advice from an
       economics university lecturer who was a former `quant' team
       member, and read up on as much financial mathematics and economics
       as I could. I couldn't even secure an interview! My CV was listed
       on quite a few specialist finance employment agencies, and I could
       get nothing. I was, and still am, baffled by the lack of interest
       my skills, which I assumed were valued by the finance sector,
       brought me.
       <p>After asking for feedback about this, I was told by employment
       agencies - who relayed what quant team leaders told me about my
       applications - that the reasons I was never shortlisted were: lack
       of experience in the financial world, too many other PhDs
       applications, and that my programming skills were not as extensive
       as other applicants. Well, if they wanted computer programmers,
       why did they give the impression that they wanted theoretical
       physicists - people who can work with and solve mathematical and
       modelling problems?
       <p>I think that there are, and have been, too many applicants for
       finance sector jobs who don't have enough programming skills, like
       myself, and who have also been misled about how much computer
       programming is required in these jobs. The aforementioned former
       quant told me that it would be about 75% of the time - is this
       true in your experience, Chris?
       <p>My impression (and I've seen job ads asking for candidates in this
       direction) is that, in the post-9/11 era, combined with the
       economic down-turn, economics and financial mathematics PhDs are
       the candidates more likely to be successful, as well as graduates
       who have worked as part of summer programmes with banks
       (internships/work experience), and even computer science PhDs.
       <p>So now I'll never get to see the `front office' or the trader's
       floors, nor be paid the fabled big salaries and bonuses of the
       City.

       <h>June 1st, 2004 at 3:16 pm
       <p>Hello erinj,
       <p>If there is less tolerance now for quants who don't program in the
       City, then I accept part of the blame. I have always argued that
       they should. The problem is that if bringing the model into
       production means involving a team of programmers to turn the model
       into something that can work in a production environment then the
       process will take too long, and as I probably do not need to tell
       you, traders are not patient people. The system we have at Nomura
       just involves deriving a (C++/COM) class from one called "Trade"
       and overriding some virtual functions. That way our quants can
       have a new trade type in the system on the same day (there is a
       bit more to it than that, but that is the basic idea).
       <p>We are now getting way off topic. Drop me an e-mail with your CV
       to chris.oakley@uk.nomura.com and I will see if I can come up with
       some suggestions.

       <p>I don't have a lot of information about what is happening to
       current particle theory PhDs, but a large fraction of the ones
       from my era (early-mid 80s) ended up working in the computer or
       finance industries (about equal numbers in each).
       <p>Over the last ten-fifteen years I've seen a lot of young math grad
       students and faculty leave academia, mostly for finance. Ten years
       ago the academic job market was terrible and it wasn't so hard to
       get a finance job. More recently the academic job market has
       improved, but finance jobs seem to take a lot more effort for
       people to get. One reason is that there are now a lot of financial
       math master's degree programs (we have a very successful one here
       in our department). So there are a lot of students coming out with
       some training and good credentials in financial math. It is harder
       for straight math PhDs without any experience in finance to
       compete with them.

       <p>One thing that is true of anti-bangers (and perhaps bangers) - one
       makes up his mind early, and tends to stick to that decision. e.g.
       I have always found the BB hateful, even before inflation which
       only made it much worse. There is too much "play" in GR for
       comfort, so the extrapolation to cosmic time scales is very
       suspect, the moreso since the entire idea of energy is on shaky
       ground - and so also time. Time is all balled up in GR no matter
       how you cut it. The following thought experiment illustrates - you
       can never "watch a movie" of the formation of a black hole - since
       you can't see anything beyond the horizon, that stuff can never
       have been "out here", from my perspective, and therefore a black
       hole cannot form in finite local time, and must have always
       existed, from my perspective. Now the problem here is not the
       horizon, but time itself - and it's just the other side of the
       energy problem. I cannot think of any counter-argument that allows
       a Big Bang. Time is more than duration, it's "persistence". GR is
       only complete when the substance - persistence - comes
       automatically out of the basic idea of curvature. That is, by its
       nature GR is a vacuum theory, and in fact the only part of it that
       is well-tested is Rmn = 0.

       <p>Peter,
       <p>How common is it for math or physics PhDs to go into computers
       ever since the dotcom bubble bursted a few years ago?
       <p>Almost everybody I know who still has a paying job in
       computer/hi-tech and even the defense sectors are paranoid of
       being laid off, especially with many jobs being "outsourced" to
       places like India or China. This seems to be almost universal from
       the folks who do data entry all the way up to PhDs who do the
       cutting edge research & development work, who are not in upper
       management. On the surface it sounds "suicidal" for a company to
       be firing many of their research and development folks just to
       save a few bucks in costs, or "outsourcing" their research and
       development work to countries which don't have much in terms of
       intellectual property laws and enforcement.

       <p>Since the bubble burst I don't know anyone who has gone into the
       computer industry. All the people I can think of who have left
       academia recently have gone into finance. Part of this may just be
       because I'm in New York, where there are lots of finance jobs and
       few computer ones. Maybe the experience of people on the West
       Coast is different.

       <p>Peter,
       What reasons do math/physics people have for leaving grad school
       or academia these days?
       <p>The main reasons I've heard of over the years from old friends and
       colleagues (excluding political or gross misconduct reasons), were
       involuntary ones like
       <l>- a grad student couldn't get a postdoc
       <l>- a postdoc couldn't get another postdoc and/or couldn't get an
       assistant professor job
       <l>- an untenured faculty member was denied tenure or couldn't get a
       tenured faculty job
       <l>- an untenured faculty member lost most of their grant funding
       (especially in the case of an experimentalist)
       <p>while voluntary reasons were ones like
       <l>- a grad student didn't like graduate school and didn't feel like
       it was worth the effort to finish their PhD research work
       <l>- a grad student got bored or sick of their field and quit after
       getting their PhD
       <l>- an untenured person got sick and tired of their field, and had a
       hard time getting any funding when they tried changing into
       another field (in some cases not even getting any funding at all
       in their new field)
       <l>- a postdoc felt they had no chance in hell of getting a faculty
       job, and subsequently quit
       <l>- a postdoc got bored or sick and tired of their field, and
       subsequently quit
       <l>- a tenured faculty member got sick and tired of cranking out
       meaningless "resume padding" type of papers just to maintain their
       research grant money; ended up quitting to find more greener
       pastures outside of academia
       <l>- a postdoc got sick and tired of cranking out tons of meaningless
       "resume padding" type of papers, with no end in sight (ie. the
       "permanent postdoc" types who are on their 4th, 5th, or higher
       postdoc); ended up quitting out of discouragement
   <h>15. Peter Says:
      <h> June 2nd, 2004 at 10:59 pm
       <p>I mainly know what happens these days with grad-students and young
       faculty in math. Very few grad students leave without getting a
       degree. When they graduate, some don't even try and get an
       academic job, instead going directly into finance jobs, computer
       jobs, or maybe doing something like working for the NSA.
       <p>Of those who get a first academic job, many leave academia after a
       couple of years or so.
       <p>For both categories of people, the situation is similar. Getting a
       postdoc at a good place is hard, and getting a tenure-track job at
       a good institution that will support your research is harder. So
       people find that the jobs they can get are either in places they
       really don't want to live, or at primarily teaching institutions.
       Many people find they really don't enjoy not being paid very well
       to do a lot of very low-level teaching. A well-paid job in New
       York doing financial math looks a lot more attractive in many
       ways.
       <p>Once people get to the point of having a tenure-track job in math
       and do it long enough to know they want to stick with it, most end
       up getting tenure, either at the place they start or somewhere
       else.
       <p>The job situation is particle theory is much worse than in math,
       but I haven't been following the careers of more than a few young
       grad students and postdocs in it, so don't have much data about
       what is happening to them right now.
   <h>16. JC Says:
       <h>June 3rd, 2004 at 12:18 am
       <p>Peter,
       <p>How common is it for math or physics folks to take up independent
       research outside of the formal academic system, such as Grigori
       Perelman working on a proof of the Thurston geometrization
       conjecture in relative isolation for many years in St. Petersburg?
       <p>Arguably there's no pressure to publish any "resume padding" type
       of papers, or for that matter publishing anything, when one isn't
       a part of the formal academia system.
       <p>At times I wonder how many folks would be working independently
       (ie. outside of the formal academic system) on things like SUSY
       and/or string theory, if there were no tenured faculty nor any
       untenured faculty or postdocs working on it. I always wondered if
       John Schwarz would have worked on string theory during 1970's and
       early 1980's if Murray Gell-Mann had never kept him around as a
       "permanent postdoc" when string was in hibernation, and possibly
       would have had to take a day job in the private sector outside of
       academia.
   <h>17. Peter Says:
       <h>June 3rd, 2004 at 9:43 am
       <p>It's pretty unusual for people to be able to do much research
       outside of the standard academic system these days. Perelman is an
       interesting special case, I actually don't know to what extent he
       really was cut off from the math community in Russia while he was
       doing his research, or whether he did have colleagues to talk to.
       One funny thing about him is that he's in line for a million
       dollars from the Clay foundation, but seems to have no interest in
       the money. Definitely an unusual character, very devoted to a pure
       approach to abstract research.
       <p>One problem with being outside academia is getting the necessary
       blocks of time to devote to thinking about research. It also is
       much harder to make progress on one's work if one doesn't have
       people to talk to about it, or continuing stimulation of new ideas
       to think about. I've always thought the Institute in Princeton
       wasn't such a great idea, because by isolating people from having
       to teach classes and deal with students, it can keep them from
       having to think about anything other than the one approach to
       their research they are pursuing. It can be quite helpful to be
       forced to think about different topics, and may give one ideas
       about new ways to think about one's research.
   <h>18. JC Says:
       <h>June 3rd, 2004 at 10:12 am
       <p>Peter,
       <p>Do you think the IAS was a cause or symptom for folks like
       Einstein, Goedel, Oppenheimer, etc ... in producing nothing of
       significance for the rest of their lives, and/or producing garbage
       research bordering on crackpottery?
       <p>I remember reading something in a short biography of Kurt Goedel,
       where his wife thought that the IAS wasn't much more than the
       equivalent of a "retirement home" for famous academics who are
       long past their prime.

       <p>I agree with your comments, Peter, on independent research, but
       surely there are examples of successful independent research which
       has taken place outside of academia, although some degree of
       intellectual stimulation may have been present? An obvious example
       would be Einstein, working as a patent clerk in Berne and having
       meetings with others as part of the `Olympia Academy'. Einstein
       must have had, or found, the time to dedicate to his three 1905
       papers. Newton's `miracle year' (1665/6?) was one were he was, as
       far as I've read, isolated on his mother's farm, Cambridge having
       closed due to the plague. Also, people like Hawking and John Nash
       appear to have drifted through their PhDs, waiting until the last
       year or months before finally focussing on a problem (and then
       solving it). Hey, and didn't Louis de Broglie, wealthy aristocrat
       that he was, do physics research for fun?
       <p>Having been a postdoc, I often wonder whether the time and freedom
       (and possibly lack of pressure) necessary for `great', or major,
       works, is more likely to be found outside of academia, and perhaps
       the really big problems of the past, present and future do require
       a proportionately large amount of time and thought to solve. No
       publish or perish rule, no scrabbling or begging for funding -
       perhaps a menial job in the background to earn enough to live on
       whilst one concentrates on the `real' work. I admit that this
       reads as an exceptionally difficult route to acheivement, but
       perhaps in such conditions the `survival instinct' takes over and
       intellectual challenges become all-consuming instead of being part
       of the potentially droll `day job'.
       <p>This seems to be the approach that many - if not all - major,
       award-winning and famous novelists, dramatists and poets take, as
       they are even less likely to be paid to produce work in these
       areas than scientists. The sheer difficulty of their circumstances
       perhaps drives them to brilliance and creative heights, but I
       suppose this requires immense resilience and dedication, perhaps
       to the detriment of family, friends, health, etc. In fact, the
       parallel goes further, as I read that Einstein essentially slept
       for two weeks, exhausted and ill, after arriving at his final
       formulation of special relativity. Didn't Newton's hair gradually
       turn white after his `miracle year', as well? Maybe the cliche `no
       pain, no gain' really does hold.
       <p>I personally don't believe there is sufficient freedom for
       risk-taking and novel research in academia as funding bodies and
       research leaders are very cautious, which is probably to be
       expected (their jobs being on the line as well, if things go
       badly...). Then again, string theory research seems to have
       garnered a very large part of global particle theory research
       funding over the past ten years or more. I myself believe string
       theorists gain funding because of links to particle theory rather
       than any claims about string theory being the "best candidate" for
       a quantum theory of gravitation. Quantum gravity is a problem that
       I believe is not going to be readily solved inside academia,
       unless funding for loop QG and other `alternatives' to string
       theory QG receive more funding so that they can be explored more
       fully. The really big and difficult problems just don't receive
       the funding necessary to resolve them, inside academia: the risk
       is just too great, and in consequence I wouldn't be surprised that
       a lot of research becomes "resume padding". Surely we need more of
       Feynman's "leaps into the wild blue yonder" (I do hope that
       quotation is correct).

       <p>Hello erinj,
       <p>You raise some interesting points.
       <p>The stories about Einstein and Newton do not surprise me. Anyone
       who has done real research (as opposed to just CV padding) will be
       well aware of just how chaotic and haphazard the process is. The
       organising of the chaos that the academic research establishment
       tries to do is somewhat reminiscent of Hollywood, where production
       companies try to turn the successful one-off, off-the-wall idea
       into a steady revenue stream, forgetting that the very reason why
       the idea succeeded was because it was different and crazy.
       <p>It seems to me that the amount of "craziness" (for want of a
       better word) that is tolerated depends on your status. For Nobel
       laureates and Fields medallists, any amount of craziness is
       tolerated - not only that, but many will follow one into the
       abyss. For tenured academics, ditto, but probably few will follow.
       For graduate students or post-docs, on the other hand, deviation
       from the party line is not tolerated at all. Given that in the
       last century almost every significant idea in theoretical physics
       was from someone in their 20's, it would seem to me that something
       is very wrong here.

       <p>Chris,
       <p>Seems like some Nobel laureates went beyond the deep end and never
       climbed out of the abyss, such as Brian Josephson working on
       psychic/voodoo type of phenomenon, or Julian Schwinger working on
       cold fusion in the last years of his life. The only Fields
       medalist I can think of offhand who turned into an oddball, was
       Grothendieck disappearing in 1991 without a trace.
       <p>Anybody know of other oddball cases of Nobel laureates or Fields
       medalists?
   <h>22. Peter Says:
       <h>June 3rd, 2004 at 2:13 pm
       <p>Hi JC,
       <p>There certainly are examples of people who never did very much
       after getting permanent positions at the institute. Hard to tell
       if it would have been different if they were somewhere else. I
       always found the atmosphere there a bit weird, the isolation may
       not be a good thing for many people.
       <p>It will be interesting to see what happens with Seiberg and
       Maldacena. I think Witten spends a lot of his time traveling and
       interacting with people who come to Princeton, so he hasn't become
       as isolated as some others there in the past. The one thing that
       he may be missing is the experience of regularly teaching
       graduate-level courses, something that forces one to regularly
       rethink one's understanding of the basics of one's subject.
   <h>23. Peter Says:
       <h>June 3rd, 2004 at 2:25 pm
       <p>Hi Erin,
       <p>While I think it's really hard to do great research outside of
       academia, you're right that at this point it's also very hard in
       some subjects like particle theory to do it inside academia also.
       <p>Two of the greatest achievements in math during the last decade
       both took about 7-8 years of sustained, very independent work. One
       was Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, he did this from a
       permanent academic position. The other was Perelman's proof of the
       Poincare conjecture, which he seems to have done from outside
       academia. So both are possible, but both required somebody at the
       height of their powers who was able to devote most of their
       intellectual energy for 7-8 years to the project. This certainly
       is not the kind of thing a postdoc is in any position to do, since
       they need to get a new job every 2-3 years, and no one is going to
       give them one based on being in the middle of a difficult
       ambitious project that may not work out.

       <p>Peter,
       <p>Do you think the IAS resembles the research institutes that were
       common in Soviet Russia, such as the various Steklov Institutes?
       Several old Russian friends and colleagues mentioned that in some
       of those research institutes, there was virtually no teaching
       duties nor was anyone required to publish anything. Almost
       everybody was paid something like $200 per month salary,
       regardless whether they did anything or just sat around doing
       nothing for the whole time. After the communist Soviet system fell
       apart, some of the better researchers as well as many younger
       folks left Russia and took up faculty or postdoc jobs at American
       universities.
       <p>Or would these Russian research institute jobs more closely
       resemble tenured jobs at places like Los Alamos, Argonne,
       Brookhaven, etc ...?

       <p>Job advertisements for mathematicians and physicists are

   <h>27. Peter Says:
       <h>June 4th, 2004 at 2:40 pm
       <p>Hi JC,
       <p>I don't know much about Steklov, but I think the IAS is pretty
       different. It has only a small number of permanent people, and
       those jobs are among the hardest to get in the world, so they are
       held by absolutely the most highly respected physicists around.
       It's true they have no formal duties, and some end up doing
       nothing, but in general the level of the people and their activity
       there is very high.
       <p>The theory groups at the national labs might be a bit more
       similar, but again these have only small numbers of permanent
       people, and I assume there is some sort of evaluation process they
       are subject to. I don't think the US has ever had anything
       analogous, i.e. a large institute with a lot of people hired on
       the old communist system of "we don't really pay them, and they
       don't really work".

       <p>As for research outside academia, I find that it is very hard to
       do calculations when one is alone. But forming a research team of
       "exiles" sharing a common seems not easy; I do not know any.
       <p>One could mention solitary snippers, as for instance Barbour, but
       the research then is very exotic by itself (not to mention, ahem,
       mine).
   <h>30. Chris Oakley Says:
       <h>June 4th, 2004 at 6:55 pm
       <p>Hi Alejandro,
       <p>No hires have as yet resulted from that permanent job ad on my CV
       on my web site, partly because the CVs I have been sent as a
       result have never quite fitted the vacancies at the time. The most
       prominent physicist at Nomura - although he is really more a
       mathematician - was William Shaw, who now runs the Mathematical
       Finance course at Oxford. We still see him from time to time. He
       has written a book on solving mathematical finance problems with
       Mathematica, and has a book on Complex Analysis in preparation. He
       started out doing Twistors, and still works on this from time to
       time. He gave a talk recently to the String theorists at
       Cambridge, showing how one could do Strings in four dimensions
       without anomalies using Twistors. This talk, he says, "went down
       like a lead balloon". I guess that they don't want to be deprived
       of the exciting challenge of explaining what happened to the six
       they have spare in their formulation.
       <p>By the way, as for your 2002 "Short Lecture on Divergences" - wash
       your mouth out! You should be apologising for pathological
       divergences, not justifying them. What kind of example is this
       setting to the younger generation?
   <h>31. JC Says:
       <h>June 5th, 2004 at 12:38 am
       <p>Chris,
       <p>I took a look at William Shaw's www page at Oxford and noticed he
       had a pdf file of his recent presentation in finding an anomaly
       free way of doing string theory in 4 dimensions via twistors.
       <p>Over the years I've always wondered if there's any compelling
       loopholes in "quantizing" string theory which bypasses the
       anomalies that locks the number of spacetime dimensions at 10
       (superstring) or 26 (bosonic string). Some paper a few months ago
       by Thiemann hep-th/0401172 attempted to "quantize" the bosonic
       string by loop quantum gravity methods which appears on the
       surface to bypass the usual string anomaly. From what I could
       figure out of Thiemann's paper and in the various discussions
       about it on the string coffee table (at Distler's site) and
       physicsforums.com (in the string section), it appears on the
       surface to be a "quantization" which seems to lack a path integral
       formulation and looks almost "vacuous". So far I haven't seen
       anybody attempting to do a tree level amplitude type of
       calculation to see what the classical limit produces. (ie. Do we
       get back anything that looks like a Veneziano type of formula?)
       <p>It seems like the anomalies in the conventional quantizations (ie.
       canonical and path integral) of string theory are very well
       entrenched in standard treatments of string theory, with so much
       effort expended over the last 20 years on dealing with the "extra
       dimensions" compactified on Calabi-Yau manifolds. If there is
       indeed an "alternative quantization" method which bypasses the
       anomalies in string theory which lock the number of spacetime
       dimensions to 10 or 26, it may possibly put into question all that
       volume of work done on Calabi-Yau compactifications. From a
       self-serving perspective, I would probably find it difficult to
       give up on all that compactification stuff in string theory if I
       was still doing particle/string research today. Less "resume
       padding" type of papers to work on in string theory, if all that
       Calabi-Yau stuff turns out to be irrelevent in the end.
       <p>Sometimes I wonder if the path integral is really the most general
       way of thinking about quantization. At this point I would be
       somewhat reluctant to throw it away into history's trash bin,
       considering how effective it's been in understanding Yang-Mills
       theory and the Standard Model. Arguably many folks would be hard
       pressed to think of something else that could possibly replace the
       path integral.

       <h>June 5th, 2004 at 5:30 am
       <p>Hi JC,
       <p>My detailed knowledge of string theory comes from Peter Woit - the
       most unbiased source - so I am unable to shed light on issues you
       raise. I would suggest an e-mail to William - he's busy, but I am
       sure that he would be happy to discuss these matters.
       <p>I'm similarly useless on path integrals. I never liked them and
       they never liked me. I have always suspected sleight of hand here,
       but have never been able to prove it. A bit like having a
       dishonest cleaning lady. It just seemed to me that the good old
       operator-commutator methods were stronger tools, and that if
       something went wrong that it would be more difficult to weasel
       out. This way one gets a clearer picture of what is going on.
   <h>33. JC Says:
       <h>June 5th, 2004 at 2:27 pm
       <p>Alejandro,
       <p>After when I left academia, initially I thought of doing some
       independent research on my own. It turned out after a year or so I
       found myself pursuing numerous "dead ends" and drifting around
       aimlessly, bouncing around from idea to idea and making very
       little progress. Despite keeping in contact with old colleagues
       via email, I still found it was difficult to settle down and work
       on calculations. Whether it's my own lack of self discipline or
       laziness, I know now from experience that pursuing independent
       research outside of academia to be a long hard "road less
       travelled".
       <p>Despite having long periods of time devoted to thinking and
       contemplating about math and physics, in between job searches and
       sleeping, I still found it relatively hard to bring many of my
       research ideas to fruition while working alone in a solitary
       manner. At times I wonder how folks like Julian Barbour, Grigori
       Perelman, or Andrew Wiles worked during their "self imposed
       exiles" away from mainstream research communities.
   <h>34. Alejandro Rivero Says:
       <h>June 5th, 2004 at 3:11 pm
       <p>Hi Chris, :D DD
       <p>I am still happily surprised that some minor, unpolished, works
       (the "Lecture on Divergences" between them) get random attention
       even if unpublished. In this case, I took care to blame Gabay, the
       librarian, by indirectly drawing my attention towards such
       pathologial matters. I know I am setting a bad example for future
       archeologists (I doubt it will be a younger generation of
       physicists), but at least now I understand why our elders were not
       afraid of divergences (btw, baez did some nice postings recently
       on borel transforms etc). As for the problem of renormalization
       itself, I am optimistic that it can be tamed, and it will show to
       be a problem in the concept of derivative. Long long time ago I
       heard a Field medallist to say that, of course, trivialy, blah
       blah, the derivative is just the simplest example of controlled
       substraction of infinities.
       <p>Let me to do a bit of propaganda for Nomura: hi guys, write
       Oakley! Imagine, you will be able to pay a flat in Newton street
       (pretty smail address), to buy your ve/getables at Holborn market,
       and even to walk straigthly to the work, no need of tube, no need
       of car!
       <p>Around the end of 1999 I visited some of these financial
       industries in London City -I can not say if Nomura itself, but
       Chris could look in the CV database- and I found them to be very
       nice places to work. There exist some meetings on econophysics, so
       you can still train your research sword if you want and meet
       interesting people around.
       <p>On other hand, the financial research is interesting because it is
       a purely artificial system, so it helps you to understand what
       facts come from physics and which ones come from mathematics.
   <h>35. Alejandro Rivero Says:
       <h>June 13th, 2004 at 11:46 am
       <p>An addendum about Nomura.
      <p>I had forgotten it, but time ago I had quoted W.T. Shaw in the
       first page of my essay physics/0001033.
       <p>"if we are getting discrete data from the market, how can we claim
       that the derivative is not zero? Should we say that our derivative
       is almost non zero? What control do we have over the inversion
       process?"
