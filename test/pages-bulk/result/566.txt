<h>Excerpt: Attacks on the Press in 2002

<p>An accomplished New York Times foreign correspondent, now on the paper's
editorial board, writes about the importance of press freedom in the preface
to Attacks on the Press in 2002.

   <h>By Serge Schmemann - April 11, 2003

   <p>From Michael Kelly to David Bloom, from a missing
   pair of Newsday journalists to a Jordan Times reporter in the wrong
   place at the wrong time, recent weeks have reminded us of the risks
   all too frequently faced by reporters. But what we usually forget is
   that journalistsespecially, but not by any means exclusively, war
   journalistsalways face dangers, even when our attention has shifted
   and there's no 24-hour war coverage. The Committee to Protect
   Journalists exists to make sure we never forget about those brave
   reporters. Last year, for example, was a good year, with only 19
   journalists killed as a result of their workthe least deadly year
   since CPJ started tracking this, in 1985. But at the same time, the
   number of journalists in prison rose sharply for the second
   consecutive year, with 136 imprisoned at the end of 2002. CPJ's annual
   survey of these attacks on press freedom was published last week.
   Attacks on the Press in 2002 catalogues 500 cases of media repression
   last year, in more than 120. This is the preface to the book, which
   can be read online at CPJ's site, and you can buy a hard copy of the
   report from the Brookings Institution.

   <p>Many reporters find themselves in a dilemma when the press comes under
   attack. Our pride, our institutional and tribal loyalties, all clamor
   for a retort. We may be the bearers of bad tidings, but we are not
   their cause. If the truth is inimical to you, we want to argue,
   assailing us will not alter it. But then the reporter's half of the
   brain pipes up. Our instinct is (or should be) to stay out of the
   fray, to remain impartial, not to become part of the story. If we
   claim the right to question those in authority, why should our power,
   our institutions, our work be above challenge and criticism? Why
   should we demand special treatment? And who better knows the failings
   of the press than we do? Above all, if we have become the news, have
   we not failed in our primary task of covering the news? These
   conflicting instincts often make us reluctant to write about the
   travails of our trade.

   <p>I think we would all agree that if we deliberately impose ourselves on
   a story, we have failed. But in many years of covering places such as
   the former Soviet Union and the Middle East, I have found that those
   reporters who are harassed, jailed, or killed are rarely those who
   chase after glory, danger, or ratings. Many of them are people who did
   not choose risky assignments but whose countries or beats were caught
   up in conflict, tyranny, or lawlessness. Telling the real story became
   dangerous, but they told it anyway because they believed they had to
   do so. The Wall Street Journal's Daniel Pearl was not kidnapped and
   murdered because he was foolhardy or careless; he was in Pakistan
   because that was where the most important story in his beat was
   developing, and he was killed by extremists who hated him for being a
   journalist, for being an American, and for being a Jew.

   <p>"I don't consider myself a hero," said Respublika editor-in-chief
   Irina Petrushova, a soft-spoken mother who has been threatened,
   harassed, and attacked for writing about government corruption in
   Kazakhstan, after receiving a CPJ 2002 International Press Freedom
   Award. "Like hundreds of my colleagues in other countries around the
   world, I fear for myself and my sons. I am even more afraid that my
   children will have to live in a totally corrupt society. I fear they
   will have to lie, to offer bribes, to grovel in order to be successful
   in their lives. I fear the arbitrary rule of bureaucrats and police,
   who are not accountable to the people, and who are gradually turning
   Kazakhstan into an authoritarian state."

   <p>I was sitting next to Petrushova's husband as she spoke. "This will
   really make them angry," he whispered. "Will that make it worse for
   her?" I asked. "No! No! This is what they need to hear," he replied.

   <p>That brought me back to earlier years, when Petrushova's spiritual
   predecessors among Soviet dissidents would risk their freedom, and
   even their lives, to smuggle information to Western reporters,
   convinced that giving voice, or glasnost, to the realities of the
   Soviet regime was the ultimate weapon against its tyranny. Many of
   those dissenters were also unwilling heroes, people who had come to
   the painful conclusion that they had no moral choice but to tell the
   truth. In the end, it was former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's
   official embrace of glasnostmore than all the other weapons of the
   Cold Warthat brought the communist system crashing down. And however
   sad the revival of despotism across so much of the former Soviet
   empire may be, it is heartening that people such as Petrushova have
   not lost their voice.

   <p>More recently, I spent several months covering the Israeli-Palestinian
   conflict. In 2002, the West Bank ranked at the top of CPJ's list of
   the "worst places to be a journalist" based on the number of
   documented attacks on the press. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a
   very difficult story to cover because of the ardent passions that
   every report arouses among readers and viewers. Journalists are
   constantly accused of bias or of violating restrictions. Yet after
   watching so many reporters and cameramen surmount dangers, hatreds,
   and barriers day after day, I am convinced that the vast majority of
   them do so because that is the only way this story can be told, and
   because they believe it must be told. Their reports may infuriate one
   side or the other, but in the end, no one can claim ignorance of what
   is taking place in that sad and shattered land.

   <p>In the end, that is the answer to the dilemma. The response to those
   who killed Daniel Pearl, or to those who harass Irina Petrushova, is
   to ensure that the stories for which they suffered, their stories, get
   toldnot out of vengeance or spite, but because they need to be told,
   because we ourselves need to hear them. That, ultimately, is our only
   real defense, and the real tribute we can pay to our colleagues.
