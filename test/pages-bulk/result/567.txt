   <p>Music Explorer brings the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Sir
   Colin Davis, to you in your home or in your classroom. Music Explorer
   consists of a videotape and a 64 page listening guidebook written by
   Richard McNicol.

   <p>On this site, you'll find:
     <l>* An introduction to the materials.
     <l>* The contents of Music Explorer
     <l>* Ideas for using Music Explorer in a Standards-based curriculum.
     <l>* Ordering information.
     
   <p>The guidebook sets out for each piece:
     <l>* an introductory page that sets the scene, describing the
       circumstances in which the piece was written (where possible, in
       the composer's own words).
     <l>* 1st listenings: Getting your bearings. Pages that help the
       listener get an overall impression of the music by discovering
       landmarks that give an idea of the span of the piece.
     <l>* 2nd listenings: Structure. Explores the way the music is put
       together (the form).
     <l>* 3rd listenings: The icing on the cake. Guides to some of the
       things that make the music most admirable to the author--designed
       to provoke involvement and individual response. This section also
       contains "secrets of the performance" (about gestures,
       expressions, and interactions among the people making the music on
       the tape) and "can you discover..." (questions to encourage
       students to explore a little further for themselves).
     <l>* Gathering the threads. Answers some of the questions brought up in
       the introduction: "How was the first performance received?" "What
       then happens to the composer?" "How does this composer fit into
       musical history?"

   <p>Music Explorer contains videotaped performances of:
     <l>* Antonio Vivaldi. The Four Seasons, "Spring," 1st Movement

<p>The Music Explorer package includes a variety of
       printed exercises useful for individual or for class study. In
       addition, author Richard McNicol has designed a variety of
       creative classroom projects. Here are six such projects, chosen
       for their effectiveness in helping students reach the National
       Standards in Music Education of the United States of America (note
       that the Music Explorer materials all are directed toward Standard
       9: Understanding music in relation to history and culture).
       <p>Note that the sound files that appear in some of these lessons are
       in MIDI format. You will be able to play them only if your
       computer is set up to accomodate such files, and the sound quality
       will depend on the quality of your computer sound card and other
       hardware.
