<h>Coconut Oil: You Want a Food Loaded with Real Health Benefits? You Want
Coconut Oil


   <h>By Ray Peat

   <h>This is a slightly modified version of Ray Peat's article which can be
   found at http://www.efn.org/~raypeat/ 

   <p>I have already discussed the many toxic effects of the unsaturated
   oils, and I have frequently mentioned that coconut oil doesn't have
   those toxic effects, though it does contain a small amount of the
   unsaturated oils.

   <p>Many people have asked me to write something on coconut oil. I thought
   I might write a small book on it, but I realize that there are no
   suitable channels for distributing such a book -- if the seed-oil
   industry can eliminate major corporate food products that have used
   coconut oil for a hundred years, they certainly have the power to
   prevent dealers from selling a book that would affect their market
   more seriously. For the present, I will just outline some of the
   virtues of coconut oil.

   <p>The unsaturated oils in some cooked foods become rancid in just a few
   hours, even at refrigerator temperatures, and are responsible for the
   stale taste of leftover foods. (Eating slightly stale food isn't
   particularly harmful, since the same oils, even when eaten absolutely
   fresh, will oxidize at a much higher rate once they are in the body,
   where they are heated and thoroughly mixed with an abundance of
   oxygen.)

   <p>Coconut oil that has been kept at room temperature for a year has been
   tested for rancidity, and showed no evidence of it. 

   <p>Since we would expect the small percentage of unsaturated oils
   naturally contained in coconut oil to become rancid, it seems that the
   other (saturated) oils have an antioxidative effect:

   <p>I suspect that the dilution keeps the unstable unsaturated fat
   molecules spatially separated from each other, so they can't interact
   in the destructive chain reactions that occur in other oils.

   <p>To interrupt chain-reactions of oxidation is one of the functions of
   antioxidants, and it is possible that a sufficient quantity of coconut
   oil in the body has this function. It is well established that dietary
   coconut oil reduces our need for vitamin E, but I think its
   antioxidant role is more general than that, and that it has both
   direct and indirect antioxidant activities.

   <p>Coconut oil is unusually rich in short and medium chain fatty acids.
   Shorter chain length allows fatty acids to be metabolized without use
   of the carnitine transport system. Mildronate protects cells against
   stress partly by opposing the action of carnitine, and comparative
   studies showed that added carnitine had the opposite effect, promoting
   the oxidation of unsaturated fats during stress, and increasing
   oxidative damage to cells.

   <p>I suspect that a degree of saturation of the oxidative apparatus by
   short-chain fatty acids has a similar effect -- that is, that these
   very soluble and mobile short-chain saturated fats have priority for
   oxidation, because they don't require carnitine transport into the
   mitochondrion, and that this will tend to inhibit oxidation of the
   unstable, peroxidizable unsaturated fatty acids.

   <p>When Albert Schweitzer operated his clinic in tropical Africa, he said
   it was many years before he saw any cases of cancer, and he believed
   that the appearance of cancer was caused by the change to the European
   type of diet. In the l920s, German researchers showed that mice on a
   fat-free diet were practically free of cancer.

   <p>Since then, many studies have demonstrated a very close association
   between consumption of unsaturated oils and the incidence of cancer.

   <p>Heart damage is easily produced in animals by feeding them linoleic
   acid; this "essential" fatty acid turned out to be the heart toxin in
   rape-seed oil.

   <p>The addition of saturated fat to the experimental heart-toxic oil-rich
   diet protects against the damage to heart cells.

   <p>Immunosuppression was observed in patients who were being "nourished"
   by intravenous emulsions of "essential fatty acids," and as a result
   coconut oil is used as the basis for intravenous fat feeding, except
   in organ-transplant patients. For those patients, emulsions of
   unsaturated oils are used specifically for their immunosuppressive
   effects.

   <p>General aging, and especially aging of the brain, is increasingly seen
   as being closely associated with lipid peroxidation.

   <p>Several years ago I met an old couple, who were only a few years apart
   in age, but the wife looked many years younger than her doddering old
   husband. She was from the Philippines, and she remarked that she
   always had to cook two meals at the same time, because her husband
   couldn't adapt to her traditional food. Three times every day, she
   still prepared her food in coconut oil. Her apparent youth increased
   my interest in the effects of coconut oil.

   <p>In the l960s, Hartroft and Porta gave an elegant argument for
   decreasing the ratio of unsaturated oil to saturated oil in the diet
   (and thus in the tissues). They showed that the "age pigment" is
   produced in proportion to the ratio of oxidants to antioxidants,
   multiplied by the ratio of unsaturated oils to saturated oils.

   <p>More recently, a variety of studies have demonstrated that ultraviolet
   light induces peroxidation in unsaturated fats, but not saturated
   fats, and that this occurs in the skin as well as in the lab.

   <p>Rabbit experiments, and studies of humans, showed that the amount of
   unsaturated oil in the diet strongly affects the rate at which aged,
   wrinkled skin develops.

   <p>The unsaturated fat in the skin is a major target for the aging and
   carcinogenic effects of ultraviolet light, though not necessarily the
   only one.

   <p>In the l940s, farmers attempted to use cheap coconut oil for fattening
   their animals, but they found that it made them lean, active and
   hungry. For a few years, an antithyroid drug was found to make the
   livestock get fat while eating less food, but then it was found to be
   a strong carcinogen, and it also probably produced hypothyroidism in
   the people who ate the meat.

   <p>By the late l940s, it was found that the same antithyroid effect,
   causing animals to get fat without eating much food, could be achieved
   by using soy beans and corn as feed.

   <p>Later, an animal experiment fed diets that were low or high in total
   fat, and in different groups the fat was provided by pure coconut oil,
   or a pure unsaturated oil, or by various mixtures of the two oils. At
   the end of their lives, the animals' obesity increased directly in
   proportion to the ratio of unsaturated oil to coconut oil in their
   diet, and was not related to the total amount of fat they had
   consumed.

   <p>That is, animals which ate just a little pure unsaturated oil were
   fat, and animals which ate a lot of coconut oil were lean.

   <p>G. W. Crile and his wife found that the metabolic rate of people in
   Yucatan, where coconut is a staple food, averaged 25% higher than that
   of people in the United States.

   <p>In a hot climate, the adaptive tendency is to have a lower metabolic
   rate, so it is clear that some factor is more than offsetting this
   expected effect of high environmental temperatures. The people there
   are lean, and recently it has been observed that the women there have
   none of the symptoms we commonly associate with the menopause.

   <p>By l950, then, it was established that unsaturated fats suppress the
   metabolic rate, apparently creating hypothyroidism.

   <p>Over the next few decades, the exact mechanisms of that metabolic
   damage were studied. Unsaturated fats damage the mitochondria, partly
   by suppressing the reparatory enzyme, and partly by causing
   generalized oxidative damage. The more unsaturated the oils are, the
   more specifically they suppress tissue response to thyroid hormone,
   and transport of the hormone on the thyroid transport protein.

   <p>Plants evolved a variety of toxins designed to protect themselves from
   "predators," such as grazing animals. Seeds contain a variety of
   toxins, that seem to be specific for mammalian enzymes, and the seed
   oils themselves function to block protein digestive enzymes in the
   stomach.

   <p>The thyroid hormone is formed in the gland by the action of a protein
   digestive enzyme, and the unsaturated oils also inhibit that enzyme.
   Similar protein digestive enzymes involved in clot removal and immune
   function appear to be similarly inhibited by these oils.

   <p>Just as metabolism is "activated" by consumption of coconut oil, which
   prevents the inhibiting effect of unsaturated oils, other inhibited
   processes, such as clot removal and immune function, will probably
   tend to be restored by continuing use of coconut oil.

   <p>Brain tissue is very rich in complex forms of fats. 

   <p>The experiment (around 1978) in which pregnant mice were given diets
   containing either coconut oil or unsaturated oil showed that brain
   development was superior in the young mice whose mothers ate coconut
   oil.

   <p>Because coconut oil supports thyroid function, and thyroid governs
   brain development, including myelination, the result might simply
   reflect the difference between normal and hypothyroid individuals.

   <p>However, in 1980, experimenters demonstrated that young rats fed milk
   containing soy oil incorporated the oil directly into their brain
   cells, and had structurally abnormal brain cells as a result.
   <p>Lipid oxidation occurs during seizures, and antioxidants such as
   vitamin E have some anti-seizure activity. Currently, lipid oxidation
   is being found to be involved in the nerve cell degeneration of
   Alzheimer's disease.

   <p>Various fractions of coconut oil are coming into use as "drugs,"
   meaning that they are advertised as treatments for diseases. Butyric
   acid is used to treat cancer, lauric and myristic acids to treat virus
   infections, and mixtures of medium-chain fats are sold for weight
   loss.

   <p>Purification undoubtedly increases certain effects, and results in
   profitable products, but in the absence of more precise knowledge, I
   think the whole natural product, used as a regular food, is the best
   way to protect health. 

   <p>The shorter-chain fatty acids have strong, unpleasant odors; for a
   couple of days after I ate a small amount of a medium-chain
   triglyceride mixture, my skin oil emitted a rank, goaty smell. Some
   people don't seem to have that reaction, and the benefits might
   outweigh the stink, but these things just haven't been in use long
   enough to know whether they are safe.

   <p>Treating any complex natural product as the drug industry does, as a
   raw material to be fractionated in the search for "drug" products, is
   risky, because the relevant knowledge isn't sought in the search for
   an association between a single chemical and a single disease.

   <p>While the toxic unsaturated paint-stock oils, especially safflower,
   soy, corn and linseed (flaxseed) oils, have been sold to the public
   precisely for their drug effects, all of their claimed benefits were
   false.

   <p>When people become interested in coconut oil as a "health food," the
   huge seed-oil industry -- operating through their shills -- are going
   to attack it as an "unproved drug."

   <p>While components of coconut oil have been found to have remarkable
   physiological effects (as antihistamines, antiinfectives/antiseptics,
   promoters of immunity, glucocorticoid antagonist, nontoxic anticancer
   agents, for example).

   <p>The cholesterol-lowering fiasco for a long time centered on the
   ability of unsaturated oils to slightly lower serum cholesterol. For
   years, the mechanism of that action wasn't known, which should have
   suggested caution. Now, it seems that the effect is just one more
   toxic action, in which the liver defensively retains its cholesterol,
   rather than releasing it into the blood.

   <p>Large scale human studies have provided overwhelming evidence that
   whenever drugs, including the unsaturated oils, were used to lower
   serum cholesterol, mortality increased, from a variety of causes
   including accidents, but mainly from cancer.

   <p>Since the l930s, it has been clearly established that suppression of
   the thyroid raises serum cholesterol (while increasing mortality from
   infections, cancer, and heart disease), while restoring the thyroid
   hormone brings cholesterol down to normal.

   <p>In this situation, however, thyroid isn't suppressing the synthesis of
   cholesterol, but rather is promoting its use to form hormones and bile
   salts. When the thyroid is functioning properly, the amount of
   cholesterol in the blood entering the ovary governs the amount of
   progesterone being produced by the ovary, and the same situation
   exists in all steroid-forming tissues, such as the adrenal glands and
   the brain.

   <p>Progesterone and its precursor, pregnenolone, have a generalized
   protective function: antioxidant, anti-seizure, antitoxin, anti-spasm,
   anti-clot, anticancer, pro-memory, pro-myelination, pro-attention,
   etc. Any interference with the formation of cholesterol will interfere
   with all of these exceedingly important protective functions.

   <p>As far as the evidence goes, it suggests that coconut oil, added
   regularly to a balanced diet, lowers cholesterol to normal by
   promoting its conversion into pregnenolone. 

   <p>Coconut-eating cultures in the tropics have consistently lower
   cholesterol than people in the U.S. Everyone that I know who uses
   coconut oil regularly happens to have cholesterol levels of about 160,
   while eating mainly cholesterol rich foods (eggs, milk, cheese, meat,
   shellfish). I encourage people to eat sweet fruits, rather than
   starches, if they want to increase their production of cholesterol,
   since fructose has that effect.

   <p>Many people see coconut oil in its hard, white state, and -- as a
   result of their training watching television or going to medical
   school -- associate it with the cholesterol-rich plaques in blood
   vessels. Those lesions in blood vessels are caused mostly by lipid
   oxidation of unsaturated fats, and relate to stress, because
   adrenaline liberates fats from storage, and the lining of blood
   vessels is exposed to high concentrations of the blood-borne material.

   <p>In the body, incidentally, the oil can't exist as a solid, since it
   liquefies at 76 degrees. (Incidentally, the viscosity of complex
   materials isn't a simple matter of averaging the viscosity of its
   component materials; cholesterol and saturated fats sometimes lower
   the viscosity of cell components.)

   <p>Most of the images and metaphors relating to coconut oil and
   cholesterol that circulate in our culture are false and misleading. I
   offer a counter-image, which is metaphorical, but it is true in that
   it relates to lipid oxidation, which is profoundly important in our
   bodies. After a bottle of safflower oil has been opened a few times, a
   few drops that get smeared onto the outside of the bottle begin to get
   very sticky, and hard to wash off.

   <p>This property is why it is a valued base for paints and varnishes, but
   this varnish is chemically closely related to the age pigment that
   forms "liver spots" on the skin, and similar lesions in the brain,
   heart, blood vessels, lenses of the eyes, etc. The image of "hard,
   white saturated coconut oil" isn't relevant to the oil's biological
   action, but the image of "sticky varnish-like easily oxidized
   unsaturated seed oils" is highly relevant to their toxicity.

   <p>The ability of some of the medium chain saturated fatty acids in
   coconut oil to inhibit the liver's formation of fat very likely
   synergizes with the pro-thyroid effect, in allowing energy to be used,
   rather than stored.

   <p>When fat isn't formed from carbohydrate, the sugar is available for
   use, or for
   storage as glycogen. Therefore, shifting from unsaturated fats in
   foods to coconut oil involves several anti-stress processes, reducing
   our need for the adrenal hormones. Decreased blood sugar is a basic
   signal for the release of adrenal hormones.

   <p>Unsaturated oil tends to lower the blood sugar in at least three basic
   ways.

   <p>It damages mitochondria, causing respiration to be uncoupled from
   energy production, meaning that fuel is burned without useful effect.
   It suppresses the activity of the respiratory enzyme (directly, and
   through its anti-thyroid actions), decreasing the respiratory
   production of energy.

   <p>And it tends to direct carbohydrate into fat production, making both
   stress and obesity more probable. For those of us who use coconut oil
   consistently, one of the most noticeable changes is the ability to go
   for several hours without eating, and to feel hungry without having
   symptoms of hypoglycemia.

   <p>One of the stylish ways to promote the use of unsaturated oils is to
   refer to their presence in "cell membranes," and to claim that they
   are essential for maintaining "membrane fluidity." As I have mentioned
   above, it is the ability of the unsaturated fats, and their breakdown
   products, to interfere with enzymes and transport proteins, which
   accounts for many of their toxic effects, so they definitely don't
   just harmlessly form "membranes."

   <p>They probably bind to all proteins, and disrupt some of them, but for
   some reason their affinity for proteolytic and respiration-related
   enzymes is particularly obvious. (I think the chemistry of this
   association is going to give us some important insights into the
   nature of organisms).

   <p>Unsaturated fats are slightly more water-soluble than fully saturated
   fats, and so they do have a greater tendency to concentrate at
   interfaces between water and fats or proteins, but there are
   relatively few places where these interfaces can be usefully and
   harmlessly occupied by unsaturated fats, and at a certain point, an
   excess becomes harmful.

   <p>We don't want "membranes" forming where there shouldn't be membranes.
   The fluidity or viscosity of cell surfaces is an extremely complex
   subject, and the degree of viscosity has to be appropriate for the
   function of the cell. Interestingly, in some cells, such as the cells
   that line the air sacs of the lungs, cholesterol and one of the
   saturated fatty acids found in coconut oil can increase the fluidity
   of the cell surface.

   <p>In red blood cells, which have sometimes been wrongly described as
   "hemoglobin enclosed in a cell membrane," it has been known for a long
   time that lipid oxidation of unsaturated fats weakens the cellular
   structure, causing the cells to be destroyed prematurely.

   <p>Lipid oxidation products lower the rigidity of regions of cells
   considered to be membranes. But the red blood cell is actually more
   like a sponge in structure, consisting of a "skeleton" of proteins,
   which (if not damaged by oxidation) can hold its shape, even when the
   hemoglobin has been removed. Oxidants damage the protein structure,
   and it is this structural damage which in turn increases the
   "fluidity" of the associated fats.

   <p>So, it is probably true that in many cases the liquid unsaturated oils
   do increase "membrane fluidity," but it is now clear that in at least
   some of those cases the "fluidity" corresponds to the chaos of a
   damaged cell protein structure. (N. V. Gorbunov, "Effect of structural
   modification of membrane proteins on lipid-protein interactions in the
   human erythrocyte membrane," Bull. Exp. Biol. & Med. 116(11), 1364-67.
   1993.

   <p>Although I had stopped using the unsaturated seed oils years ago, and
   supposed that I wasn't heavily saturated with toxic unsaturated fat,
   when I first used coconut oil I saw an immediate response, that
   convinced me my metabolism was chronically inhibited by something that
   was easily alleviated by "dilution" or molecular competition.

   <p>I had put a tablespoonful of coconut oil on some rice I had for
   supper, and half an hour later while I was reading, I noticed I was
   breathing more deeply than normal. I saw that my skin was pink, and I
   found that my pulse was faster than normal -- about 98, I think. After
   an hour or two, my pulse and breathing returned to normal.

   <p>Every day for a couple of weeks I noticed the same response while I
   was digesting a small amount of coconut oil, but gradually it didn't
   happen any more, and I increased my daily consumption of the oil to
   about an ounce. I kept eating the same foods as before, except that I
   added about 200 or 250 calories per day as coconut oil.

   <p>Apparently the metabolic surges that happened at first were an
   indication that my body was compensating for an anti-thyroid substance
   by producing more thyroid hormone; when the coconut oil relieved the
   inhibition, I experienced a moment of slight hyperthyroidism, but
   after a time the inhibitor became less effective, and my body adjusted
   by producing slightly less thyroid hormone.

   <p>But over the next few months, I saw that my weight was slowly and
   consistently decreasing. It had been steady at 185 pounds for 25
   years, but over a period of six months it dropped to about 175 pounds.
   I found that eating more coconut oil lowered my weight another few
   pounds, and eating less caused it to increase.

   <h>Dr. Mercola's Comment:

   <p>I have great respect for Dr. Peat's work. He is the main scientist
   that influenced Dr. John Lee with his work on progesterone. Dr. Peat
   does a terrific job of describing some of the many reasons why you
   should strongly consider replacing other oils you use with coconut
   oil. He is a biochemist, however, so his writing can be a bit
   difficult to understand at times.

   <p>Raw coconut is outstanding, and I also use shredded coconut in my
   vegetable juice pulp. These are other great ways to obtain the health
   benefits of coconut.

   <p>You should definitely consider switching to coconut oil exclusively
   for all your sautéing and cooking needs. It does not form dangerous
   trans fatty acids that even olive oil does, and it is far healthier
   than the other vegetable oils out there.

   <p>Finally, if you are using canola oil and are not yet aware of the
   problems with this oil, please click on the link below.
