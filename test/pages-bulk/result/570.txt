                           <h>Winter Infidels' Bash!

   <p>We're trying out a new location this year. New club-member Randy Word
   has a big ranch down near Granbury, and he's graciously allowed us to
   hold our shindig there. There's plenty of back-to-nature stuff to do
   there (hiking, fishing, etc) and lots of great activities for kids.
   Randy has also offered to smoke a batch of ribs for us, so we'll have
   plenty to eat and do.

   <p>We'll likely be having a gift-exchange, so bring along a wrapped gift
   worth under $10 if you'd like to participate.

   <p>It also looks like we're going to have a bigger-than-average group of
   young kids there, so if you bring along a wrapped toy (please keep it
   in the under-$5 range), we'll try to do a gift exchange for the
   kiddos. If your kid is older than about 8, the grownup exchange would
   probably be better.

   <h>What: 
   <p>Metroplex Atheists Infidels Bash

   <h>When: 
   <p>Sunday, December 17, noon until whenever (Randy has a fire-pit
   and cabins if we spend too much time partying)

   <h>Who: 
   <p>YOU! Okay, anyone who's ever been faced annoyance or condemnation
   for not following majority-owned holidays. We'll celebrate any winter
   holiday you'd like.

   <h>What To Bring: 
   <p>Randy will be smoking ribs and sausages, but we'll need
   any further fixins. If you'd like to bring some chips or soda or
   dessert or such, email director@metroplexatheists.org and I'll help
   coordinate snacks so we don't end up with twenty bowls of dip and no
   chips.

   <h>BYOB 

   <h>Where:

   <p>Take 377 SW from I20 in SW Fort Worth towards Granbury (Benbrook
   exit).

   <p>Stay on 377 thru Cresson and on to Granbury, take 377 Business to
   downtown Granbury (the square with large rock courthouse).

   <p>Go to the end of the square (1 block) and turn right on Hwy 4.

   <p>Go thru town and then Hwy 4 angles/turns to the left immediately upon
   crossing the RR tracks.

   <p>Continue on Hwy 4 to Thorp Spring. Stay on Hwy 4 to far end of town
   and look for FM 2580. Stay straight on Hwy 4 but immediately check
   your odometer. Go exactly 4.5mi from 2580 intersection to the turn
   into the ranch. There will be a street sign there that says "Ruff
   Country". You can only turn right so turn right onto Ruff Country
   (gravel road)

   <p>Again check you odometer and go exactly 0.9mi There will be an open
   steel gate on your right. There is a green street sign attached to the
   gate that says "Randy Rd". Turn right and you are now in the ranch.

   <p>Continue another 3/4mi on gravel/dirt road that will twist and turn
   and go down a steep hill and eventually across a creek. Don't give up,
   if you take a wrong turn inside the ranch just keep driving and you
   will find it.

   obscure and are only available publicly in these collections. The
   pictured Robert Ingersoll CD, for example, contains the entire
   12-volume Dresden Edition collection of his speeches and writings.
   This collection would cost over $1000 if purchased on paper, but you
   can get it on CD-ROM for around $25.

       We also ship covers out if you live outside of D/FW. You can order
       them here.

<h>Old News, Protest Reports, and Pictures
     <l>* October 18, 2005, Metroplex Atheists called on Trinity Church
       officials to restrict minors from viewing or working at its
       fundraiser, because the content is not suitable for anyone under
       the age of 18, yet many young children were in attendance.
     <l>* June 6, 2005, after protesting the appearance, Metroplex Atheists
       is calling for a public apology from Governor Rick Perry after an
       appearance in Fort Worth where the Governor insulted and
       mischaracterized Americans devoted to the separation of church and
       state.
     <l>* May 2005, Metroplex Atheists was honored with opportunity to speak
       at the Scouting For All press conference.
     <l>* May 2005, Metroplex Atheists members survived a showing of the
       IMAX science film Volcanoes Of The Deep, which was described as
       "blasphemous" for its statements that the universe is over 6,000
       years old.
     <l>* April 19, 2005, Metroplex Atheists officially gave their kudos to
       the Dallas National Day of Prayer committee for finally putting
       together a NDOP event that wasn't a thinly-veiled political rally.
     <l>* May 1, 2003 was once again the day that Evangelical Protestants
       all over the nation browbeat lawmakers into endorsing their
       religion and give them bad press if they refuse. We were there to
       voice our opinion on the matter.
     <l>* August 17, 2002 was the date of the biannual Promise Keepers event
       in Dallas. We were there.
     <l>* On June 12-14, 2002, the National Catholic Bishops' Conference was
       held in Dallas to try to put together a "policy" regarding
       pedophile priests. While we weren't aware that violent crime
       required a policy other than "imprison the perpetrators", we still
       showed up to voice our opinion on the debacle.
     <l>* May 2, 2002 was the yearly National Day Of Browbeating Lawmakers
       Into Endorsing Evangelical Protestantism And Giving Them Bad Press

     <l>* Metroplex Atheists was the host club for the 8th Annual AAI
       convention over Easter weekend 2002.
     <l>* Following all kinds of theocratic nonsense in Palestine TX,
       including a mandatory prayer rally in the public school and the
       Texas governor's statements that schools should allow coerced
       prayer, December 17 2001 was the date for a "get prayer back in
       school" rally at a local church. Needless to say, we were there to
       protest and several locals joined us to let everyone know
       Palestine is not in lock-step on this issue. Check it out here.
     <l>* Yes, December 16, 2001 was the date for the annual Infidels' Bash
       Holiday Party. See the fun and the latest in the Weatherford sign
       drama.
     <l>* For the second year in a row, several Metroplex Atheists decided
       to get the wits scared out of 'em. And what a better place to lose

     <l>* August 19-25 was the second annual Scouting For All protest of the
       Boy Scout headquarters in Dallas. We've got pics.

       waive fees and bend the rules a bit for a group that wanted to

       to say, we were there. The Fort Worth Star-Telegram recently
       posted an article on the controversy.

       here.
     <l>* On October 27,2000, several Metroplex Atheists members visited a
       Christian answer to haunted houses, the Hell House. Cringe with us
       in gut-wrenching terror here.
     <l>* September 10 was the date of the Cowtown RAM in Fort Worth Texas,
       and Metroplex Atheists helped sponsor the event. Learn more about
       the event here.
     <l>* August 21, 2000 was the national Scouting for All protest. Members

       Way that you can use to voice your support for the movement.
     <l>* George W. Bush did a quick appearance in Dallas on August 19,

                              <h>Why do we fight?

     <p>"Because we must. Because we have the call. Because it is nobler to
     fight for rationality without winning than to give up in the face
     of continued defeats. Because whatever true progress humanity makes
     is through the rationality of the occasional individual and because
     any one individual we may win for the cause may do more for
     humanity than a hundred thousand who hug superstition to their
     breasts."

     <h>-- Isaac Asimov, when asked why he fights religion with no hope for
                                                                 victory
