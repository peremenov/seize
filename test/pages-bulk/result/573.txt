<h>Upgrades in a domain containing Windows 2000 domain controllers

   <p>If you are upgrading servers in a domain containing Windows 2000
   domain controllers, there are a few points to keep in mind. The
   following points are the most important:


   <p>The first step in planning the upgrade of a particular server is to
   check the compatibility of the hardware with products in the Windows
   Server 2003 family. For more information, see Hardware compatibility.
 

   <p>Before you upgrade the first domain controller in a domain where one
   or more domain controllers run Windows 2000, or add a domain
   controller running a product in the Windows Server 2003 family, you
   must prepare the domain (and the forest in which it is located) using
   a simple tool on the Setup CD for Windows Server 2003.

   <p>Before preparing the domain (and the forest in which it is located),
   it is recommended that you apply Service Pack 2 or later to all domain
   controllers running Windows 2000.


   <p>If you have Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 installed on a
   server, when you upgrade the operating system, IIS is upgraded to
   IIS 6.0. However, for application compatibility, IIS runs in IIS 5.0
   isolation mode after the upgrade. For more information about IIS
   isolation modes, see the IIS 6.0 Help.
 

   <p>The Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is enabled by
   default when you upgrade. The security settings in this configuration
   can help make your computer more secure by limiting its exposure to
   malicious Web sites. Therefore, with this enhanced level of security,
   you might find that some Web sites do not display correctly in
   Internet Explorer when you are browsing Internet and intranet Web
   sites. Also, you might be prompted to enter your credentials when
   accessing network resources, such as files in Universal Naming
   Convention (UNC) shared folders. You can easily change the enhanced
   security settings. For more information, see Internet Explorer
   Enhanced Security Configuration.
 

   <p>As you complete domain controller upgrades and reduce the number of
   different operating system versions running on them, you can adjust
   the domain and forest functional levels appropriately. For more
   information about functional levels, see Domain and forest
   functionality and Raising domain and forest functional levels. For
   general information about Active Directory, see Active Directory.

   <p>If you have servers running Windows NT, also review the following
   points:
 

   <p>Before running Setup, it is recommended that you review the file
   systems and partitions that exist on the server. You must have at
   least one NTFS partition on domain controllers. It is recommended that
   you use NTFS on all partitions on all the servers in the domain,
   because any FAT or FAT32 partition lacks many security features. For
   example, on FAT or FAT32 partitions, a shared folder can be protected
   only by the permissions set on the shared folder, not on individual
   files, and there is no software protection against local access to the
   partition. For more information, see Reformatting or converting a
   partition to use NTFS and Convert.
 

   <p>If some of your domain controllers run Windows 2000 and some run
   Windows NT, it is recommended that you upgrade the Windows NT domain
   controllers as soon as is practical, to reduce the number of version
   differences between computers, simplify management and
   troubleshooting, and strengthen security.
  

   <p>Before you begin an upgrade from Windows NT 4.0, you must apply
   Service Pack 5 or later.
  

   <p>If you have servers or client computers that run Windows NT 3.51, it
   is recommended that you install or upgrade to a newer operating system
   on all these computers, or retire them from operation. If you have
   more than one domain, you must upgrade domain controllers running
   Windows NT 3.51 for reliable logon validation. In any case, upgrading
   or retiring computers running Windows NT 3.51 strengthens security and
   reduces the number of version differences between computers,
   simplifying management and troubleshooting.

   <p>After the domain and forest are prepared, there are two stages in the
   upgrade of a domain controller. First you run Setup to upgrade the
   operating system and then, when Setup is complete, you run the Active
   Directory Installation Wizard (which appears on the screen the first
   time you log on).
