        <p>After last week's diet related article posted in the Military.com
    Newsletter, I received several emails about helping the reader repair
     their diet. There is a diet plan I refer people to with a motivating
       and humorous picture as well as a free downloadable sample week of
    diet information. However, you should visit a registered dietician if
                             you are severely overweight or pre-diabetic.

      <p>Pre-diabetic refers to Type II diabetes and usually occurs in older
          and/or obese people who do not have to have a family history of
   diabetes. 80 percent of Type II diabetics are overweight. This type of
           diabetes can be prevented or significantly delayed by watching
                       processed sugar intake and regular daily exercise.

      <p>This week's question is related to the above paragraphs. The former
     Army soldier writes, My doctor says my blood sugar is too high and I
       have tried exercise, a no carbohydrate diet, and am having trouble
                               keeping my blood sugar and my weight down.

   <p>As you know, I am not a doctor. But there are still two areas you need
    to focus on. The fact that you stated your sentence in the past tense
   causes me to ask -- are you still exercising? Daily? For 45-60 minutes
       a day? And -- are you still watching your food intake? Because the
     only way you can have high blood sugar is IF you are eating foods or
       soft drinks or juices with sugar in them period. The exercise will
      allow you to burn the blood sugar before it has a chance to turn to
      fat and it will burn your stored fat as well, thus causing a weight
                                                                    loss.

        <p>The two areas to focus on for at least 3-4 months faithfully are:
     <p>* Food intake - To control your high blood sugar you have to watch
       your intake of carbohydrates -- true -- but you do not have to
       eliminate them as required by the Atkin's Diet. High sugar sodas,
       fruit drinks, processed foods are bad, but carbohydrates in
       fruits, vegetables are good fuels sources for your body, so do not
       eliminate them from your diet. Just make sure you are exercising
       daily by simply walking, biking, do a superset of pushups and
       crunches. See the Article Archive for more ideas of daily
       routines.

     <p>* Exercise -- There are two types of exercise: Aerobic and Anaerobic
       . Aerobic means with oxygen and refers to exercise that maintains
       a level of activity capable of moving oxygen through your lungs,
       blood, heart and to your muscles. This is a great fat burning zone
       and requires you to keep your heart rate at 50-70 percent of max
       heart rate, which is theoretically (220 minus age). Keep it
       conversational pace, meaning be able to talk, but it is not that
       easy to talk and breathe regularly.
       <p>Anaerobic means without oxygen and refers to exercise that causes
       the heart to race in the 70-90 percent of maximum heart rate and
       includes sprinting while running, biking, swimming, and even
       weight training or high repetition calisthenics exercises
       (resistance training). Your heart and lungs cannot keep up with
       the demand for oxygen your muscles are placing on them, so you
       will tire out fast but burn a significant amount of blood sugar
       (glycogen).

     <p>So -- back to the Army soldier's question. Start Exercising Everyday
                                                                     NOW!

   <p>Along with weight loss, your goal will be to begin program of physical
          activity, if you are not exercising regularly now. Why? Because
   physical activity will help you use the insulin you produce to convert
     the food you eat into energy. This will help keep your blood glucose
      lower. A great example -- it is always a good idea to follow a meal
                                                       with a brisk walk.

        <p>If you can make sure your exercise combines aerobic and anaerobic
       activity every day, then you will have a better chance of lowering
    your blood sugar. And you need make sure your refined sugar intake is
                                                                 limited.
        <p>The bad news is this. Many people with Type II diabetes find that
     despite their best efforts, weight control, exercise and diet aren't
      enough to keep their blood sugars in a healthy range. One theory is
       that some people's insulin-producing cells just get tired out from
          having to produce more and more insulin because their cells are
       resistant to the effects of insulin. So, try to focus on the above
      recommendations for at least three months. Go to your doctor again,
                            and talk about the possibilities of diabetes.
