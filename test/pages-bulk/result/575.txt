   <h>June 2003 
   <h>MSE trial results show Phonomena training 'PhAB' average
   age-equivalent increases of 2.4 years after just 4 weeks training.
   <p>When re-tested 6 weeks after training, a further 0.6 years increase.
   This shows Phonomena develops the learner's own resources (trains the
   senses) so that improvement continues after the training has been
   completed, not only in the listening skills that have been practised,
   but also in standard tests of hearing and speech.
   <h>June 2003 
   <p>Phonomena first set of field trial results from SLTs announced in

   <h>August 2002 
   <h>Flagship Speech and Language Therapists trials show age equivalent
   improvement of 1.8 years in word listening ability.
   <p>In a smaller trial in Special Schools, an age improvement of 1.2 years
   was found. These improvements are dramatic, and compare more than
   favourably with other commercial trials of language training software
   designed for perceptual learning. They prove the effectiveness of
   Phonomena Training in building listening skills that are essential for
   normal language.
   <h>May 2002 
   <h>Field trials of Phonomena start.
   <p>Trial groups are: Speech Language Therapists, Special Schools,

   MindWeavers approach of using intensive training near the 'edge of
   competence'.
