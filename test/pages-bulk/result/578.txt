   <h>Blood transfusion from baby brother proves successful

   <h>K.C. Howard - Staff Reporter 

   <p>With her brother's bone marrow cells thriving inside her, six-year-old
   Molly Nash returned home to Englewood, Colo. after 118 days at
   Fairview-University Medical Center.

   <p>Molly received a life-saving blood transfusion from her newly born
   brother Adam on Sept. 26, which spared her from a fight against
   Fanconi anemia.

   <p>The rare recessive disease causes bone marrow failure in its victims,
   deteriorating their immune systems.

   <p>This potentially fatal illness caused several birth defects in Molly,
   including two holes in her heart and no thumbs or hip sockets. She was
   also born without a portion of her brain.

   <p>"Molly knows more about life than any child her age should," said
   Sarah Youngerman, the public relations coordinator for the Academic
   Health Center.

   <p>After eight reconstructive surgeries, Molly's birth defects were no
   longer inhibiting. Her weak immune system, however, was threatening
   her survival.

   <p>To beat this potentially fatal disease, University doctors used
   umbilical cord blood from Adam. His healthy blood cells then destroyed
   and took over Molly's malignant bone marrow, allowing her to
   efficiently produce red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.

   <p>This transfusion was the first of its kind because Molly's cure -- her
   brother Adam -- was genetically selected as a healthy embryo and
   perfect blood donor for Molly.

   <p>Genetic selection of children is controversial, but Youngerman said
   that most people are very supportive of the Nashes' decision and are
   happy to hear that Molly is recovering more quickly than expected.

   <p>"Adam's bone marrow has completely taken over and her white cells are
   cured," said University cord blood specialist Dr. John Wagner, who
   performed the procedure.

   <p>He added that although the transfusion increased Molly's chances of
   survival, she will still be more receptive to cancer than most people.

   <p>Molly will return to Minnesota for checkups in April and September.

   <p>To protect herself from infections that could damage her healing
   immune system, Molly must stay indoors and wear a mask until her
   immune system has completely recovered.

   <p>"Molly is a very sophisticated girl," Youngerman said, "though she
   knows she can't be exposed to people, even if she misses out on going
   to restaurants with her family."

   <p>But in the fall, Youngerman said, Molly looks forward to attending
   second grade at a local school.
