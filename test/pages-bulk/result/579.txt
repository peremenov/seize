   <h>BNonimmigrant Visa

     <h>B-1: 
	 <p>For individuals visiting temporary for "business", i.e.,
     engaging in commercialtransactions such as attending conferences,
     business meetings, executingcontracts, undertaking negotiations.
     Can not be "gainfully employed"in the U.S.; payment/salary to B-1
     nonimmigrant should be made abroad. The B-1 or B-2 visa holders are
     normally allowed into the U.S. for a 6-monthperiod.
     <h>Note:
     <p>Must have financial support and intentto depart.  Additionally,
     some port-of-entry offices (Western Region)may disqualify admission
     of a B-1 nonimmigrant (or corresponding Visa WaiverProgram
     nonimmigrant [see below]) if the foreign national is entering
     theUnited States and will be:  a) compensated from a U.S. source
     (beyondreimbursement for expenses or per diem), or b) even if
     uncompensated, performservices for which a U.S. worker would have
     to be hired or are the servicesinherently part of the U.S. labor
     market, or c) services primarily benefitingthe U.S. entity as local
     work or hire as contrasted with benefiting theforeign national
     him/herself or the foreign employer in furtherance ofinternational
     trade).
     <p>`PDF4Download:USCIS Western Regional Memorandum "Admission of
     B-1/WB Visitors"  (05/02)(US CIS/DHS)

     <h>B-2: 
	 <p>For individuals visiting temporary for "pleasure", i.e.,
     engaging in tourism,visiting relatives, attending conventions,
     language students (less than18 hours a week).  The B-1 or B-2 visa
     holders are normally allowedinto the U.S. for a 6-month period.
     Spouses and dependents of a nonimmigrantvisa, such as H-1B, are
     eligible for an H-4.  However, "cohabitatingpartners", who are not
     spouses or dependents, can apply for the B-2 visa.
     <h>Note:
     <p>Must have financial support and intentto depart.

   <h>Cohabitating Partners:
   <p>The Department of State (DOS) has issuedguidance that emphasize that
   "cohabitating partners" may apply for theB-2 nonimmigrant visa.
   "Cohabitating Partner" means individuals whoare not spouses or
   dependents, but who have lived/resided on a long-termbasis, with the
   principle visa holder.  The DOS states that this istrue for "both
   opposite and same-sex partners."  (Note: The individual, however, must
   overcome INA 214(b).)

     <h>Medical Treatment:
     <p>The VSC (US CIS) indicates that whilethere are is maximum duration
     of status for B-2 holders who are receivingmedical treatment , or
     accompanying an individual who is receiving medicaltreatment.
     However, any period over one year will be subject to
     scrutiny,because the US CIS may make a determination that the B-2
     visa holder mayhave immigrant intent (intent to reside permanently
     in the U.S., whichis contrary to the "temporary/nonimmigrant"
     nature of the B-2 visa). With respect to medical treatment related
     B-2 visas, the duration of statuscan be longer than a year if
     sufficient evidence of the need for medicaltreatment and  ability
     to financially fund the treatment are presented. For Medical
     Treatment B-2s, it is important to prove that there is no
     U.S.government financing for medical expenses (however, the patient
     can receivedonations from a local church or other non-profit
     organization that isoffering support).

     <h>VWP (Visa WaiverProgram):
     <p>An individuals does not need a B-1 orB-2 visa if they can use the
     VWP (Visa Waiver Program) for travel to theUnited States for less
     than 3 months.  Those who require the B-2 visabecause VWP is
     unavailable, or because the duration is more than 3 months,normally
     are given a 6-month period of B-1/B-2 stay in the United
     States. Once in the U.S., extensions are possible, but too many may
     be consideredas not "temporary."  However, the Department of State
     has issued guidancestating that:  "the fact that the period of stay
     in a given case mayexceed six months or a year is not in itself
     controlling, provided theconsular officer is satisfied that the
     intended stay actually has a timelimitation and is not indefinite
     in nature."
     <p>(See VisaWaiver Program (VWP).)

     <h>Changes to B-1/B-2Visas (Affecting Intended F & M Students):
     <p>On April 12, 2002,the US CIS published new rules imposing new
     restrictions on B-1/B-2visitors and those who seek to obtain
     student visas (after entering theU.S. using a B-1/B-2 visa).

     <h>InterimRule: Prohibition on Attending School Prior to Change of
     Status from B-1/B-2to F-1 or M-1
     <p>Before the interim rule, visitors admittedunder B-1/B-2 visas were
     allowed to begin attending school before the USCIS approved their
     request to change status to F-1 or M-1 students. The interim rule
     does not eliminate the ability of B-1/B-2 visitors tochange their
     status to F-1 or M-1 students.  However, it prohibitsB-1/B-2
     visitors from attending school without first obtainingUSCIS
     approval.  The US CIS is institutingthis change as a direct result
     of the terrorist attacks of September 11.

     <h>Proposed Rule:New Requirements for Change of Status from B-1/B-2 to
     F-1 or M-1
     <p>In addition to the interim rule, the USCIS issued a proposed rule
     that requires B-1/B-2 visitors to notifythe US CIS of their intent
     to attend schoolin the U.S. when they initially enter the US as
     B-1/B-2 visitors. Furthermore,if they have already received any
     I-20 forms from schools, they must producethe forms to the
     inspecting officers at the time of admission.  Inspectingofficers
     will make the proper notification on I-94 Entry/Departure cardthat
     the B-1/B-2 visitors are prospective students.
     <p>(See F-1Student Visa.)
     <p>(See M-1Student Visa.)

     <h>Proposed Rule:Minimum Admission Period Eliminated
     <p>Currently, visitors admitted under B-1/B-2visas are routinely
     granted a 6-month period of admission, regardless ofthe time they
     actually intend to stay in the United States.  The proposedrule
     will eliminate the automatic 6-month admission period for B-2
     visitors,and only provide a period of time that is necessary as
     explained by thevisitor.  If B-2 visitors cannot explain to the
     satisfaction of theinspecting officers, they will be granted a
     30-day period of admissiononly.  If B-2 visitors can establish the
     need for a period of staylonger than 30 days, an appropriate period
     of admission will be grantedup to 6 months.

     <h>Proposed Rule:Maximum Period of Admission Reduced
     <p>The US CIS isalso proposing to reduce the maximum period of
     admission for B-1/B-2 visitorsfrom 1 year to 6 months.

     <h>Proposed Rule:Changes to Standards for Extension of Stay
     <p>The maximum period for each extensionof stay application will
     remain 6 months for B-1/B-2 visitors.  However,the proposed rule
     will limit the conditions under which B-1/B-2 visitorscan request
     an extension of stay.  B-1/B-2 visitors will be eligiblefor an
     extension of stay only in cases that have resulted from
     unexpectedor compelling humanitarian reasons.  In addition, they
     must provethat they have adequate financial resources to support
     their stay in theU.S. and that they are maintaining a residency
     abroad which they have nointention of abandoning.

   <h>VWP(Visa Waiver Program)

     <p>This isNOT a visa (no change of status, no extension of stay
     allowed), but isissued for those individuals with B-1 or B-2
     intent, and who wishes toenter the U.S. for less than three (3)
     months.  You must be a nationalof a qualifying country (individuals
     who are ineligible for VWP, or thosewho require US stays of more
     than 3 months, may seek the B-1/B-2).
     <h>Note:
     <p>Must have return-ticket out of the U.S. There is no need to apply
     for visa "sticker" issuance from the USCIS, or visa "sticker" from
     the U.S. Consulate/Embassy.


   <h>September25, 20038 MRP(machine-readable passport) Requirement
   Postponed for 21 Countries
   <p>The Dept. of State (with the Dept. ofHomeland Security) has officially
   announced the postponement of the MRPrequirement (see below) for "visa
   waiver (VWP)" travelers for nationalsof 21 countries:  Australia,
   Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany,Iceland, Ireland, Italy,
   Japan, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,Portugal, San Marino,
   Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UnitedKingdom.
   Nationals of other countries wishing tovisit the U.S. must either have
   a MRP for "visa waiver (VWP)" entry (ifqualifying country), or a visa.
   <h>June16, 20038 Entry& Departure:  Machine-Readable Passport Required
   for Visa WaiverProgram (VWP)
   <p>Under the Visa WaiverProgram (VWP), the citizens of certain countries
   may visit the U.S. forbusiness or pleasure for up to 90 days without a
   visa "sticker." Effective October 01, 2003,all travelers who wish to
   travel to the U.S. under the Visa Waiver Program(VWP) must possess a
   machine-readable passport (MRP) issued by their governmentand present
   it at the U.S. port of entry. Those who do not possess sucha passport
   must apply for a nonimmigrant visa (such as an B-1/2) at theU.S.
   Embassy/Consulate (Dept. of State) prior to traveling to the
   UnitedStates.
   <p>Visa Waiver Program(VWP) countries:  Andorra, Australia, Austria,
   Belgium, Brunei, Denmark,Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland,
   Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein,Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, New
   Zealand, Norway, Portugal, SanMarino, Singapore, Slovenia, Spain,
   Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdomand Uruguay. (The list changes
   occasionally; please check the Departmentof State website for updated
   lists.)
   <p>Also:  Ifyou enter the U.S. under this program, you cannot extend your
   stay past90 days except for very limited circumstances, and you cannot
   change toanother nonimmigrant status while in the United States. In
   addition, youcannot adjust status unless an immigrant petition is
   based on an immediaterelative relationship. Therefore, if you are a
   citizen of a qualified countrybut plan to stay past 90 days or to
   change your status in the U.S, youmay want to consider obtaining a
   nonimmigrant visa such as B-1 or B-2.
   <p>Also:  Citizensof Belgium who wish to travel to the U.S. under the
   Visa Waiver Programmust possess a machine-readable passport issued by
   the Government of Belgiumeffective May 15, 2003. Otherwise, they are
   required to apply for a nonimmigrantvisa prior to traveling to the
   United States.

     <h>StrategicDifference:  B-1/B-2 and Visa Waiver Program
     <p>The B-1 or B-2 allows individuals to extendthe stay in the U.S. (by
     filing an extension) or to change status (to anF-1, L-1, etc.).
     VWP holders, because it is not a visa, cannot filean extension nor
     change status.  In the past, individuals seekingto attend school,
     but could not apply for an F-1 student visa, enteredthe U.S. on a B
     visa, first.  Business people who wanted to starta business also
     entered the U.S. on a B visa to begin initial preparations.
