                 <h>DD "Graduates" from speech next week! :) 

   <h>By Dana on Thursday, May 1, 2003 - 12:36 pm:

   <p>DD had her annual evaluation today. She did GREAT!!!!! She is smack
   right on target for her age. She is not above or below, but right on
   target. That is good enough for me! I am so proud of her.
   <p>Her teacher said we could let today be her last day or do next week.
   Truth be known, I am so DONE with biweekly visits. I asked DD if she
   wanted to come next week and work on /SH/ or be finished today. She
   wanted to do one more week.
   <p>We went across the street and bought two videos at the pawn shop to
   celebrate (they only cost $3 ea!)
   <p>I am so proud and happy for her. So glad we got her tonsils out. Life
   is GOOD!

   <p>YEAH!! After all you and A have been through, this is great news!
   <p>My DD has made HUGE strides with her speech since starting therapy at
   3, however I think she has at least another year to go. It has done
   her a world of good for her self confidence as well. She only goes
   once a week and loves her therapist.

   <p>That is awesome news!!! Congrats to A!
   <p>I can't wait for my dd to be done with hers. She has it 2x week in
   school and a double session at the hospital weekly. Its a pain.
   <p>DS used to take speech but he caught up last fall and is to be
   re-evaluated this fall to see if he needs to restart again. I hope he
   doesnt have to because it is a lot of running around.

   <p>Congratulations to your DD!!!!! :) :) :) :) :) :)

   <p>Congrats!! Wonderful news Dana. I can assure that her speech therapist
   is just as excited. It is always a thrill to discharge a child who
   "graduates" because they are doing great (as opposed to those who
   move, quit coming, etc.)Kudos to both of you!!

   <h>By Pamt on Thursday, May 1, 2003 - 10:17 pm:

   <p>P.S. Renee, as a therapist who works at an outpatient clinic at a
   hospital let me just tell you how highly you are esteemed by your DD's
   therapist(s). We all quickly get a feel for "good parents" (those who
   rarely miss appts., who follow through with the home program, are on
   time, etc.) and the not-so-good parents. We also realize what a huge
   sacrifice it is to haul your kid (usually with siblings in tow) to
   therapy twice a week and then sit and wait while entertaining bored
   kids in the waiting room while we work with your child. You are a
   jewel among moms! Hope your DD makes super fast progress!! ((Renee))

   <p>Pam, you made me chuckle. How in the world did you know by my lil
   comment that I always made sure she made it to speech, we're never
   late and practiced with her???
   <p>I thought for sure I came off pretty badly stating how much a pain it
   was. lol
   <p>Actually, I'm not sure how long it will be before we are done. Out
   therapist hasn't yet determined if dd has apraxia yet. A lot leads to
   it but.. But she has made lots of improvement in the past 2 years. :)

   <h>By Dana on Friday, May 2, 2003 - 04:53 pm:

   <p>Renee, what is apraxia?

   <h>By Trina on Friday, May 2, 2003 - 05:13 pm:

   <p>Here you go, Dana. :)
   
   <h>By Pamt on Friday, May 2, 2003 - 05:16 pm:

   <p>Dana, apraxia (a HUGE interest of mine!) is when a child is physically
   capable of making speech sounds in that there is no muscular problem,
   but they have difficulty sequencing the sounds of speech and stringing
   them together. For example, the child can produce /p/ and /t/ and even
   consonant-vowel syllables with these sounds like pea, poo, pah, tuh,
   tay, etc. But when the 2 syllables are combined, like in "potty" for
   example, the child might end up saying "gahfee". It is the same type
   of thing that happens if you try to say "linoleum-linoleum-linoleum"
   repeatedly very fast. Your mouth knows what to do, but the message
   gets short-circuited in between your brain planning the subtle fine
   motor speech movements and your mouth actually doing them. Apraxia
   results in poor articulation, but the errors are inconsistent and in
   no particularly pattern. Speech therapy to treat apraxia is very
   different than a traditional or a phonological approach to
   articulation.
   <p>Renee, I'm very curious as to why they haven't yet determined if she
   has apraxia yet if she's already been in speech 2 years??

   <h>By Renee on Friday, May 2, 2003 - 05:25 pm:

   <p>Thanks for explaining Pam.
   <p>I think one reason why its taking so long is that DD has behavoral
   problems that the therapist has been working on in addition to the
   speech. I would love for them to dx it so that our insurance would
   cover it since its not covered at the moment.
   <p>Plus dd has had problems with muscle movement She just now is getting
   used to using her tongue correctly. Before therapy started, she would
   talk without moving her mouth and it looked and sounded like a person
   whose had a stroke.
   <p>Even though our therapist is wonderful, it does leave me wondering
   now, why it isnt dx fully yet. hmmmmmmm...

   <h>By Dana on Friday, May 2, 2003 - 07:44 pm:

   <p>hmm. Amazing what all goes into speaking :)
