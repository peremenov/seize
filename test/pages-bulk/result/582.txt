<h>Moscow Student Accuses Police of Rape, Gets Shot

   <h>MosNews
   
   <p>On Saturday, April 10, German Galdetsky, a 19-year-old college
   student, was shot point-blank at a train terminal in the middle of
   Moscow. Two days earlier, Novaya Gazeta, a Moscow daily newspaper, had
   published a long interview with Galadetsky. In the interview, he
   described his one-man struggle against the practice recently taken up
   by the cops who police the Moscow subway -- detaining young women,
   preferably without proper Moscow registration, threatening them and
   raping them.
   <p>Currently, Galdetsky is in a Moscow hospital in grave condition, with
   multiple gun wounds to the head, undergoing surgery. The shooting has
   been called an assassination attempt by Galdetsky's father in a letter
   to Novaya Gazeta. Rashid Nurgaliyev, Russia's Minister of Internal
   Affairs (the police comes under the Ministry's jurisdiction) has
   vouched to head the investigation of the assault, but the question
   remains -- was the shooting of Galdetsky the result of his
   investigation of a crime that is flourishing in the Moscow underground
   under the guise of law enforcement? Novaya Gazeta says it was.
   <h>Galadetsky's Story
   <p>In the interview Galdetsky gave to Novaya Gazeta, he explained that
   his quest for justice started in February, when a friend and he saw a
   girl having her ID checked by a subway policeman at a central Moscow
   station. The policeman took the girl's passport and took her to the
   police station -- there is one, complete with a detention room, at
   every Moscow metro station. Galdetsky knocked on the door and asked if
   the girl was being detained. After being told that she wasn't but
   seeing that she wasn't released, he ran upstairs to call Moscow's
   Security (police) office on his cell phone.
   <p>Then Galdetsky ran back down and mentioned his call to the policemen
   who detained the girl. Once they heard that he had called their
   superiors, they let the girl go, trembling and crying as she was. She
   told Galdetsky that she had been sexually harassed and threatened with
   murder. When Galdetsky attempted to take pictures of the cops with the
   camera installed in his cell phone, he was forced to delete every
   picture while the cops tried to convince him that the girl was, in
   fact, a prostitute whose services they regularly employed.
   <p>This was the beginning of Galdetsky's crusade. He wanted to make sure
   the cops who had harassed the girls were punished and set about
   complaining to the proper authorities. Going from one subway line to
   the next, he wound up learning more about the convoluted hierarchy of
   the police assigned to monitor the Moscow metro than he had ever
   wanted to know. As he got booted from door to door, Galdetsky learned
   of the problem's true scope. Coming into one investigator's office to
   file a complaint, he was shown a bookshelf of black files containing
   complaints just like his. He was assured that only 10% -- if that --
   ever made it to court. Galdetsky made phone calls, wrote complaints,
   gathered evidence, rounded up the victims of harassment, put up ads on
   internet message boards, got in touch with Moscow's top police
   official. People started calling him whenever they had problems,
   hoping for help.
   <p>The way the cops operate, he told Novaya Gazeta, was by approaching
   young women who were out late at night, alone, plainly dressed. Such a
   potential victim is more likely to be a) defenseless, b) lacking the
   proper papers. They would detain them for an ID check, draw out the
   check until the last train was gone (the Moscow subway closes at 1 am)
   and then threaten and rape the women. Sometimes those who resisted
   were left alone; on other occasions they were accused of assaulting
   police officers.
   <p>A conversation Galdetsky reports having had with a police
   investigator:
   <p>Galdetsky: On a Sunday, in Moscow, policemen harassing a girl
   <p>Investigator: These things happen every day!
   <p>Galdetsky: What, right in the center of the city?
   <p>Investigator: At any metro station!
   <p>The interview was published on Thursday. On Saturday, Galdetsky was on
   his way to a hospital with a gun wound to the head.
   <h>A Policed State
   <p>As long-time and recent locals will tell you, the most shocking part
   of this story is not that Moscow policemen have been accused of
   perpetrating acts of violence. It isn't the fact that the person who
   did the finger-pointing is fighting for his life. It's that someone --
   a teenage college student, at that -- decided to do something about
   it. Moscow police have a reputation for harassment; Moscow's draconian
   registration rules pretty much grant them the right to detain anyone
   they like.
   <p>Moscow police routinely stop passers-by in the street or on the subway
   and demand to see their ID; their primary interest is a stamp or a
   slip that shows an individual as registered with the police. Deemed a
   reprehensible practice by human rights activists all over the world,
   the city administration's requirement that all visitors register
   within three days of arrival is difficult and nerve-wracking to
   complete. Unable to find someone willing to register them at a
   privately owned apartment at the expense of time and energy wasted in
   lines at housing offices and police departments, many newcomers to
   Russia's capital either buy a fake registration slip or go without.
   When detained, some bribe their way out, some talk their way out, and,
   in what Galdetsky uncovered to be a harassment scheme of horrifying
   proportions, some young women aren't able to get away unscathed.
   <h>Now What?
   <p>Last summer, a number of highly placed police officers were exposed as
   extorters and drug barons, with the gang nicknamed the "police
   werewolves" by then-Interior Minister Boris Gryzlov. Now that the new
   interior minister has taken over Galdetsky's case, Russia might see
   another "werewolf" ring rooted out -- perhaps, only to be replaced
   with more corrupt police officers. Or this case might chip away at the
   foundation of Moscow's police corruption -- the registration rules.
   But nothing will change if no one joins Galdetsky in picking up this
   cause, especially after Saturday.
