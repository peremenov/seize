<h>Mobile Casinos: A Window of Opportunity

   <p>Russia's cellular operators realize that the non-voice services that
   they can offer their subscribers are a real goldmine of future
   profits. Currently the revenues from non-voice services, the most
   popular of which is, of course, SMS (short message service), amount to
   approximately 10% of the total. And while this figure is quite
   admirable, there is still a way to go.
   <p>In order to attract the widest circle of subscribers, the cell network
   operators and their affiliated companies have come up with new
   services. Among the most recent ones are Mobile Bodyguards offered by
   MobileTeleSystems, the SMS service, announced by BeeLine, for lovers
   of Russian history, which can be easily used as a crib by high school
   and university students, and mobile casino for MegaFon's clients. And
   while MegaFon, Russia's third largest and fastest growing cell network
   operator, was the first to offer mobile casino service, it certainly
   won't be the last.
   <p>Considering how thriving the online casino segment of the Russian
   Internet is, it was only a matter of time before somebody came up with
   the idea of offering the same thing to mobile phone users, stuck in
   traffic, out at the country house, on the subway or anywhere else for
   that matter.
   <p>Last week saw the announcement of the first mobile casino, which is
   independent from all operators and therefore open to all mobile phone
   users. The Flash Money project was created from the intersection of a
   Java game technology and the real casino business, which is one of the
   most handsomely profitable branches of Russia's entertainment
   industry.
   <p>The first game, introduced by the Flash Money company, is Flash Slot
   which is basically a slot machine on your mobile phone. The casino's
   creators point out four basic advantages of the project. They are
   mobility, security, availability and a good chance of winning.
   Concerning the high chances of winning, the project's internet site
   (www.flashmoney.ru) announces that every one in four bets is a winning
   one.
   <p>When speaking to reporters the project's creators give much higher
   figures, claiming that the chance of winning in Flash Slot game
   amounts to 90-95%. (For comparison, the chance of winning in online
   casinos currently runs between 95% and 98%). In order to experience
   the thrill of mobile gaming, users have to own a cell phone capable of
   supporting Java, WAP and GPRS technologies. To begin playing the Flash
   Slot game, the user has to adjust the WAP and GPRS settings, download
   the game using either the phone or a computer connected to the
   Internet, register in the system (once again, using the Internet) and
   put money into his game account. In order to start the game the user
   enters the name of his account and the password given during
   registration. This information is then passed onto the gaming server
   "using a highly stable cryptographic algorithm", to quote the
   service's creators. The service's users can make bets ranging from 1
   to 1500 rubles (~3.3 cents to $50), and creators of Flash Slot promise
   maximum winnings of 4.5 million rubles ($150,000).
   <p>The owners of the online casino claim that they are carrying out their
   activities in accordance with a license given by Russia's State
   Committee on Sport and Physical Culture for a period of five years.
   However, the analysts note that until now the TimEx advertising group
   has had no connections with the gaming business, and it remains an
   open question whether mobile phone owners should trust the new project
   with their money.
   <p>An additional problem is that in order to begin playing in the mobile
   casino, the potential client has to perform a number of actions,
   involving both online and offline apects. The registration has to be
   done via the Internet, and replenishing the payments account can be
   done using five different systems of web money. However, in order to
   use the web money program the user has to perform certain offline
   actions, such as buying a card (for example, YandexMoney) which then
   can be activated through the Internet or using bank or postal money
   transfers to replenish the account. All of this just might be too much
   bother to get involved in a nameless project and to spend your money
   on it.
   <p>But even if the Flash Money project fails, its place is sure to be
   taken by other market players who have a real expertise and a
   respected trademark backing them. For example, the Russian branch of
   Microgaming Group, which runs the online Goldchip (Goldfishka) casino,
   has already announced that it sees mobile casinos as a promising
   segment of its future work. "We are ready to supply the mobile gaming
   business with our experience, reputation, honesty guarantees and
   international standards of client service," said John Huse, the online
   casino's marketing director.
   <p>"We would like to offer our present and future clients an opportunity
   to gamble both online and from a cell phone using the same payments
   account." Such a technical solution would be optimal for Russia's
   thriving population of online casino players because it would free
   them from the worry of replenishing their account using their mobile
   phone. Overall, Goldchip's management believes that mobile casinos
   should not be separated from online ones, but instead should be seen
   as two components of one service.
   <p>Perhaps the best solution that can be offered in this case is the
   close affiliation of a mobile casino services provider with one or
   several cellular network operators. Such an affiliation would permit
   the service's creators to offer their clients a practically cashless
   method of settling financial issues, which will in turn make the
   mobile casino a truly mobile business. There are, of course, certain
   undercurrents in this sea of opportunity, as this service cannot be
   offered to mobile phone subscribers who pay for the operator's
   services using a credit system for fear of a failure to pay ballooning
   game bills. However, considering that the majority of mobile
   subscribers currently use the system of pre-payment, this issue should
   not present too many problems for the accounting departments of cell
   network majors.
   <p>And while it is too early to evaluate the results of the mobile casino
   projects offered by both MegaFon and Flash Money, it is not too early
   to say that mobile gaming is here to stay. The window of opportunity
   is wide open and the only question that remains is: who will make the
   most of it? Will it be domestic providers, or cellular network
   operators, or international majors with previous experience? The
   answers to those questions is just around the corner, as Russia's
   mobile services market is one of the fastest growing branches of the
   country's economy.
