<h>Invitation to a Degraded World

   <h>By Jonathan Schell

   <h>Introduction by Tom Engelhardt

   <p>What a world! Everyone his own auteur. Everybody from CIA agents and
   Presidential political consultants to Osama bin Laden directing his
   own movie or unreality TV show. Of course, why should we be surprised?
   When it comes to saleable products, illusion Hollywood-style has been
   up there with weaponry as a major American export success for
   countless years. And the world has paid attention. I can't claim that
   Osama bin Laden ever saw The Towering Inferno or any of the
   action-adventure dramas where subways barrel down streets, blimps
   threaten crowded stadiums, or terrorists unleash nuclear weapons on an
   unsuspecting world. But retro-fundamentalist though he might be, and
   no matter how often he invokes the Arabian peninsula of centuries ago,
   he's a distinctly modern man.

   <p>Without the camera -- and the knowledge that, whatever you do wherever
   you are, the camera will somehow be there to catch the moment (viz.
   Abu Ghraib) and then the TV news will be ready and willing to play it
   again, and again, and again -- the attacks of 9/11 would have been
   almost inconceivable. They would have made next to no sense. They
   were, after all, planned and organized as fodder for the TV news, as
   Osama's Hollywood-style spectacle, his "export" to be viewed by the
   world. Similarly, George Bush's illusion-based bubble-presidency had
   been planned and organized as an ongoing spectacle of controlled
   imagery from early on -- from those imaginary mushroom clouds rising
   over our cities to that aircraft-carrier strut. After all, every
   publicly made argument for our little Iraqi war that won't end was an
   illusion, and that's stopped no one in the administration, then or
   now.

   <p>If there hadn't been an even grander illusion evoked by the event that
   began it all, nothing would have developed as it did. As columnist
   James Carroll writes this week in the Boston Globe:

     <p>"After decades [following the A-bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]
     of implicitly waiting for the mushroom cloud to appear over the
     nation, we saw the clouds of ash rising from the World Trade Center
     as a version of that horror. As I heard the scholar John Dower
     observe, the use of the term 'Ground Zero' in New York is an
     unconscious appropriation of the authentic Ground Zeros in Japan.
     That is why 9/11 traumatized us out of all proportion to the scale
     of destruction, which, while tragic, was hardly world-historic."

   <p>Or put another way: With the help of those camera-ready images, those
   unbearable shots of the two towers crumbling, and then crumbling
   again, and yet again, director Osama bin Laden, a man of exceedingly
   grandiose ambitions and distinctly limited resources, managed on the
   proverbial shoe-string budget to create his own apocalyptic film in
   lower Manhattan (though not in Washington, where the low-slung
   Pentagon, proved far less photogenic). With the help of a little
   dismally good luck in the category of destruction, he brought home
   nuclear-holocaust-style images that had until then, for Americans,
   been confined to a world of on-screen illusion; hence the almost
   immediate and blanket adoption of "Ground Zero" in the media and in
   everyday conversation for the site where the Twin Towers fell. And he
   did so with box-cutters, mace, and airplanes, not with WMD. What
   resulted was a fearful illusion that far exceeded a fearful reality,
   and so launched a presidency based on a principle of illusion onto the
   path of full-scale war in the Middle East, and into the sort of
   disaster -- the sort of reality -- that is painfully unphotogenic,
   that in the end no illusions can completely cover up.

   <p>Even in our world, reality still does have a way of biting back. If
   the Iraqis weren't quite in the mood to wave little flags, if reality
   (however buried in illusion) insists every now and then on making
   itself felt, well, that may be inconvenient indeed; but as Jonathan
   Schell indicates in the piece that follows, we're less far than we
   might imagine from a world in which an Orwellian formula like
   "illusion is reality" could indeed pass muster -- as it already seems
   to in the White House.

   <p>Schell's piece, "Invitation to a Degraded World," is as well a preview
   for a new magazine, Final Edition, just being launched and closed down
   at one and the same moment. Its editor is Wallace Shawn and he's been
   kind enough to let me post the piece. In a world where nothing happens
   just once, the idea of a magazine that appears and disappears in the
   flicker of a single issue appeals to me. Of his magazine, Shawn writes
   in a brief introduction:

     <p>"In confusing times and bad times, it seems natural to collect
     around oneself a group of friends and people one trusts, to try to
     figure things out. So that's what this is. It's not going to be an
     institution, because I don't think everything has to be an
     institution, and sometimes the impulse to make things permanent can
     be a symptom of the grandiosity that is part of our problem. So
     that's why this magazine is going out of business after its first
     issue and has therefore been given the name FINAL EDITION."

   <p>The sole issue of the magazine (being distributed by Seven Stories
   Press) includes, in addition to the Schell essay, a piece by Shawn, a
   Noam Chomsky interview (also done by Shawn), a Mark Strand poem, and a
   story about New York in the wake of 9/11 by Deborah Eisenberg. Tell
   your local bookstore to order it. Tom

<h>Invitation to a Degraded World

     <h>By Jonathan Schell

     <p>Ever since September 11, 2001, and the "war on terror" it
     occasioned, the very quality of public events -- their grain, their
     tenor, their style, if you like -- has seemed to undergo a certain
     deterioration, as if from that day forward history was being
     authored by a third-rate writer rather than a master, or was being
     compelled, even as it visited increasing suffering on real people,
     to follow the plot of a bad comic book. Not the representation of
     the events but the actual events, not the renderings of the
     characters involved but those characters themselves, not the
     telling of the story but the story itself -- all seem to have
     become crasser, coarser, woven of shoddier materials.

     <p>The tone was perhaps set by the sudden appearance of Osama bin
     Laden, a mass murderer who came across at the same time as a
     comic-book, caricature villain -- a man whom it would be impossible
     to take seriously if he had not killed so many people. The plan
     that he brought to fruition on September 11 was lifted whole out of
     any number of action comics, video games, or disaster movies, most
     of which end up with buildings blowing up, the more the better.
     (For example, in the most recent Terminator movie, The Rise of the
     Machines, starring the current governor of California, scarcely any
     standing structure shown on camera survives for more than a few
     minutes, and the movie winds up with a nuclear holocaust.)

     <p>Bin Laden's choice of spectacle obviously was contrived to match
     this stock scene. He lacked any capacity even to slightly dent the
     military power of the United States, so he delivered his blow to
     the nation's psyche instead. What better means than to turn its
     most common fantasies into horrifying life? He was assisted in his
     aim by accident. The towers had been designed to withstand airplane
     crashes. Perhaps that's why, immediately after the attack, the
     authorities in New York failed to give timely warning that the
     towers might come down. Yet they did come down, and when they did
     the emotional power of the catastrophe was magnified a
     hundred-fold. The attacks alone would have been an event of the
     first order; but it was the belief-defying, heart-crushing fall of
     the towers that knocked history off its course. (What would the
     world be like now if the girders holding up the buildings had
     managed to withstand the fires? Would there have been a Camp X-ray
     in Guantanamo, a war in Iraq, a global "war on terror"?)

     <p>As it was, the towers' collapse added an element of the uncanny to
     the fantasy made real by bin Laden. Yet although the scale of the
     crime was new, his strategy was hardly original. Terrorists have
     long compensated for their military weakness by creating the
     greatest possible spectacle with their bloody acts. They work in a
     symbolic realm. Real destruction and real deaths are only the means
     to accomplish their psychological effects. It's a strategy that
     cannot succeed without the de facto cooperation of the news media,
     which are routine exploiters for commercial purposes of all
     varieties of violence and destruction, from the local murder or
     fire in the warehouse to the latest hurricane. (How often does a
     meeting of negotiators, or a city council or parliament lead the
     news?) Their habits have guaranteed that the terrorists get all the
     coverage they hope for.

     <p>These media have in addition been busy in recent years scrambling
     reality and fantasy for entertainment purposes. A watershed was the
     coverage of the car chase in which the Los Angeles police pursued
     the white Bronco carrying O.J. Simpson, fleeing arrest for the
     alleged murder of his wife. Like the September 11 attacks, the
     Simpson episode recreated in the real world a type of scene -- in
     this instance, the car-chase -- that had been seen endlessly in
     movies and on television. What was sensational in the event was not
     any intrinsic drama (all you could see were a couple of cars
     driving along a highway) but the fact that the stale fictional
     scene was being lived out by real people. Ghoulish criminal cases,
     always popular, soon became the main stock-in-trade of television
     news -- infotainment. Soon came "reality" television, which
     reversed the process of the Simpson chase. If infotainment started
     with real events and turned them into de facto soap operas, reality
     television started with soap operas and spiced them up by adding
     "real" elements (consisting mostly of people being serially kicked
     off the shows).

     <p>It goes without saying that movie mayhem and reality television
     have no moral likeness to September 11. However, the news media's
     longstanding symbiosis with violent criminals along with their
     infection of reality with fantasy provided models for bin Laden's
     action as well as a global stage on which it would appear and be
     guaranteed unlimited coverage. Bin Laden strove for maximum effect
     with his crime, and he was granted it. At the time, it seemed that
     everyone was saying or writing, "Everything has changed." (I also
     wrote it, in a column right after the attack.) But in this
     reaction, felt as defiance of bin Laden, was there not also a kind
     of surrender -- not, to be sure, exactly to him, but to his debased
     style of thinking, his understanding of how the world works? What
     was damaged was not only the quality of political discussion and
     decision-making but something that might be called the dignity of
     the real.

     <p>Surely our reaction suited bin Laden well. He had no power to
     "change everything" unless the government of the United States
     agreed. Then everything could change.

     <p>The government of the United States did agree. And a lot of things
     -- if not everything -- did change. President Bush seemed to accept
     Bin Laden's invitation to enter into the world of an apocalyptic
     comic book. Even today, it may be hard to think of any response to
     September 11 as excessive. A great atrocity had been committed. A
     great reaction was needed. But was it necessary or wise to divide
     every person and government on earth into two camps -- the good,
     the lovers of freedom, who are "with us," and the "evil-doers" who
     hate the good ones for their very goodness, and "who are against
     us"? -- as if no other evils or horrors existed on earth to compel
     the attention of human beings?

     <p>The comic-book aspect became even more pronounced when the
     President turned himself into a sort of real life action figure,
     donning a pilot's suit and landing on the deck of the USS Abraham
     Lincoln to declare success in the Iraq war (though in his National
     Guard service, in which he was trained as a pilot, he was grounded
     for failing to show up for a physical). But the fullest realization
     of a fantasy world built on the foundation of September 11 was the
     Republican convention, where a collection of villains abroad was
     blurred into one mass of evil-doers who were in turn blurred with
     John Kerry, depicted as their domestic accomplice. Iraq, descending
     in actuality into anarchy, was presented as an inspiring example of
     democracy for the entire Middle East. Hidden behind the visions of
     a glorious future -- the favorite tense of the demagogue -- rose
     the pile of corpses, Iraqi and American. It was a further curious
     demonstration of the power of illusion that bin Laden himself
     slipped through the administration's fingers, as if the actual
     villain of September 11 had been dissolved in the fantasy his act
     set in motion.

     <p>Each country that plunges into nightmare -- whether Germany under
     Hitler, the Soviet Union under the Bolsheviks, Chile under
     Pinochet, or, for that matter, Iraq under Saddam Hussein -- travels
     there along its own path. The American political system -- based on
     free elections, the rights of citizens, and the rule of law -- is,
     though under the severest pressure, still available for use. If it
     is lost, and the full American nightmare descends, there will be
     many causes. They will include the militarization of foreign
     policy, global imperial ambition, the loss of balance among the
     branches of government, the erosion of civil liberties, and the
     overwhelming influence of corporate money and power over political
     life -- all present before Osama bin Laden made his appearance. But
     at every step of the way the skids will be greased by the national
     capacity, conferred by the media and exploited by politicians, to
     produce and consume illusion, which, though hardly an American
     monopoly, may be the specific form of corruption most dangerous to
     American democracy.

     <p>Once, observers imagined that we were entering an information age,
     but they were wrong. It is a misinformation age. The stupendous
     machinery of modern media has reached into every cranny of American
     life. Its outlets have been posted in every household, like a
     mechanical standing army. The steady, mild propaganda of
     advertising has long saturated the home for hours every day, the
     mental equivalent of low-level radiation. Now the public is being
     dosed with more virulent stuff. The standing army has been given
     increasingly insistent political marching orders. Stalin and Mao,
     confined mainly to radios and megaphones, could only dream of such
     penetration of daily life by their propaganda apparatuses.

     <p>The injection of fantasy into the real offends the aesthetic sense,
     but the true price is paid in blood -- in the torture of prisoners,
     in the launch of wars. If a grasp of reality and the constitutional
     machinery to act upon it remain intact, then every other ill can be
     addressed. But if these are lost, the capacity to recover is lost
     with it, and the game is over.
