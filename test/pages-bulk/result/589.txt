   <h>Beautiful snail: The aplysia californicus is a smart slug that may
   unlock the secrets of memory

   <p>Dec. 6, 2004 issue - To say that Aplysia Californicus is one of
   nature's least glamorous beasts would be too kind. A hermaphroditic
   marine snail with mottled purple skin, it keeps to itself, responding
   to disturbances by emitting a murky fluid that stains the water around
   it. Its "brain," if you can call it that, is stunningly simple, with
   only a few thousand oversize neurons. It is not, in short, a likely
   candidate for glory in the animal kingdom. But a few years from now,
   much of the baby-boom generation may be greatly indebted to this
   unprepossessing little creature. Aplysia may look homely, but to
   scientists hoping to develop memory-enhancing medicine, it is a thing
   of beauty.

   <p>Thanks to the neurological research of Nobel laureate Eric Kandel and
   others, Aplysia's minimal nervous system is helping scientists to make
   sense of how memory works on the biochemical level. The molecules of
   memory in sea slugs, it turns out, aren't that different from some of
   those in humans. They are now one of the many inspirations for drugs
   that may someday ward off the forgetfulness that plagues so many
   people as they grow older. As Americans' average age creeps upward,
   the search for medicines that will keep them sharp is accelerating.
   "We're all very, very avidly grinding up cells trying to get at the
   molecules," says Dr. Scott Small of Columbia University Medical
   Center.

   <p>No pill to improve memory, aside from alternative remedies of dubious
   effectiveness, is currently on the market. But several small biotech
   companies are launching drugs grounded in the latest research, with a
   few already in the early stages of clinical trials that could be
   finished in as little as "two years, if we're lucky," says Kandel, who
   is now at CUMC and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Some of the
   most promising candidates have their roots in Aplysia studies. Others
   take their cues from even more improbable sources like the molecular
   consequences of smoking, focusing on some of the same receptors that
   nicotine targets. (Who knew it had benefits?) "These are very exciting
   times for treating memory loss," says Steven Siegelbaum, a
   neuroscientist at CUMC and HHMI. And with trials soon to yield
   results, they're about to get even more exciting.

   <p>It has been a long, hard slog to reach this point. Scientists now know
   that the brain-relying on chemical cascades kicked off by
   neurotransmitters-first stores short-term information in the
   prefrontal cortex and then transforms selected bits into long-term
   memories via the hippocampus, a sea-horse-shaped region tucked deep in
   the folds of the temporal lobe above the ear. Even such fundamental
   knowledge was unthinkable some 30 years ago. The concept of memory is
   so complex that many midcentury researchers shied away from studying
   it, claiming any attempt would be an example of futile reductionism.
   Little progress was made before 1953, when one of medicine's more
   famous patients arrived on the scene. An epileptic, H.M. suffered
   intractable, frequent seizures until he had both of his temporal lobes
   removed. Now deprived of his hippocampus, H.M., like the protagonists
   of the movies "Memento" and "50 First Dates," was unable to form new
   memories of people, places or things.

   <p>The unfortunate patient's case clearly signaled that the hippocampus
   played a central role in memory formation. But two more decades would
   go by before researchers figured out why or how. "The biology of
   memory storage was really a black hole," says Kandel. "We knew very
   little about it 25 years ago." Kandel's idea-to use a deceptively
   simple organism to solve a complex problem-met with skepticism. No
   wonder, says Siegelbaum, a longtime collaborator of Kandel's: "Most
   people were working on very basic problems. It was sort of an
   audacious goal at the time."

   <p>But audacious goals often drive equally audacious science, and Kandel,
   working with his sea snails, was on to something. Because the snails
   had such large neurons, and so few of them, Kandel was able to
   identify the individual nerve cells responsible for specific
   behaviors. Those nerve cells appeared to rely on some of the same
   biochemical processes that power the brains of more-advanced animals.
   Aplysia californicus turned out to be a good model for molecular
   memory processes in humans. Both species rely on the neural messenger
   cyclic AMP, which modulates a protein called CREB that can turn genes
   on or off. CREB is the brain's sculptor: it forms memories by
   reshaping the synapses, or spaces between neurons. So changes in
   cyclic AMP levels-and corresponding changes in CREB levels-affect the
   brain's ability to remodel its synapses. Less CREB equals less
   memory-making ability.

   <p>The practical results of this work, as well as extensive follow-up
   tests in mice and rats, are several new drugs now in early development
   at Memory Pharmaceuticals, founded in part by Kandel in 1998. MEM1414
   is the inheritor of the Aplysia findings. Cyclic AMP, the
   neurotransmitter that dictates CREB levels, is normally degraded in
   the brain by enzymes called phosphodiesterases. By inhibiting those
   enzymes' activity, MEM14 appears to boost CREB levels and enhance the
   brain's long-term memory functions; researchers hope it will enhance
   long-term memory in patients with age-related forgetfulness and even
   ward off the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, even though the two
   ailments are not related. There's also MEM1917, a drug similar to
   1414; MEM1003, which protects neurons from damaging overloads of
   calcium, and MEM3454, a schizophrenia treatment that targets a
   receptor also known to respond to nicotine. Researchers think that
   some schizophrenics ease their symptoms, including loss of memory
   function, by self-medicating with cigarettes.

   <p>Other companies are also in the hunt. Helicon has a phosphodiesterase
   inhibitor of its own. Sention, cofounded by Mark Bear of the Picower
   Center for Learning and Memory at MIT, has gone chemically "upstream"
   of cyclic AMP and CREB, modulating the neurotransmitters that direct
   the synthesis of proteins the brain uses as the basic building blocks
   of memory. Its intriguing new drug, C105 (which is largely under wraps
   for now), is in phase II trials. Cortex Pharmaceuticals, one of the
   oldest memory-booster firms, is focusing elsewhere, on molecules
   called ampakines, which modulate "AMPA receptors" in the brain that
   can strengthen the synapses. The company already has one drug, CX516,
   through phase II trials, although it is too weak to be a practical
   prescription option. A revved-up version, CX717, is in the works, and
   several other companies are also developing their own ampakines.
