     <p>Thanks to everyone who responded to the recent Pay Equity Survey.
     The preliminary data from the survey,combined with data from the
     Massachusetts Teachers Association (MTA), indicate that the
     districts listed below currentlyhave pay equity (defined as nurses
     employed full-time by a school district having the same salary
     schedule as the teachersand other professional support personnel in
     that specific district).
     <p>Please review this list. If you think that any of thedata is
     incorrect or if you have additional districts to add, please
     contact Barbara Connolly at connolly@msno.org. We received some
     conflicting data. Pay equity committee members may be contacting
     you to verifyinformation. The data collection and analysis continue
     and complete results will be available later in the year.

     <p>We lost our case on the Appeals Court level. After the decision of
     the Superior Court I guess that was expected, but still very
     disappointing. There was no hearing and no opportunity for
     arguments. The Appeals Court just reviewed the case. Neil Rossman,
     our attorney, was very disappointed as well. He felt very strongly
     about our case and did an excellent job in presenting it, but the
     judges just did not seem to understand. This is the end of the line
     for this case; however, the Swampscott case is still alive.

     <p>Even though we did not win in the courts, I think we should be
     proud of what we accomplished. We brought a lot of attention to the
     issue. When we began there were only 25 districts with equity and
     now there are nearly 90. And many of the districts without equity
     have made huge strides in their salary scales. I like to think that
     this progress is a direct result of our courage in initiating the
     lawsuit. There is still a long way to go and the quest for equity
     will not end with this. MSNO plans to continue to explore other
     avenues to achieve the pay equity goal.

     <p>Thank you to Ann Borges, Roberta Cobbett, Janice DiFillipo, Ann
     Greenbaum, Kathy Larson, Maureen Saunders, Joan Scheid, and Lee
     Thurston for their courage in joining me and MSNO in this suit.
     Every school nurse in the state owes them a great deal. And thanks
     also to each of you who so generously gave your financial and
     emotional support to this venture. Please contact me if you have
     any questions or any new ideas. If you would like a copy of the
     Appeals Court decision, contact Barbara Connolly at her msno.org

     "pay equity" to mean school nurses who are employed full-time by a
     school district have exactly the same salary schedule as the
     teachers and other professional support personnel (i.e. guidance
     counselors, librarians, adjustment counselors, speech therapists,
     etc.) in that specific district. This means that the school nurse
     can progress up all the steps (for seniority) and across all the
     columns (for education) that a teacher can.

      <p>On January 18, 2001, a hearing was held in Suffolk Superior Court
      on the Massachusetts Department of Education's Motion to Dismiss
         the suit filed by MSNO (Ann L. Greenbaum et. al. vs. Mass.
        Department of Education, et. al.) Unfortunately, Judge Thayer
      Freemont-Smith's opinion supported the Department of Education's
                             Motion to Dismiss.

     <p>We are now in the appeal process. Attorney Rossman filed an intent
      to appeal. The brief is due in mid-September. It is prepared and
     will be filed in a timely manner. We must now be patient again and
                wait for the next step in the legal process.

                         <h>Attention: School Nurses!
                             Pay Equity Survey
                       

       <p>We are attempting to form a list of districts which include pay
       equity for their school nurses. MSNO is frequently asked which
      districts have pay equity, especially for those who are entering
                                 bargaining.

     <p>So, if you are fortunate to have pay equity for the school nurses,
        please e-mail either Barbara Connolly at her msno.org e-mail
                address or cobbett@msno.org. Please be clear:
    <l>1. Do you have full equity with all other professional staff?
    <l>2. Do you have a separate pay scale for nurses, but one which gives
       pay equity?
    <l>3. Do you have a partial equity, working towards full?
    <l>4. Do you have a means for inclusion of diploma grads, in pay equity?
    <l>5. If so, must they be certified or can they be "certification
       exempt"?

     <p>This information will be helpful. Be patient if you are searching
     for specifics for your district, though. It will take us volunteers
     a bit of time to compile this information so that it can be useful
     to everyone. But it will only be of use if YOU send us your
     information to start!

                             Swampscott, MA. 01907

    <p>The following information summarizes the history leading up to this
                                    action:

     <p>The Massachusetts Education Reform Act of 1993 amended the teacher
     certification act to include school nurses. The position of "school
     nurse" in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is now defined by
     statute. Despite the fact that since June 1993 school nurse
     certification requirements are equal to, and in some areas even
     more rigorous than, those for teachers and other non-classroom
     based educational support personnel, most professional school
     nurses in Massachusetts are denied compensation equal to other
     professionals employed by the school system.
     <p>It is MSNO's contention that the practice of salary inequities
     ultimately impacts the quality of health care delivered to
     students, since it is difficult to attract and retain school nurses
     with expertise in critical thinking, decision making, program
     management, health education and counseling, program planning, and
     community outreach, when competitive salaries are not offered.
     <p>Groups of nurses in individual school systems have historically had
     little success in securing equitable contracts. Despite the current
     statewide and national recognition of the positive impact of school
     nurses on children's health, the expanded public health role of
     school nurses, and the need for their professional education, many
     of Massachusetts' school nurses report that they continue to feel
     undervalued, unempowered, and isolated. In spite of their many
     attempts to campaign for adequate compensation, comparable to other
     professionals in the school system, they have continuously been
     denied pay equity.
     <p>Consequently in September 1997 the Massachusetts School Nurse
     Organization (MSNO) formed a "Pay Equity Committee" and began a
     statewide effort to address the problem of school nurse salary
     inequities.
     <p>In January 1998 MSNO conducted a statewide survey that confirmed
     that only a small minority of the school districts in the
     Commonwealth pay school nurses on the same pay scale as their
     professional counterparts with equal educational and certification
     requirements. (The survey report, entitled Report on the Current
     State of Salary Inequities for Professional School Nurses in
     Massachusetts, is available from MSNO.) The vast majority of school
     nurses in Massachusetts are significantly under-compensated.
     <p>In November 1999 a complaint was filed in Essex County Superior
     Court. Plaintiffs were Ann Greenbaum, RN and Roberta Cobbett, RN,
     school nurses in the Swampscott Public Schools. Defendants were the
     Chairman of the Swampscott School Committee, the Superintendent of
     the Swampscott School Department and the duly elected Swampscott
     School Committee.
     <p>On July 25, 2000 a lawsuit was filed in Suffolk County Superior
     Court by Attorney Neil Rossman, Civil Action No. #00-3348-F.

     <p>The Massachusetts Attorney General's office is representing the
     Department of Education in the matter of the Pay Equity lawsuit.
     The Assistant Attorney General for Administrative Law is filing a
     "Motion to Dismiss" and has submitted this motion to MSNO's
     attorney, Neil Rossman. Attorney Rossman will submit a response to
     this motion. It will be the "Opposition of Plaintiffs to
     Defendants' Motion to Dismiss." The Motion to Dismiss and the
     response will then be filed with the court and will be reviewed by
     a judge. We will keep you updated on this website as the legal
     proceedings unfold.

     <p>Newspapers across the state remain interested in doing articles on
     school nurses generally and on the pay equity issue in particular.
     Journalists are very willing to pay attention to nurses. A recently
     published book entitled From Silence to Voice: What Nurses Know and
     Must Communicate to the Public by Bernice Buresh and Suzanne Gordon
     presents a practical guide that provides approaches to increase
     nurses' visibility and voice in the media. We have found during
     this campaign for pay equity that the media is very interested in
     our issues. Do not be intimidated. Contact your local newspapers
     and cable stations to publicize the pay equity issue. We need to be
     heard and each of you can make a difference in your area. Please
     feel free to contact Barbara Connolly at her msno.org e-mail
     address or cobbett@msno.org with questions.

     <p>On October 26, 2000 The New Bedford Standard-Times ran an article
     entitled "School Nurses Keep Busy" in which they featured the
     nurses in the Freetown/Lakeville School District.

     <p>The South Weekly edition of The Boston Globe
     on Sunday October 8, 2000 carried a feature article entitled
     "School Nurses Demand More Pay." Nurses from Duxbury, Hanover and
     Freetown/Lakeville were spotlighted. On October 22, 2000 The Boston
     Globe published the following letter-to-the-editor, submitted by
     Barbara Connolly on behalf of MSNO, in response to comments made in
     the article by Hanover's superintendent of schools.

                        <h>Pay Equity for School Nurses
                           <h>(Letter-to-the Editor)

     <p>A book published in 1989 entitled Just a Nurse stated that "the
     public wants a nurse to be a warm, caring human being. The
     intellectual acumen needed to practice professional nursing is
     rarely understood." This statement applies to school
     superintendents and school committees who rarely seem to recognize
     the role of school nurses and certainly do not seem to understand
     the "intellectual acumen" required of these nurses.

     <p>The practice of professional nursing by school nurses occurs within
     the complex and unpredictable setting of the educational
     institution, not in a medical facility. A school nurse usually
     functions as a sole practitioner in her school. The Comprehensive
     School Health Manual, published by the Massachusetts Department of
     Public Health in 1995, reminds us that the comprehensive and
     expanding public health nature of school nursing practice demands
     an educational and skill level that enables the school nurse to
     meet the current health needs of the students and staff. Why then,
     do the majority of school districts in the Commonwealth continue to
     devalue the nursing profession by refusing to pay nurses on the
     same salary scale as teachers and other non-classroom based
     educational support staff?

     <p>It is the Massachusetts School Nurse Organization's contention that
     the practice of salary inequities ultimately impacts the quality of
     health care delivered to students, since it is difficult to attract
     and retain school nurses with expertise in critical thinking,
     decision making, program management, health education and
     counseling, program planning, and community outreach, when
     competitive salaries are not offered.

    <p>It appears that school districts which deny school nurses pay equity
             are violating the Education Reform Act's statement of
        nondiscrimination. A summary of the issues in the lawsuit are as
                                    follows:

    <l>1. under the Education Reform Act school nurses are required to be
       certified like all other educational professionals and to have a
       bachelor's degree as a prerequisite to certification...
    <l>2. school nurses are professional educators, as are all other
       non-classroom based educational support staff...
    <l>3. under Education Reform school nurses are the legal equal of other
       certified educators...
    <l>4. in spite of having to meet the same requirements as classroom
       teachers pay equity and professional standing are denied the
       school nurses...
    <l>5. salary schedules for school nurses are much lower than all other
       educational professionals...

   <p>Also, the Education Reform Act states (Section 99 of Statutes of 1993,
       Chapter 71):

   "All programs and actions undertaken under the provisions of this act
       shall be conducted in a manner reflecting and encouraging a policy
       of nondiscrimination and equal opportunity for members of minority
       groups and women. All officials...of any school department...shall
       take affirmative steps to ensure equality of opportunity in the
       internal affairs of such departments...Each school district
       department...shall adopt measures to ensure equal opportunity in
       the areas of hiring, promotion,...rates of compensation and

   <p>The MSNO Board of Directors has voted to support this legal action to
       achieve pay equity for school nurses. More information will be
   forthcoming to every school nurse in the State regarding how they can
    lend their encouragement and financial support to this undertaking.

                 <h>MSNO Advances with Pay Equity Legal Action
                                 

     <p>The MSNO Pay Equity Committee wishes to thank all who have
     contributed to the MSNO Legal Action Fund. In the short time since
     we have informed our membership and other
     school nurse colleagues of our legal action process and our need
     for funding this action, we have raised $17,000. The requested
     amount to contribute is $50. Individual school nurses'
     contributions have ranged from $25 to $1,000. We thank you
     profoundly! Since we anticipate needing $50,000, we hope that those
     who have not yet contributed will do so soon. Everyone's
     contribution is necessary if this legal action is to succeed.

     <p>We have had a wonderful show of support from local unions, with
     donations ranging from $50 to $500! The MTA has been contacted by
     Linda Salmonsen, requesting that MTA contribute financially, as
     well as to encourage the support of the individual locals. NASN's
     Legal Defense Fund and the Connecticut Association of School Nurses
     have also been most generous in contributing to our legal action.

     <p>With the filing of this legal suit, the MSNO Pay Equity Committee
     will post various sample letters that school nurses may use to
     request contributions from their local unions and/or friends of
     school nursing-either private individuals or organizations which
     have supported school nurses and school health services.

     <p>We will keep you posted as this legal action progresses.

                     <h>Honor Roll of Contributing Locals
                    ___________________________________

     <p>Several local unions have made generous contributions to the MSNO
     Legal Action Fund, such as Lanesborough, Dighton-Rehoboth,
     Brookline, Hanover, Westford and Central Berkshire. Ask your local
     if they have contributed. Show them the information on this website
     or in your newsletter which describes the Pay Equity lawsuit. Ask
     them to make a contribution to show their support financially. We
     are planning an "Honor Roll of Contributing Locals" to show our
     appreciation for their support for this legal action and for their
     school nurses.
