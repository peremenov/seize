   <p>The lands of Balfour, or Bal-orr, lie in the parish of Markinch in
   Fife. The Orr is a tributary of the River Leven. According to
   tradition, the lands were given to Siward, a Northumbrian, during the
   reign of Duncan I. The earliest dependable record of the name is a
   charter of William the Lion in favour of Michael de Balfour around
   1196. Sir Duncan de Balfour supported the cause of Sir William Wallace
   and was killed at the Battle of Blackironside in 1298, although the
   engagement was a great victory for the Scots. Sir John Balfour of
   Balfour died in 1375 and his estates passed to his only daughter,
   Margaret, wife of Sir Robert de Bethune. The Bethunes of Balfour were
   to flourish and figure prominently in Scottish history through such
   personalities as Cardinal Bethune and Mary Beaton, celebrated as one
   of the `four Maries', the ladies-in-waiting of Mary, Queen of Scots.
   The Balfours continued through the descendants of Adam, the brother of
   Sir John Balfour, who married into the powerful Macduff Earls of Fife.
   Adam died of wounds sustained at the Battle of Durham in 1346 and his
   son was brought up in the household of the earl. He prospered greatly
   by his family connections and from him descend the Balfours of
   Denmylne, Forret, Torry and Kinloch. James Balfour of Denmylne was
   killed at the siege of Roxburgh in 1460 and his son John died, along
   with the greater part of the Scottish nobility, at the Battle of
   Flodden in 1513. Sir Michael Balfour was Comptroller of the Household
   to Charles I and fought for the king's cause during the civil war. Sir
   James Balfour, son of Sir Michael Balfour of Denmylne, was created
   Lord Lyon, King of Arms, in June 1630. He was a distinguished heraldic
   scholar and antiquary who wrote a number of important treatises on
   heraldry. He was also a chronicler of the Scottish monarchy, and his
   Annals and Short Passages of State was published in book form almost
   two centuries later, in 1824. Sir Andrew Balfour, Baronet, also of the
   house of Denmylne, was a distinguished botanist and founder of the
   Botanic Garden of Edinburgh (which now flourishes as the Royal
   Scottish Botanical Garden). He was also a noted physician and the
   first president of the Royal College of Physicians in Scotland. He
   died in 1694.

   <p>Sir James Balfour of Forret was knighted in 1674 and elevated to the
   Supreme Court in Edinburgh taking the judicial title, `Lord Forret'.
   He was subsequently appointed judge of the High Court of Justiciary.
   Another branch of the family, the Balfours of Burleigh, were raised to
   the peerage with the title of `Lord Balfour of Burleigh', in 1606. The
   fifth Lord Balfour of Burleigh brought the family's fortunes to a very
   low ebb at the start of the eighteenth century. He formed a strong
   romantic attachment to a girl considered to be of `unsuitable' family,
   and his father sent him abroad, hoping that time and distance would
   cool his ardour. The infatuated Master of Burleigh swore his undying
   love to the girl and promised that if she married anyone else in his
   absence he would kill him. Time passed and the girl put aside
   Balfour's threat and married Henry Stenhouse, a local schoolmaster. On
   his eventual return the Master of Burleigh made immediate enquiry
   after his love, and on learning the truth, sought out the schoolmaster
   and shot him in the shoulder. Stenhouse died of his wounds some days
   later. Balfour was tried before the High Court in August 1709 and
   despite a most ingenious defence he was sentenced to death. He escaped
   from prison by changing clothes with his sister, and he went into
   hiding. He succeeded to the title on the death of his father in 1713.
   He joined the cause of the `Old Pretender' in the rebellion of 1715,
   for which he was declared a traitor. His title and estates were
   forfeited by an Act of Attainder in November 1715. He died unmarried
   in 1757. The attainder was reversed in 1869 in favour of Mary, the
   heir of Lord Balfour's sister, who had bravely taken his place in the
   condemned cell. Alexander, sixth Lord Balfour of Burleigh, was a
   Knight of the Thistle and Secretary of State for Scotland from 1895 to
   1903. Arthur James Balfour, who was descended from the Balfours of
   Balbirnie, was Prime Minister from 1902 to 1905, and was created Earl
   of Balfour in May 1922. In 1843, William Balfour of Trenabie in Orkney
   proved his descent from the principal family, and received a grant of
   supporters from the Lord Lyon, King of Arms, as representer and head
   of the house. The arms were rematriculated in 1936.
