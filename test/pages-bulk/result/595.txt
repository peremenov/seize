<h>The History of Fire Fighting

   <p>In recorded historical times, First Century Romans were the first
   known civilization to have a paid fire department. It consisted of
   about 7,000 fire fighters, who not only doused fires, but were also
   empowered with authority to police the streets in order to punish
   those who violated their fire prevention codes. An inventor by the
   name of Ctesibius devised the first known fire pump around 200 B.C.
   but the idea was lost, ironically, in the burning of Alexandria,
   Ctesibius´ home city. It wasn´t until A.D. 1500 that the fire pump was
   again re-invented. For many years throughout Europe and the American
   colonies fire-fighting equipment was extremely elementary, and not
   very effective. The Great London fire of 1666, which burned for 4 days
   and destroyed the city, encouraged the advancement of fire fighting by
   the invention of a two-person operated piston pump that was moved
   about fairly easily on wheels.

   <p>In 1648 Peter Stuyvesant, Governor of New Amsterdam (Now known as New
   York City) pioneered fire prevention for the New World by appointing
   fire inspectors with the power to impose fines for fire code
   violations, an idea he unknowingly copied from the Romans. In 1653
   Boston had its first "great fire," after which it adopted a fire code.
   A subsequent great fire" in 1679 destroyed the dockyard, warehouses,
   and 150 houses prompting them to import one of the early fire engines,
   a ten-person pump that was created by English inventor Richard
   Newsham. It wasn´t until 1743 that Thomas Lote constructed the first
   fire engine to be manufactured in the America´s.

   <p>In 1829 a steam-powered fire engine was invented, but fire fighters of
   the day were reluctant to accept it. In 1841, a self-propelled fire
   engine was invented, financed by a group of insurance companies. It
   was scoffed at by the firefighters of the time, who refused to use it.
   Finally, the insurance companies were forced to concede that the
   project was a failure. Eventually there was such an outcry by the
   public in Cincinnati, Ohio, that the fire fighters there were forced
   to adopt its use.

   <p>The first ladder wagon´s appeared in 1870 and the hose elevator was
   put in use around 1871. Gasoline engines were at first used either as
   pumping engines or as tractors to pull other apparatus. Eventually the
   two functions were combined, with one engine both propelling the truck
   and driving the pump. In modern times, equipment is most often diesel
   powered and has become extremely diverse and versatile, with many
   variations on the basic fire engine design. This enables firefighters
   to respond to many types of emergency situations with appropriate
   equipment at hand.
