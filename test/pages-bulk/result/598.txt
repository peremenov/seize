            <h>Ed Lu 
                       <h>Space Station Science officer

    <p>Ed Lu was NASA's science officer on the Expedition 7 mission to the
     International Space Station from April until October 2003. He and
     cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko were the first two-person crew to live
   board the Station following the loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia in
   February 2003. The crew flew to and returned from the Station aboard a
                           Russian Soyuz rocket.

                      <h>On riding the Soyuz spacecraft:
    <p>"I had the pleasure to fly twice on the Shuttle, and I can tell you
     the experience in Russia is very different," Lu said. "When you're
    launching on the Shuttle, it shakes a lot. It's like driving over a
    dirt road at 40 to 50 miles per hour." The vibrations are caused by
     the Shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters. Since the Soyuz rocket relies
    entirely on liquid-fuel engines, it's a much smoother ride. However,
    the Soyuz is a three-stage rocket, and there's a strong acceleration
   when the stages separate, particularly the last one. "When that thing
    went, if felt like we'd been kicked in the butt by a giant." Another
    difference was that he and Malenchenko were not allowed to carry as
    much with them on the Soyuz for their 6-month stay. Landing was also
    very different. For example, the Soyuz uses an ablative heat shield,
     which means it burns up as the craft re-enters the atmosphere. "I
   remember looking out the window watching pieces of our ship burn off,
   which is normal, but it's still a little bit disconcerting," he said.
        The Soyuz also uses a parachute attached to the side of the
   spacecraft. When it opens, the crew is hanging sidewise, spinning in a
                                  circle.

                   <h>On the International Space Station:
    <p>"The Space Station is like a big tube now," Lu said. "It's about the
     size of a large jetliner." As the Soyuz approached the Station, he
    said it "looked like a small model. It really feels like you're in a
      science fiction movie." With the smaller crew and fewer supplies
    coming up from Earth, keeping equipment operational was an important
       part of the crew's duties. "We spent a lot of time working on
    equipment," he said. "Another thing we spent a lot of time doing was
     exercise." The exercise paid off--Lu was one of the first American
   astronauts to return from a long-duraction spaceflight with almost no
   loss in bone density and little loss in muscle strength. The crew was
   given an "exercise prescription" for the work-out they had to perform.
     "And, I did extra on top of that on my own," Lu said. "I came back
   with less bone loss than anyone." His experience will help astronauts
    healthy when they begin making the long trips to other worlds. "When
     we do fly to Mars or asteroids or far away locations, it will take
    months," he said. "It could even take years." Lu said he enjoyed his
   stay on the Station. "It was a blast from start to finish. Towards the
   ending I was wishing it would last a little longer. I wasn't ready to
                              come home yet."

                 <h>On eating aboard the Space Station:
   <p>"The food up there is pretty good, actually," Lu said. However, while
   the food is tasty, it gets monotonous after a while, much like eating
     at your favorite restaurant every night would be. "For us, it's 3
   months before we get to eat somewhere else." That's why the crew looks
    forward to the arrival of the Progress cargo ship, carrying supplies
     from Earth. "It is a welcome thing, because it brings fresh food."
   Another welcome delivery of the Progress is odors. "Space Station has
     no smell whatsoever," Lu said, explaining that, because of the air
   circulation system, when you open a can of food, you can smell it only
     for seconds before the odor is circulated away. When the Progress
     docked, however, the astronauts could smell food inside. "When you
     opened the valve up, before you actually open the hatch, you could
    smell apples in the Space Station," he said. "We were looking at our
     watches (until it was time to open the hatch). Those things tasted
                                 terrific."

             <h>On playing the piano upside down in microgravity:
   <p>You can't do it. When you're upside down, "everything's reversed," Lu
       explained. "If you ever try it, it's not as easy as it looks."

                    <h>On the view from the Space Station:
   <p>"With binoculars, you can see airplanes in flight," he said. "You can
    see individual buildings. I even have a picture of my home. You can
     also see lots of craters on The Moon the surface of the Earth." Lu
    showed us a picture he took from the Space Station which showed the
   Moon and Mars next to each other in a single frame. "This is one of my
      favorite pictures from the mission, because it shows where we're
     going." Mars, which was closer to Earth than it had been in 60,000
    years when Lu was on the Station, put on quite a show for the crew.
   Ordinarily, it is difficult to see celestial objects from the Station
    while the lights are on, since the crew's eyes are adjusted for the
    brighter conditions. "Mars was bright enough last summer that it was
    always out the window," he said, explaining that it was visible even
                            with the lights on.

              <h>On being on a two-person crew with Malenchenko:
    <p>"I learned to like, believe it or not, Russian rap music," he said.
   "We got along great. We never had a single argument. We think a lot a
    like." He said that he and Malenchenko were fortunate that they had
    similar philosophies about the mission, and that they each worked to
                            be a good crewmate.
