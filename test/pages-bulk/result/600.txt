<h>   The Art of Work
<p>   Being unhappily employed can ruin your physical and emotional
   well-being. How do you find the ways to do the job you love and love
   the job you do?

<p>   Is it the American dream or a shaggy dog story? As a highly paid
   corporate manager of information technology, Stacy was successful in
   her career but personally unhappy being a cog in a giant wheel. When a
   round of layoffs left her at leisure, she consulted a career counselor
   to help her make use of her real interests: an affection for animals
   and a desire to be self-employed.
   
<p>   Instead of looking for another IT position, she started her own
   dog-grooming business. While it was a risky enterprise, she's ended up
   with more work than she can handle and plans to expand. "I didn't mind
   what I did before," she says, "but this is something I really love."
   
<p>   Considering the time and effort it takes, if our work isn't mentally
   stimulating or emotionally fulfilling, it's virtually impossible to
   live a satisfying life. And a job that's overly stressful is just
   plain unhealthful. Studies have linked job stress to everything from
   back pain to heart disease, says Thomas Pickering, M.D., director of
   the Behavioral Cardiovascular Health and Hypertension Program at
   Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City.
   
<p>   Are you ready to find work that's genuinely enjoyable? The first step
   is to believe that it's possible. Even if you can't make a complete
   career change--at least, not right away--you can take action to make
   your current situation happier and healthier. Here are solutions for
   three common career quandaries.
   
<h>   1. I'm sure there's something else I'd like to do. I"m just not sure
   what it is."
<p>   One way to clarify your situation is by taking a truth inventory:
<l>   - What is it that you like or dislike about your job?
<l>   - Have you had any great days at work? What made them so?
<l>   - Recall why you took the job in the first place. Were you passionate
   about certain aspects? Have they changed--or have you?
   
<p>   "Three-quarters of Americans are unhappy with their jobs, but
   typically they aren't exactly sure why," says Connecticut-based career
   coach Julie Jansen, author of I Don't Know What I Want, But I Know
   It's Not This. Yes, you may dislike your boss or your company, but "it
   may be something else that you haven't even thought about before," she
   says.
   
<p>   To find out what's missing, Jansen suggests a period of
   self-reflection. "You need to understand yourself from a values
   standpoint. What are your real interests? What skills do you have, or
   would you like to acquire? Most people never get a clear picture of
   their desires. They just say, 'I'm unhappy, so I'd better go look for
   a job.' And then they don't necessarily make the right choices."
   
<p>   If you're confused about your career options, explore what you find
   enjoyable outside of work, advises Massachusetts-based personal coach
   Cheryl Richardson, author of Stand Up for Your Life. Ask yourself the
   following questions:
   
<l>   - If your local bookstore could only have one section, which one would
   you hope they'd keep?
<l>   - Who are the passionate people around you, and what are they doing
   with their lives?
<l>   - What career would you like your children to pursue? Is that because
   you'd really like to pursue it yourself?
<l>   - Do you frequently date people with careers in a certain area? Is it
   possible that the career attracts you as much as the person does?
<l>   - If you won the lottery and were able to quit your job today, what
   would you do with your time?
   
<p>   Once you've determined what your real passions are, you can begin
   looking into careers that incorporate them. "Give yourself the space
   to try things out," says Richardson. "You may think you'd love a
   certain thing, but you don't when you actually do it. Other activities
   you'll love more than you thought you would."
   
<p>   There's no shame in changing careers more than once, she adds. "One
   study found that some people do it as many as seven times over the
   course of a lifetime."
