<h>     Active Adults Want Homes They've Always Dreamed About

<h>     By Kendall Carre

<p>     Merchandising for an active adult community starts with identifying
     today's active seniors. Todays 55-year-olds are a different breed
     than their counterparts of only a decade ago, and that means this
     market segment must be redefined.

<p>     For example, older adults will be retiring later, often for
     financial reasons but also for pure enjoyment.

<p>     When attempting to define todays active adults, there is one thing
     for certain: They are active. They eat healthier, exercise
     regularly, spend more time on hobbies and are living longer.

<p>     Their vision of a new home is closer to their dream home than
     anything theyve previously owned, right down to the interior
     design.

<p>     The interior merchandising for these homes should create a personal
     focus revolving around the individuals who will be living
     here, says Debra Newell, founder and president of Tustin, CA-based
     Ambrosia Interior Design, Inc.

     
<p>	    A good example comes from the 14 new model homes at Pulte/Del
     Webb's Sun City Lincoln Hills in Lincoln, CA, which Ambrosia is
     merchandising.

<p>     Ranging from just under 1,200 to more than 3,000 square feet, these
     homes are designed to appeal to boomers  in both architecture and
     merchandising. The homes are larger, with bigger kitchens and more
     space for entertaining. There is enough room for example, for a
     large dining table for family gatherings and there are special
     places for hobbies, home offices, exercise and relaxation.

<h>     Fill the Home With Their Favorite Things

<p>     A homes personalization is key to its appeal to active adults,
     Newell points out.

<p>     Buyers are looking at this home as the one they can finally do
     their way, he says. They want everything to be the nicest theyve
     ever owned.

<p>     Most buyers have owned and decorated several homes over the years.
     Theyve learned from their mistakes and want to fill this home with
     their favorite things.

<p>     If the buyers passion is cooking, they will spend a large amount of
     their option dollars on things like granite or Cesarstone
     countertops, and glazed cabinets with glass doors. adds Newell.

<p>     Buyers at Sun City Lincoln Hills are spending $50,000-$60,000 for
     architectural upgrades and options such as flooring and
     countertops.

<h>     Low Maintenance Is Another Hot Button

<p>     Although active adult home buyers desire the best in everything,
     they do not want a home that requires plenty of upkeep. Low
     maintenance and high quality are the hot buttons for these buyers,
     and creating a balance between the two is essential.

<p>     Newell says that the interiors of active adult homes should
     be lighter and brighter than what is found in a
     typical single-family home.

<p>     We see 35% less light as we get older, so the rooms are painted in
     warmer, lighter colors and awash in at least three light sources,
     he says.

<p>     At Ambrosia, designers use this lightness as a backdrop for
     accesories and fabrics that add color and texture throughout the
     home.

<p>     As in the single-family home market, active adult homes are
     becoming more themed.

<h>     Not Every Buyer Wants to Vacation at Home  But Most Do

<p>     Since this is their dream home, says Newell, most of these buyers
     want it to have the relaxed feel of a vacation retreat.

<p>     Ambrosia often incorporates the design and color palates associated
     with plantation, seaside cottage or Tommy Bahamas interiors to
     satisfy this desire.

<p>     Of course, we still design models that include traditional, classic
     and more eclectic interiors, but the vacation feel is very hot
     right now," Newell says. We dont want to get so caught up (in
     what's hot) that we don't reach the buyer who desires a home with
     the builders more standard amenities.

<p>     For the active adult buyers who would rather spend their money on
     an actual vacation than a vacation-feel home, "we work with the
     builder to show everything he includes as standard, adding special
     touches to make the home just as enticing, Newell says.

<p>     Whether merchandising to include the ultimate in what the active
     adult buyer desires or what they can realistically afford,
     understanding that the active adult is an individual who continues
     to participate in the excitement and rigors of everyday life is
     essential.
