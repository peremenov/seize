<h> A Language
Policy for Wales

<h>   by Roger Warren Evans, Fabian, Gower CLP

<p>   "The language issue" has long figured prominently in the politics of
   Wales.  The issue is conventionally conceived in terms of the
   assertion of Welsh usage "against" English usage. Use of the Welsh
   language has become one of the hallmarks of Welsh nationalism, of the
   assertion of a Welsh, Celtic cultural identity to contrast with the
   conventions of an Anglo-Saxon "English" culture. It is true that the
   history of Wales has been scarred by the oppression of the Welsh
   language, and of Welsh speakers, by dominant English speakers.
   Similar linguistic polarities have scarred other European societies,
   in Belgium, Brittany, and the Basque provinces. Against that
   background, it is understandable that those opposing rule from London
   should have rallied around the traditional language of Wales. It is no
   accident that one of the most radical Welsh political groups should
   have been called Cymdeithas Yr Iaith, or The Welsh Language Society.

<p>   A future language policy for Wales should, however, be conceived in
   much broader terms: it should not be constrained by the narrow
   conflicts of Welsh and English speakers.  Indeed, there is a parallel
   need for a UK-wide language policy to govern the use of multiple
   languages by the modern State and its agencies.  As a modern
   multicultural society, the need is to adapt to the requirements of
   multilingualism, and move away from the conventions of a monoglot, or
   even bi-lingual, society. In a modern society like Wales, the need is
   for a new systematic treatment of the overall process of communication
   by language.

<p>   Language policy has two quite distinct dimensions, namely the personal
   and the communal.

<h>   I   PERSONAL

<p>   The first principle, already formulated at UK law for the purposes of
   criminal court proceedings, is that any person, when faced with the
   prospect of condemnation and punishment, is entitled to be heard and
   to make his defence in his mother tongue.  It is for the Court, as
   part of the conduct of a fair trial, to ensure that satisfactory
   translation/interpretation facilities are available for that
   purpose.

<p>   That principle should be developed, as the primary arm of any language
   policy, for it constitutes a universal human right, going far beyond
   rules regulating the use of Welsh or similar traditional languages. It
   applies with equal force to the foreign visitor accused of shoplifting
   in London's Oxford Street.  Wherever any person is engaged with the
   modern State, for the purpose of either securing a benefit or avoiding
   a penalty, the mother-tongue principle should be assiduously upheld.

<p>   This "mother-tongue" principle is already well established, as a
   matter of Common Law and Court practice.  It should be explicitly
   extended, however, to all situations in which the individualeither
   faces potential adverse consequences (e.g. including Customs or
   immigration investigations) or stands to gain or lose a valuable
   public benefit, according to the outcome of the proceedings.

<h>   II  COMMUNAL 

<p>   The second group of principles is communal, or collective, in
   character.  For each society, the functional need is for a three-way
   classification of languages, as deployed by the State within the
   boundaries of its territory.
   
<l>     * First: Every State needs, as a prerequisite of a settled civic
       order, an official language.  This is the official language of
       State, the language of official pronouncements, the language of
       statutory legislation, the language of official public
       announcements and orders, of the creation of new obligations and
       punishments and benefits. Experience suggests that there should
       preferably be a single official language.  Where states have two
       or more official languages (Ireland, Canada) it is easy for
       differences of interpretation to generate unnecessary
       complication, if not conflict. Under the Government of Wales Act,
       it was initially intended to constitute both English and Welsh as
       having joint official language status, but that plan was abandoned
       at an early stage.

<l>     * Second: Social convention and history may support the
       identification of a traditional language, a language of culture,
       learning and social intercourse, which may be habitually spoken by
       a large number of citizens but which is not the official
       language.  Welsh is a good example of such a traditional language,
       as is Gaelic in Ireland, and Breton in Brittany.  In this respect,
       a single State may accommodate within its borders a range of
       different languages, at provincial or regional level and it should
       be possible to accommodate such differentiation within a
       provincial frame (Catalan in Catalunya, Breton in Brittany,
       Cornish in Cornwall).

<l>     * Third: All societies must now, given the increased ethic and
       cultural diversity within each society, deploy a range of communal
       languages, being languages other than the indigenous traditional
       language, but which are spoken by significant numbers of migrants
       within their own communities, and which may still be the
       mother-tongue of newly-arrived migrants or elderly residents who
       have never been able to learn English satisfactorily.

<p>   Each State should spell out, by law, the scope of these different
   categories of language, and their administrative and political
   implications.  In the UK, the need is for primary legislation,
   preferably without imitation to Wales.  This essay sets out the
   principles upon which such legislation should be prepared.

<h>   Official Language

<p>   The UK should designate a single official language, binding upon all
   its territories.  All official statements and requirements,
   instructions given, benefits conferred should as a matter of
   constitutional law be required to be stated in the official language,
   and clearly expressed. This principle has been developed as a matter
   of Common Law, and is embodied in the principles of construction
   ("interpretation") applied by the Courts in deciding the meaning of
   statutes and statutory instruments (i.e. primary and secondary
   legislation). And in this sense, whether with express statutory
   provision or not, the official language of Wales is English.

<p>   This principle extends to public requirements issued under
   legislation, made by any arm of government, national, provincial or
   local: in a highly mobile society, the most common of these takes the
   form of highway signage, but the principle also applies to the conduct
   of all legal proceedings, both criminal and civil.  A further vital
   feature of contemporary society is the informational leaflet,
   particularly in the welfare sector, and this may shade into binding or
   procedural or advisory administrative directives, affecting a
   citizen's position.  All such "official" statements should be made in
   the official Language. The same should hold true of official public
   records of public proceedings, including parliamentary and Civil
   Service records; where any statement was made, in such proceedings, in
   any language other than the Official Language, the record should
   always carry an official translation.  And in all cases, the official
   language alone should generate legal effect.

<h>   Traditional Language

<p>   For most parts of the UK, there is no language capable of contending
   for designation as a traditional language, other than English itself.
   But in Wales, the Welsh language is the traditional language,
   occupying a very distinctive position, historically, culturally and
   politically.  This status has already been recognised by the Welsh
   language legislation, the provision of S4C television, and the work of
   the Welsh Language Board.  Indeed, in some respects, this legislation
   has already conferred on the Welsh language greater currency than a
   traditional language should necessarily, as a matter of general
   principle, enjoy.

<p>   But the concept of a traditional language should be developed further,
   by way of new statutory entitlement.
   
<l>     * Place names should be designated in either the official or the
       traditional language, but no other.  Every place should be
       accorded one name and one name only, whichever the language of
       choice. The choice of language should be a matter for decision by
       the most relevant local authority: Cardiff City Council should
       decide on the naming of Cardiff (either Cardiff or Caerdydd, but
       not both).  For Dinas Powis, the relevant Authority would be the
       Dinas Powis Community Council.
<l>     * Public facilities could, at the discretion of the relevant
       authority, also be designated in either language - cemetery or
       mynwent, school or ysgol, church or eglwys, museum or amgueddfa.
<l>     * Public Documents: In the case of specific public documents
       (whether bearing coercive force or merely advisory) the State
       should always, if properly requested by a citizen to do so, make
       them available in the traditional language, as well as the
       official language.  There should be no requirement that all public
       documentation should be made available in the traditional language
       (unless of course the mother-tongue principle were engaged).  And
       the State should have the residual power to determine a request to
       be vexatious or otherwise without proper foundation.
<l>     * Active support should be given by the State for the cultivation of
       the traditional language, both within the educational system and
       otherwise. In Wales, education authorities should make many more
       facilities available for residents seeking to learn Welsh.

<p>   The relevant authority should always retain a jurisdiction to avoid
   dual-language deployment where other overriding considerations apply.
   For example, it is a dangerous and destructive feature of Welsh
   highway signage that operational instructions are conveyed in both
   English and Welsh, thus running the risk of confused perceptions in an
   environment where highway safety should be the prime concern.

<h>   Communal Languages

<p>   The status of communal languages will increase in importance, as the
   incidence of international migration increases, and new ethnic and
   cultural groupings become established within the territory of each
   State.  Procedures should be put in place for the official designation
   of a language, within any territorial unit of governance, as a
   communal language.

<p>   For those speaking minority foreign languages, the two most important
   factors are bound to be (a) learning the official language, and (b)
   benefitting from the mother-tongue principle.  But if a community
   became firmly established within any locality (which is the common
   experience of migrating groups) their settlement should be recognised
   in other ways.  For example, cultural grant facilities should be
   accessible for the cultivation of communal languages and cultures, and
   individuals should have the right to call for public advisory
   documentation to be made available in the communal language (e.g. as
   many educational authorities provide foreign-language translations of
   material relevant to children's education).

<p>   The Welsh Assembly is well suited to the development of a new
   statutory framework, pointing the way ahead, internationally, for this
   dimension of UK public life.  Within the UK, it is only in Wales that
   the relevance of these issues is widely perceived and understood.
   There should be no question of any crude stand-off between the
   protagonists of English and the devotees of Welsh.  The issue is a
   much more profound one, going to the dignity and human rights of each
   individual within modern society.

<p>   Wales should take the international lead, with the promotion of a new
   UK Language Act, embodying the above principles.

<h>   A Language Policy for Wales 

<h>   Response to Roger Warren Evans by Fabian Chris Castle
<h>   Cji-castle@cymru.new.labour.org.uk

<p>   RWE has offered us a reasonable attempt to reconcile Welsh people's commonly-held assumptions,
   misapprehensions, prejudices and ignorance with his obvious goodwill
   towards non-English languages. However, assumptions misapprehensions,
   prejudices and ignorance are features of his essay.

<p>   I will argue that these negative attitudes lead to a confusion of
   language and ethnicity. A confusion, which is the most disgraceful
   aspect of the "language issue".

<p>   However, I wish to begin with two more obvious examples of linguistic
   prejudice.

<l>   (1) In an otherwise liberal-minded article on languages and their
   value (You are what you speak New Scientist 30 November 02) a subtle
   "pro-English" linguistic chauvinism became evident. The linguist
   Slobin has done research into the way that a group of languages
   (including English) have "colourful" verbs which express movement in
   terms that are "dynamic, full of energy". Other languages (including
   Romance languages) are described has having "prosaic verbs" and
   "lacking colourful verbs". All these terms are value laden. Would it
   not be better to consider why English/Russian etc are so "subjective"
   in comparisons with "objective" Romance languages? Are French/Spanish
   etc really "lacking"?In this context I ask readers to note RWE's use
   of the words "devotee", "protagonists", "unnecessary complication",
   and "[the] dangerous and destructive [bilingual] highway signage."

<l>   (2) My second example is Paul Starling's Welsh Mirror. Readers of
   Planet magazine will be aware of Patrick McGuiness's close readings of
   the Daily Mirror's Welsh edition. Patrick has shown that by carefully
   selective translation and omission the Mirror is conflating all Welsh
   Language activists and Welsh speakers with the most violent forms of
   nationalism, xenophobia, and nazi-ism. The Mirror is careful to
   separate "decent Welsh-speakers" from this, but in Mirror terms these
   can only be those who are prepared to stay silent in the face of
   linguistic bigotry from any English speakers with negative attitudes
   towards Welsh. The true horror is that Labour HQ at Transport House
   Cardiff, and some Labour representatives, are implicated in this black
   propaganda.

<h>    Dimensions of Language Policy, as proposed by RWE, whichneed to be
reconsidered

<h>   "Personal rights"

<p>   The "mother-tongue principle" could lead to unintentional but
   institutional racism. "Mother tongue" denotes ones language of ethnic
   origin. Many Sikhs may have Punjabi as their mother-tongue, yet
   English may be their language of choice, they may be more comfortable
   speaking English away from the home. Using their mother-tongue in
   dealings with the State, however, may be an important way for them to
   express their ethnic identity. A right to use Punjabi in relations
   with the State, if it is provided for one group, must be available for
   all who speak Punjabi - including Sikh converts who may be non-Aryan.
   Punjabi in this case becomes a communal language, not an ethnic
   language. A close reading of RWE's essay will reveal that "ethnic
   language" is a better description what he outlines.

<p>   English is my mother tongue, but Welsh is my chosen communal language
   in dealings with the State (form filling, advice lines etc). This, for
   me, is an important signifier that I have reinstated the "Cymreictod"
   (Welshness) of my father's family who were bullied and cajoled into
   raising their children as monoglot English speakers.

<p>   Welsh is likely to be my language of choice in Court if I ever feel it
   necessary to engage in civil disobedience. Speaking Welsh is a major
   component of my sense of identity but the language does not define my
   ethnicity in any way shape or form. I have argued long and hard in the
   welsh language media against arguments for "Cymreictod Ethnig" (Ethnic
   Welshness).
   
<h>   "Communal/Collective rights" >

<p>   Whilst RWE's assertion, that two official and equal languages can cause problems in interpretation of
   legal documents, is correct, that is not sufficient to argue against
   making Welsh an Official Language. I fail to see any logical reason or
   even argument against the creation of a subordinate Official
   Languagestatus for Welsh.English then would become theprimary Official
   Language, and it alone would generate legal effect. I also see no
   reason why other languages with a British or any other origin could
   not one day become subordinate Official Languages within British
   towns, counties or regions.

<p>   Turning to road safety, if problems exist due to linguistic problems
   with road signs, we need to seriously consider confiscating the cars
   and lorries of non-English-speaking drivers the second they reach
   Dover. I accept that there is a problem with the design of bilingual
   road signage - the confusion is usually caused by alternating monoglot
   English and Welsh signage, or by changing the relative position of the
   two languages, sometimes with Welsh on top, sometimes English. But the
   only way to "promote" Welsh is to make it visible, and accepted as
   normal. Bilingual road signs and official documents are amongst the
   best ways to do this. RWE's idea of a "traditional language" seems
   designed to make Welsh disappear from any areas that are not
   ethnically Welsh-speaking i.e. where the majority are Welsh-speakers
   born and bred.

<p>   More Welsh Assembly work must first be carried out in Welsh. More work
   must be done to assimilate non-Welsh speakers into their naturally
   Welsh-speaking communities. Most importantly, we must tackle the
   economic and social problems which are "linguistically cleansing" the
   traditional heartlands of the Welsh language. These processes exist in
   many parts of Britain. Language difference however makes the effect
   more obvious in Welsh-speaking areas.

<p>   As a party, Labour must take a long, hard look at the provision of
   Social Housing. We must find ways of funding real council housing and
   consider modifying the right to buy. We must be prepared to
   acknowledge that in some cases property rights militate against the
   welfare of stable communities.

<p>   Language shift in Wales is an indicator of social processes which
   Labour is failing even to acknowledge - let alone deal with. We are
   not, at present, protecting working-class young people throughout
   Britain - from Cornwall to Bournmouth to Oxford to Abersoch -
   anywhere, in fact, where the right to buy a pretty view, an executive
   development or a luxury apartment is more important than the welfare
   of a community.
