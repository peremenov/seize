<h>   Pelvic floor exercises: a new solution for impotence? [s.gif]

<h>   Written by Rael Martell
   
<p>   Pelvic floor exercises have long been considered a useful way for
   women to restore their muscle tone after giving birth, but increasing
   evidence is emerging that men can also benefit. 

<p>   Recent research suggests that pelvic floor exercises are highly
   effective in helping men who have problems developing and sustaining
   an erection.
   
<p>   A study from the University of West of England, Bristol, suggests that
   the exercises can help both men with erectile dysfunction (impotence)
   and premature ejaculation, and also those who experience 'dribbling'
   after urinating.
   
<p>   On top of this, experts believe the exercises can also help improve
   the quality of orgasm - the UK-based Impotence Association says the
   workout may 'increase awareness of sexual sensations and enhance
   enjoyment'.
   
<h>   The big squeeze
   
<p>   The exercises target the pelvic floor, which supports the bladder and
   the bowel and is made up of layers of muscle that stretch from the
   tailbone at the back to the pubic bone in front.
   
<p>   Also known as Kegel exercises, named after the South Californian
   gynaecologist Dr Arnold Kegel, the regime involves squeezing the
   hammock of muscles in the abdominal region.
   
<p>   According to the Impotence Association, the exercises strengthen the
   muscles around the penis, improve the blood supply in the pelvis and
   thus 'enhance orgasmic sensations by strengthening the pelvic muscles
   that produce ejaculation by their contraction'.
   
<p>   Although the exercises have to be learned (possibly over a matter of
   days), with practice they can be carried out while watching TV or
   doing the washing up.
   
<h>   How to find the pelvic floor muscles

<p>   To find your pelvic floor muscles, you should sit or lie comfortably
   with the muscles of your thighs, bottom and stomach relaxed.
   
<h>   Muscles around the anus
<p>       You should then tighten the ring of muscle around your anus
       without squeezing your bottom, according to government advice from
       the Australian Department of Health and Ageing.

<h>   Muscles around the urethra
<p>       To feel these muscles, try to stop your flow of urine mid-stream,
       and then restart it.
	   
<p>       You should only do this to find which muscles to use, or to check
       your progress. Don't practice this more than once a week, or it
       could affect your ability to pass urine.

<h>   Pelvic floor exercises
   
<p>   The Australian Department of Health and Ageing says that once you can
   feel your pelvic floor muscles working, you can attempt to exercise
   them.
   
<l>   Tighten and draw in the muscles around the anus and urethra, lifting
   the muscles up inside.
   
<l>   Count to five, then release and relax. The Department says you should
   have a 'definite feeling of letting go'.
   
<l>   Their guidelines recommend men repeat this up to maximum of 8 to 10
   squeezes, resting for 10 seconds after each tightening of the muscles.
   
<l>   You should follow this by 5 to 10 short, strong squeezes in quick
   succession.
   
<l>   Repeat the slow and quick squeezes around four to five times a day.

<h>   An alternative to drugs?
   
<p>   The benefits of such exercises cannot be endorsed enough by Dr Grace
   Dorey, a specialist continence physiotherapist at Taunton's Somerset
   Nuffield Hospital and North Devon District Hospital, and a visiting
   research fellow at the University of West England, Bristol.
   
<p>   Dr Dorey undertook a survey of 55 men with an average age of 59 who
   had experienced erectile dysfunction for six months or more.Of the men
   taking part in the exercises:
   
<l>     * 40 per cent regained normal erectile function.
<l>     * 35.5 per cent improved
<l>     * 25.5 per cent showed no difference.

<p>   Perhaps the most dramatic of Dr Dorey's findings was the improvement
   resulting from pelvic floor exercises compared to the use of Viagra -
   the results were the same.
   
<h>   Raising awareness
   
<p>   Dr Dorey feels passionately about the use of pelvic floor exercises
   for men suffering erectile dysfunction, arguing that it has been a
   neglected area for the past 50 years.
   
<p>   'Historically, women have been advised to perform pelvic floor
   exercises especially before and after childbirth, hysterectomy and the
   menopause. This research shows that it is equally important for men to
   maintain the muscle tone and function of their pelvic floors.'
   
<p>   And speaking of her own research, she explains: 'The results show
   clearly that pelvic floor exercises can be highly beneficial for those
   men with the motivation and determination to perform them.
   
<p>   'Now I am intending to raise awareness of the availability of an
   effective alternative to drug therapy for men experiencing erectile
   dysfunction.'
   
<p>   If Dr Dorey has her way, pelvic floor exercises will in the future
   form part of every young male's sex education. 'I firmly believe that
   lads from the age of adolescence should be taught the benefits of
   pelvic floor exercises as a preventative measure.'
