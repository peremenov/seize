<h>   The luxury of doubt

<h>   by Laurie Taylor Sep 01, 03

<p>   Satirist, moralist, literary provocateur Will Self
   lectures Laurie Taylor on addiction, debauchery, banality and the
   search for serious thought
   
<p>   Q Id like to start with one of your specialist subjects addiction.Youve
   written about yourself as an addictive personality and about how youve
   beaten your various addictions. I was wondering if I could fall back
   on that personality description myself. Im currently having terrible
   trouble kicking the smoking habit.
   
<p>   A Im sorry, but I think that smoking may be special. There is a
   strange confluence in smoking between social acceptability and the
   physiological addictiveness of the nicotine itself. Thats why I think
   there may be a difference in kind between addiction to nicotine and
   those other forms of addiction where individual psychopathology plays
   a much greater role. So you find people possibly yourself who really
   have an addiction issue with nicotine but not with any other
   substances. There are other people and I am definitely one who
   manifest the full blown addictive psychopathology.
   
<p>   Q Is that an inbuilt personality trait a genetic attribute?

<p>   A Its not easy to be precise about the genetic or individualhistorical
   or cultural components in that psychopathology. In a way it doesnt
   matter. You can spend an awful lot of time as an addict, an awful lot
   of useless time, debating such stuff. My view of addiction is that
   once you have acknowledged it, once you have seen it within yourself,
   then such debates become otiose. They actually may obscure the issue
   of how one recovers from it.
   
<p>   Q You talk about recovering from addiction. Does that recovery have to
   take the form of complete abstinence? No cocaine at all. No heroin at
   all. No drink at all. Isnt that attributing too much power to the
   substance?
   
<p>   A When you have been wellknown and typified as a heavy user of
   intoxicants, as I have, and you stop completely, a lot of people who
   know you socially say, Was it really that bad? Did you really need to
   go that far, to that extreme? And you can understand that reaction.
   Because of course the social use of intoxication is endemic in our
   society and in many instances it is a highly constructive form of
   social bonding, a type of social cement, and even a source of
   inspiration. All you can say in reply to such people is that You
   werent actually there. You didnt see what the reality of my
   relationship with intoxication was like. And you couldnt see it
   because by definition it was something that only occurred in private
   or with other people who also had an addictive psychopathology.
   
<p>   Q I can understand what youre saying about the need to stop completely
   when were talking about hard drugs. But Im rather with your
   questioners when they ask why you needed to stop drinking as well. Ive
   never considered such a big step. It would change my life too much. I
   mean I wouldnt have half the friends Ive got now if I hadnt got drunk
   with them in the first place. Thats how I got to like them.
   
<p>   A But by the same token, you arent going to like people who you
   wouldnt know you liked sober, if you dont stop drinking. And while the
   world of intoxication is pretty large, its actually not as large as
   the world of nonintoxication. It just seems that way from within it.
   Its like a Saul Steinberg cartoon of a New York drinkers view of the
   world. Manhattan and the giant skyscrapers are entirely made up of
   bottles and optics and so forth, and the plains of sobriety are tiny.
   
<p>   Q Is there a moral dimension to this? Did you come to dislike yourself
   as an addict?
   
<p>   A Yes, very much so. I didnt like what I had become in moral terms. I
   actually found I was doing things that were against my moral will, not
   just occasionally, but a lot of the time, on a daily basis. I had the
   distinct sensation that I was a puppet of an addictive manipulator,
   that there was a kind of sinister hand which was forcing me in
   directions that I didnt like.
   
<p>   Q A Fat Controller?

<p>   A Yes

<p>   Q And the directions in which you were being forced came to seem
   increasingly mindless, silly, even sordid?
   
<p>   A All of the above. I was ceasing to function as a parent, as a
   partner, and certainly as a constructive person in wider society. I
   never missed an opportunity to put someone else down or to make a
   snide or cynical remark and I displayed a closed rather than an open
   mind. Somebody who has helped me a lot in recovery from my addictive
   illness said to me very early on allow yourself the luxury of doubt.
   No closed minds. I found that a very, very interesting statement. It
   was interesting because it was recasting the idea of being an
   agnostic. Agnosticism is very very seldom correctly treated as a form
   of conviction in itself. But that phrase, the luxury of doubt points
   to the idea that clinging fast to doubt is an extremely viable form of
   conviction.
   
<p>   Q Of course, there must always be the slight background worry that
   drugs had something to do with your literary inspiration.
   
<p>   A There is ample ammunition to stoke up that particular funeral pyre
   but even in the course of my heaviest drink and drug using, I knew
   that wasnt the case. I was extremely well versed in the history of
   intoxication in relation to creativity. I was always very fond of
   quoting De Quincys line: if a man who keeps oxen should take opium he
   will dream of oxen.
   
<p>   Q Your indulgences may not have prompted your creativity but they
   certainly gave you good material. I was reading your book Dorian
   recently and was relishing your capacity to create an atmosphere of
   decadence.
   
<p>   A Well, you have got to have been there. I did a reading at the Soho
   theatre when Dorian first came out. And after the show this woman came
   out and said to me, I very much enjoyed your reading Id read the whole
   of the first chapter But I found your characters absolutely
   incredible. I cant believe that people like that exist. And I actually
   lost my temper, which I dont do very often with members of my reading
   public. I said: Just how many repressed homosexual upperclass drug
   addicts were you hanging out with in the early 1980s? Well, actually,
   none, she said. And I said, WELL, I WAS. So you know, I really know
   what that milieu was like, I was there. It really comes back again to
   the oxen quote. The reason why I have written so much about decadence
   and drugs is because that is the way I have lived. Its where Ive lived
   a lot of my adult life. But I like to think that if I had run a donkey
   sanctuary in Cornwall then I would have written well about that.
   
<p>   Q Its probably because of your addictive notoriety that we dont hear
   too much about any other parts of your life. I was interested, for
   example, to discover that your father was Peter Self, a wellknown and
   highly respected academic
   
<p>   A He was a political scientist, Professor of Public Administration at
   the LSE and he ended up as Emeritus Professor at the Australian
   National University. He died in 1999. He emigrated when I was at
   Oxford at the end of the 70s so I didnt see a great deal of him in the
   last 20 years of his life. I had a very tricky relationship with him.
   It has improved dramatically since he died. For various reasons. One
   of which is that I am able to talk to him in a way that I couldnt do
   when he was alive. He doesnt answer back. And if he does I can script
   his replies. The other thing he was a relatively old parent. He was in
   his midforties when I was born. So its only now that Ive reached the
   same age that he was when I was a baby. And that allows me to feel a
   profound physical sympathy with him in a way that I havent before.
   Thats because of the way ones inheritance appears in mannerisms. I
   find myself involuntarily caught within the tiny ephemeral prison of
   his cough, or his sneeze, or his yawn. You get to know your same sex
   parent at that physiological level.
   
<p>   Q How much did his opinions influence you?

<p>   A What I have never denied about Peter, about my father, is that he
   had some excellent attributes although he came from a kind of odd
   uppermiddle class background, public school, Oxford. When I was in my
   early teens, rather like some strange kind of JB Priestley inspired
   peregrination, our divorced fatherandson contact time was spent doing
   these walks around England, walking the Pennine Way, walking the
   Cornish coast... and talking. Talking endlessly, endlessly talking
   about philosophy and politics, and stopping in pubs where my father
   was always unable to understand the licensing laws so that he was
   always plying me with forbidden drink. I once got thrown out of a pub
   in Padstow because he bought me a double brandy. I was 12 at the time.
   The landlord was absolutely furious. Peter couldnt understand why.
   
<p>   Q What were his politics?

<p>   A He was Labour with utopian leanings. A Footite to some extent. In
   the 70s he was very angry with the Labour Partys failure to adequately
   negotiate a role for industrial democracy within the emerging economy.
   And he was learned and perspicacious enough to see that the rigidity
   which the old Labour party embraced would entail its own reaction. He
   was not, therefore, surprised by Thatcherism. He saw where we were
   going. The last book he wrote was called Rolling Back the Market. It
   was an attack on the new free market libertarianism.
   
<p>   Q Do you share his political views?

<p>   A Dad and I were in agreement on most things up until he died. But
   where I think he had the edge on me, as an academic and as someone who
   had been an adviser to ministers here and in Australia, as somebody
   who sat on government commissions he was more committed and he worked
   harder. It is very easy for us in the fourth estate and in the media
   to attitudinise because we have always got the escape hatch of saying,
   well it is not our job to prescribe.
   
<p>   Q You say that your father predicted something like Thatcherism. I
   think perhaps that you might be given some credit on the left for
   having foreseen what New Labour under Blair would be like in power.
   You were condemning his political style and content long before he was
   elected.
   
<p>   A Thats right. I bow to no man or woman in my Blair hatred. I did one
   of the Independents Heroes and Villains columns on Blair shortly after
   he got the Labour party leadership. So yes, early on. I always thought
   he was vapid, sanctimonious. He represented politics as an absence
   rather than a presence.
   
<p>   Q When you talk and write in this way about Blair and New Labour in
   your various journalistic roles, do you see yourself as in the
   conversion business. Do you want people to change their minds and
   agree with you?
   
<p>   A No, I dont. Broadly, I think I can be described as a satirist as
   much as anything else. And I think traditionally satire had a covert
   agenda of moral reform. If the audience for satire knows you are
   really convinced of the underlying truth then it becomes merely a form
   of pontificating. They must have a residue of doubt about where it is
   you are really coming from. But in the past that kind of satire,
   satire like that of Swift, operated within a matrix of JudeoChristian
   moral precepts. We dont have those any more. So, the new problem that
   satirists have to face is moral relativism. And in that context, it
   seems to me that the role of satire that I produce is to make the
   audience think for themselves. It is to throw the whole burden of
   moral thought back on to the audience. So I am not trying to convert
   people to anything but thinking seriously. Im trying to be a
   provocateur.
   
<p>   Q What about your religious attitudes? Was religion around you in your
   childhood?
   
<p>   A It was around in a profoundly English way. My grandmothers family
   were clergymen. They were Anglican pastors. And the Bishop of
   Chichester was a greatgreat grandfather of mine and my grandfather was
   Chairman of the Lay Association of the Church of England.
   
<p>   Q So it was more or less taken for granted that to be C of E was the
   normal state of affairs?
   
<p>   A More or less, but it was a very broad church. Youre a Devil
   worshipper? Jolly good. Do come along to the vicarage on Sunday
   morning. That kind of thing. But of course my mother was Jewish, but
   Jewish in denial partly because of coming to England in the late 50s
   and being married to a gentile and partly because of her own
   psychological makeup. Jewishness was something that was only partly
   acknowledged in our family. It was either oddly embraced or oddly
   rejected so much so, for example, that my brother doesnt even think of
   himself as being that Jewish, whereas I do tend to. Maybe its all
   because of family politics.
   
<p>   Q Where are you now? Does anything in that Anglican or Jewish
   background still speak to you. Is religion real to you? Is it
   significant? Or can I put you down as a straightforward nonbeliever?
   
<p>   A I have to go back to agnosticism, to the luxury of doubt. If I allow
   myself the luxury of doubt in this area I am wholly conflicted. All my
   study of religion leads me to believe that there is a hell of a lot
   more to religious belief than the notion that it is simply an opiate.
   There is a hell of a lot more to religious experience than that.
   
<p>   Q You seem to be echoing William Jamess view of religious experience
   as special, as distinctive.
   
<p>   A Yes, yes. Thats right. I do believe that it is different. Actually
   that book by William James, Varieties of Religious Experience, had a
   big impact on me for just that reason. It is a fantastic book and
   mandatory reading for anyone who wants to deal with that stuff
   seriously.
   
<p>   Q But does this mean that you want to say that our capacity to have
   religious experiences means that there is some external power from
   which such experiences spring?
   
<p>   A I dont mean a personified god. Im far too influenced by Nietzsche
   for that. I find it impossible not to see that sort of god as the
   shadow play of the ego itself. I love that line from Schopenhauer
   about Kant: Kant is like a man who flirts and dances all evening at a
   masked ball only to find that when the lady takes the mask off, it is
   his wife. But I do have the view that a godless existence, an atheist
   existence, an existence which excludes the possibility of God, which
   doesnt allow the luxury of doubt, does usher in all sorts of spiritual
   malaise. I really feel that a lot of contemporary society is venal and
   prostituted, debauched on pornography, and subject to a banalisation
   of feeling, and what J.G. Ballard has called the death of affect. I
   really find all that abhorrent and amoral. What my recovery programme
   forced upon me was the need to seriously consider the existence of
   some kind of higher power and its imminence in the world, some sort of
   transcendence. It asked me to seriously consider the limitations of
   ego, the old Socratic formulation that reason is that that knows its
   own limit.
   
<p>   Q I understand that youre writing a book about religion at the moment,
   a book about the manner in which the orthodoxy of fundamentalist
   religions depends upon the existence of a sacred text?
   
<p>   A Yes thats right. What started me off on this were conversations with
   the Muslim fundamentalists who run my local curry house. Around the
   same time I actually went to see the festival of the whirling
   dervishes in Anatolia, in central Turkey. I was reading around Islam
   quite a lot. And there, as with any monistic fundamentalism, you find
   this idea that the text is a book of words for the world that exists
   independently from its own rubric. It abolishes time and stands
   outside of time. It can tell you what to think about everything, about
   genetic engineering and nuclear weapons. Well, the best way to
   satirise and undermine that timeless view of the sacred text would be
   to reveal the wholly contingent and arbitrary nature of a particular
   revolutionary text. That is what I am intending to do in the next
   novel. Basically, it is about a contemporary Londoner who buries a
   kind of rant against modern society in a time capsule for his own
   strange twisted reasons, not for prosperity or anything, but for his
   child, in fact, and it remains buried for 500 years and then becomes
   the sacred book for the future of society. Now that device enables me
   to unlock all of these questions I hope in an absurdist and funny way.

<p>   Q Will, I dont want to make you too self-conscious, but I cant help
   noticing that youve taken a pipe out of your pocket, and that youre
   even now lighting it. Will Self, pipe smoker. A bit like catching Jack
   Kerouac pulling on his slippers. Where did the pipe come from? Let me
   guess. Your father? Another inherited mannerism? Did Peter smoke a
   pipe?
   
<p>   A Of course he did. Absolutely. Ive been smoking it now for about
   seven months. I felt it creeping up on me. Ah, I thought, time for the
   pipe. Thats why I gave up cigarettes altogether for a year because I
   felt the pipe coming on. The tweed jacket comes next.
