<p>        Five minutes. - - Ashley Baltazar spent a total of five minutes at
   the annual Quad Day in August, where hundreds of campus organizations
                    try to sell themselves to students.
					
<p>        Baltazar didn't leave because they weren't doing a good job or
   because she was overwhelmed by the heat. She just doesn't like crowds.
    So there was no chance that you saw her jumping up and down with the
                     Orange Krush on Wednesday night.
					 
<p>          "I don't go to games," she said. "I don't like screaming."

<p>      She believes her crowd phobia has been an issue since around sixth
                                   grade.
								   
<p>      "I think it is because I am overweight," said Baltazar, of Richton
   Park. "I think people are always judging me. I know they are not, but
    I am paranoid about my experiences. It's been ongoing for a while. I
           will always to a level think people are watching me."
		   
<p>       More than three months after Quad Day, she's opened up a bit but
     still shies away from attention. Being a quiet person on a social
     floor can be difficult, but two women are dealing with it on Scott
                                    One.
									
<p>        "I am not looking to be a social butterfly," added Baltazar. "I
     don't think it is something I like doing. I feel more comfortable
                          sitting at my computer."
						  
<p>      She joined the Women in Computer Science club this semester as her
     social outlet on a smaller scale. The club has about 12 members as
    opposed to the larger computer science organization on campus, which
                        boasts hundreds of members.
						
<p>       "It's a nice organization because I know all the people's names,"
            said Baltazar. "I didn't want to be in a big group."
			
<p>         The club combines academic education, featuring speakers from
     Motorola and other companies, with a social aspect such as playing
                   Scrabble at a coffee house on campus.
				   
<p>      Baltazar again busted out of her comfort zone and joined the floor
             for a bowling trip to the Illini Union on Tuesday.
			 
<p>        "I hadn't gone bowling in a few years. I think it is fun," she
    said. "I don't watch bowling competitions, but I think it is pretty
                                   cool."
								   
<p>                      So is she officially an extrovert?

<p>       "I wouldn't say I am less shy," said Baltazar. "I think I am more
                               comfortable."
							   
<p>      For Shannon Smith, the phrase Christmas in July means it's time to
     trim the trees. She owns one-fourth of a Christmas tree business,
            started by her father, and has always been involved.
			
<p>        "We have pictures of me and my brother playing in the trees and
    they are our size. It's fun to watch over time how we grew with the
    trees," said Smith, of Woodstock. "It's a huge part of my life and I
                        have a lot of fun doing it."
						
<p>        She carried a little bit of the family business into Scott One.

<p>       "I definitely brought back a Christmas tree and I am not sure if
                  that is allowed in the dorm," she said.
				  
<p>      She becomes bubbly and excited when talking about her passion, but
    she's a self-described shy person. A quiet farm girl, whose favorite
     musician isn't the Dixie Chicks but a hard-core rapper named DMX.
	 
<p>       Smith is very comfortable in her shyness. She prefers reading to
   going out. Her roommate Leslie Selcke took her to a party early in the
          school year. Smith stayed for 10 minutes before leaving.
		  
<p>        "One of my teachers told me that when I got to college, it was
    going to be an open-your-eyes experience and that all the people who
   were goody-two-shoes in high school would go insane," she said. "I am
   pretty much the same. I don't party that much. A party consists of me
                  and my roommate watching Disney movies."
				  
<p>                       Smith enjoys quiet environments.
					   
<p>      "I like to go to different libraries and test them out," she said.
                          "I am a nerd like that."
						  
<p>      Smith wakes up between 5 and 6 a.m. for her morning cardio workout
   in the basement of Scott Hall. In order to get good sleep, she goes to
        bed around 11 p.m. Few people on Scott One sleep that early.
		
<p>       Residents organize a movie night every Wednesday at 11 p.m., held
   in the women's floor study lounge. And while it's an excellent bonding
     activity, it also leads to knocking on the women's breezeway doors
     from Scott One guys late at night, which can make it difficult for
                   people to fall asleep before midnight.
				   
<p>              "Sometimes our floor is kind of noisy," said Smith.
			  
<p>       Resident Adviser Doug Bach said Smith and Baltazar are easygoing
    and have nice personalities, which some people might not see due to
                         their soft-spoken nature.
						 
<p>       "Both of them are a little more reserved and quieter than most of
        the girls on the floor. I haven't seen too much of them this
   semester," said Bach, of Wheaton. "I do encourage them to participate
    in the programs. I would like them to feel like they are part of the
                                  floor."
								  
<p>      As a project early in the year, Bach learned some interesting facts
   about each of his residents. He said Baltazar enjoys online comics and
    Smith is a huge Nicolas Cage fan. The latter information is evident
    after walking into Smith's room, where a cornucopia of Cage pictures
                            wallpaper her room.
							
<p>      Those pictures and her belongings may not be part of Scott One for
   too much longer. Smith e-mailed Bach a week before Thanksgiving break
    requesting a floor transfer next semester because the floor was too
                                   loud.
								   
<p>        "I took that personally because it is my job to make sure that
   everyone has what they need on the floor," said Bach. "It's important
     that everyone on the floor is able to get work done and get their
       sleep. I kind of feel like I am not fulfilling my obligations
                                completely."
