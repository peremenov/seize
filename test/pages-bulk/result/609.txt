<p>   Health Secretary John Reid has given the go ahead for 15 new NHS hospital
developments worth more than £4 billion.

<p>   The announcement will bring investment in new NHS hospitals to more
   than Â£16 billion since 1997. The NHS is already well on course to meet
   the NHS Plan target of 100 new hospital schemes open to patients by
   2010. More than 40 are already built and operational.

<p>   These new hospital developments announced today will be funded largely
   through the Private Finance Initiative (PFI). It will now be for local
   health organisations to progress these schemes to the next stages of
   development.

<p>   The new developments include plans for:

<l>     * New mental health facilities for Leicestershire, Merseyside, and
       Teesside
<l>     * A new cardiac research institute and upgraded cardiac wing for
       Great Ormond Street Hospital
<l>     * Modern new buildings for Papworth Hospital's world class
       cardiothoracic services

<p>   John Reid said:

<p>   "The NHS is in the middle of the biggest hospital building programme
   in its history. After years of under-investment, the infrastructure of
   the NHS is at last being modernised and made fit for the 21st Century.

<p>   "The new hospital plans given the green light today represent the type
   of bright, modern, clean environments that all NHS patients should
   experience during their treatment. I look forward to seeing further
   progress on these schemes, and all of the other hospital building
   projects that are underway, and particularly to seeing the benefits
   they will bring to their local communities.

<p>   "I am delighted to receive such good quality proposals and I will be
   encouraging local health organisations to progress these rapidly
   through the next important stages of their development."

<p>   The 15 new hospital developments are:

<l>     * Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire (£880m) - A major acute service
       reconfiguration in the Hertfordshire area, including plans for
       redevelopment and expansion at Watford and a new hospital at
       Hatfield, incorporating a new cancer centre for Bedfordshire &
       Hertfordshire.
<l>     * North Bristol and South Gloucestershire (£310m) - Options include
       the relocation of specialist acute services onto a single site in
       North Bristol / South Gloucestershire, complemented by a network

<l>     * Papworth Hospital NHS Trust (£148m) - World class cardiothoracic
       services in new state-of-the-art buildings for Papworth Hospital.
       Options include redeveloping the existing Papworth site or
       co-locating with Addenbrookes on the "Cambridge Biomedical
       Campus."

<l>     * Hillingdon Hospital redevelopment (£271m) - Redevelopment of the
       Hillingdon Hospital site in Northwest London and the total

       create a new cardiac research institute. This is not a PFI scheme
       - it will be funded with £75m in public capital and the rest

       and Hartlepool NHS Trust sites.

       Southend Hospital site to ensure sufficient capacity is available
       to deliver efficient high dependency, elective and emergency care
       services for the people of South East Essex. The scheme will be
       complemented by the parallel development of satellite and
       community services and an Independent Sector Treatment Centre
       (ISTC) to provide additional capacity for outpatients and simple
       surgical procedures.
<l>     * North Mersey Future Healthcare Project (£1008m) - The North Mersey

       Royal Liverpool University Hospital, an elective care centre and
       additional ward facilities at University Hospital Aintree and the
       further and improved provision of facilities for people with
       mental health problems through a range of community mental health
       resources and the establishment of a local Psychiatry Intensive
       Care Unit by mental health Trust, Mersey Care.
<l>     * South of Tyne and Wearside (£50m) - The scheme will provide mental
       health facilities at Cherry Knowle Hospital in Ryehope,

       hospital.
<l>     * Northwick Park and St Marks (£305m) - The project will redevelop

       600 bed acute hospital, designed around a new service model that
       is based on a series of 'super-teams' that combine both hospital
       and primary care skills with the ability to provide readily
       accessible clinical opinions and diagnoses.
