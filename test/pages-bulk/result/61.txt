<p>   I want to know what graphics cards, ram and processor everyone is
   using and how well fs2004 performs. I currently have:
<l>   512mb ram
<l>   2.8 ghz
<l>   intel extreme graphics card 2

<l>   512 RAM
<l>   2.66 Ghz CPU
<l>   Nvidia 5200
<p>   Its ok for now, FPS gets quite low sometimes, but I'm going to upgrade
   soon anyway. Probably going to get another 512 RAM to have a gig, and
   then a new Radeon 6800 graphics card.

<l>   P4C 2.4 gig running at 2.66 gigs.
<l>   1024 mb PC3200
<l>   GForce Ti 4800 se.
   
<p>   It runs very well, no problems at all.
   It will fly big jets into busy airports day or night with lots of AI
   and keep up well over 20 fps (2X Anti aliasing) which is more that
   adequate for smooth operation.
   
<p>   I would really like a better video card though as this one is a bit
   weak when it comes to ground detail...

<p>   runs smooth but when i added ultimate traffic it kinda slows down with
   ultra high settings around 15 to 20 to 30 fps depends on traffic.
