                   _____________________________________

<p>     By all available evidence, the United States has been the leading
     source of small arms supply to Central America since the 1950s and
     continues to be so today. Although there is little difference to
     people being harassed with such weapons, these arms have flowed to
     Central America both legally--with the approval of the U.S.
     government--and illegally. Under U.S. law (Arms Export Control
     Act), any U.S. national or U.S. registered corporation, or any
     person or corporation residing in the United States, must obtain
     permission from the government to export any munition. Other laws
     (National Security Act, Foreign Assistance Act) give the U.S.
     government the right to transfer weapons on a sale or grant
     basis--overtly or covertly.

<p>     Weapons "made in the USA" have found their way to Central America
     principally in four ways:
	 
<l>     * on-going commercial sales, negotiated by the arms industry or a
       middle man and approved for export by the State and Commerce
       Departments;

<l>     * open (transparent) government-negotiated military aid or sales;

<l>     * clandestine government-supplied arms (usually by the CIA); and

<l>     * illegal purchase and shipment from the United States by private
       actors operating for financial gain.

<p>     This paper briefly describes what is known about Cold War-era,
     recent past, and on-going small arms supply to the region through
     each of these programs.
     
<h>     Commercial Arms Sales

<p>     Historically, and continuing on through today, the vast majority of
     small arms exports from America occur through Direct Commercial
     Sales (DCS), negotiated between U.S. companies or brokers and
     foreign buyers. The foreign customer may be a government entity
     (e.g., interior ministry, justice ministry, ministry of defense, or
     national police), a corporation or person using the weapons for
     private security, or a gun vendor.

<p>     Direct Commercial Sales must be approved by the State Department's
     Office of Defense Trade Controls or the Commerce Department's
     Bureau of Export Administration, depending on the equipment. The
     Commerce Department regulates transfers of 12-gauge shotguns and
     components and shotgun shells, as well as stun guns and shock
     batons. The State Department is responsible for all other gun
     exports, including non-military rifles and pistols.

<p>     Some State Department-licensed sales are subject to Congressional
     notification before export licenses may be granted. For sales over
     $14 million Congress must be given 15-30 days pre-notice. Commerce
     Department-licensed sales are not subject to any prior
     Congressional scrutiny.

<p>     In general, when the customer is a government entity, the choice of
     whether to use the government-to-government channel or to deal
     directly with the arms manufacturer or broker is up to the
     purchaser. Direct sales are quicker, sometimes cheaper and entail
     less oversight than do government-negotiated sales. In addition,
     both the Commerce and State Departments are less transparent about
     the deals they are licensing than the Pentagon is about sales it is
     negotiating. Many foreign customers have viewed this secrecy with
     favor, and therefore prefer to purchase arms directly from
     manufacturers.

<p>     Prior to 1996 it was practically impossible to obtain any
     information about State Department-licensed small arms exports to
     Central America or elsewhere. Beginning in that year, however,
     Congress caused the government to provide an annual highly specific
     report on export license authorizations granted in the preceding
     year. This report is known as the "Section 655 Report"--after the
     provision of law mandating it.

<p>     According to this report, during 1996 and 1997, the U.S. government
     authorized at least $110 million worth of small arms and light
     weapons to the region.(1)  Included in this were nearly 190,000
     guns of various types (handguns through machine guns). El Salvador
     and Mexico were by far the leading destinations for these weapons
     during these two years, with the former slated to receive up to
     33,000 guns and the later 43,000. In addition, neighboring
     Venezuela has been cleared to receive more than 75,000 guns during
     this time. See Appendix 1 for profiles of U.S. arms export
     authorizations to individual countries in Central America.

<p>     Because the State Department previously refused to release any
     information about small arms sales it had licensed, it is not
     possible to determine relative changes in the volume of exports or
     licenses over time. However, the State Department's Office of
     Defense Trade Controls reported in mid-1994 that it had experienced
     a recent noticeable increase in the number of applications for
     firearm and ammunition exports.(2)  And data obtained by
     Congressional investigators showed that during the five year period
     1989-1993 the State Department granted 1,600 export licenses for
     over $100 million of pistols, revolvers and rifles to eight Latin
     American countries.(3)   Thus, it would appear that small arms
     export licenses have increased rather dramatically during the
     period 1996-1997, equalling in those two years the level of small
     arms licensed during 1989-1993.

<p>     These license approvals do not represent final sales. The licenses
     are valid for four years, and it is currently not possible to
     determine how many of these licenses result in actual delivery of
     the weapons.

<h>  Government-Negotiated Sales/Grants

<p>     Through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, the U.S.
     government (represented by the Defense Department) negotiates
     weapons transfers directly with foreign militaries. FMS may cover
     sales or grants of new equipment (purchased by the Pentagon from
     U.S. weapons manufacturers and in effect re-sold to foreign
     militaries), coproduction of weapons overseas, or transfers from
     surplus Pentagon stocks.

<p>     An FMS deal is usually initiated with a request for weapons
     transmitted from the U.S. embassy in the customer country to the
     "implementing agency"--the Army or the Defense Logistics Agency in
     the case of small/light arms. Copies of the request are sent to
     several relevant government agencies, including the State
     Department's Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs, the Defense
     Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) in the Office of the Secretary
     of Defense, and the Unified Command responsible for the region
     where the customer country is located. If no objections are raised,
     the implementing agency, in conjunction with the DSCA, begins to
     prepare the contract for the arms package. By law, the U.S.
     administration must notify Congress 15-30 days before offering a
     sales contract to a foreign customer, if the proposed sale is
     valued at $14 million or more.

<p>     Until recently, the only source of information on past shipments of
     government-brokered small arms sales was through submission of a
     request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), a law
     directing that the executive branch release all requested
     information to the public that is not exempt from disclosure
     (national security and foreign policy reasons are grounds for
     exemption). Detailed information obtained from the Defense
     Department in 1994 showed that between 1980-93, the Pentagon
     transferred nearly 50,000 pistols, over 170,000 rifles and
     shotguns, nearly 1,000 submachine guns, and more than 12,000
     grenade launchers to 49 countries through FMS, including the
     following quantities to the armed forces of El Salvador:

     Freedom of Information Act, 14 September 1994.


<p>     In addition to sales of newly-manufactured weapons, the Pentagon
     gives away or sells at deep discount the vast oversupply of
     small/light weapons that it has in its post cold-war inventory.
     Most of this surplus is dispensed through the Excess Defense
     Articles (EDA) program.

<p>     The Foreign Assistance Act defines EDA as weapons or other items
     owned by the U.S. government, which were not procured in
     anticipation of military aid or sales. Originally only the
     southern-tier members of NATO were cleared to receive EDA, but
     following the 1991 Gulf war, many Middle Eastern and North African
     states were added; anti-narcotics aid provisions expanded EDA
     eligibility to include South American and Caribbean countries.

<p>     Around 1995, large scale grants and sales of small/light arms began
     occurring. In the past few years, over 300,000 rifles, pistols,
     machine guns and grenade launchers have been offered up, including
     the offer of large quantities of M1 rifles to Mexico and small arms
     to Colombia and states in the Caribbean in furtherance of the "war
     on drugs."

<p>     Surplus weapons are also provided to foreign governments under
     special Presidential authority to "draw down" U.S. military
     equipment to meet emergency needs. The Foreign Assistance Act
     provides permission for the President to transfer on a grant basis
     up to $150 million worth of military articles from U.S. stocks
     annually. The executive branch has used this provision increasingly
     in recent years, particularly in support of counter-narcotics
     efforts. U.S. law requires the President to notify Congress of any
     planned drawdowns of equipment, and also to notify Congress upon
     completion of delivery.
     
<h>     Covert Government Arms Supply Operations

<p>     Clandestine U.S. government operations are another way in which
     small/light were exported from or by America to the region.
     Technically speaking, such transfers are not illegal under U.S. or
     international law--although they certainly violate the spirit of
     the U.N. Charter. The National Security Act of 1947 authorizes
     covert political and military operations, including secret arms
     supply. The president must first make a "finding" that the
     operation is vital to U.S. national security. Section 505 of the
     act requires the Central Intelligence Agency, or other government
     agencies engaging in such activities, to notify the Congressional
     committees responsible for oversight of U.S. intelligence community
     activities of any arms supply operation undertaken valued at $1
     million or more.

<p>     Because these programs are classified, little is known with any
     precision about the frequency, magnitude and specifics of covert
     arms supply. In recent years, however, government documents have
     been declassified on some of the earlier operations in the region,
     including the United States' supply of arms to the rebel forces of
     Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas in Guatemala in 1954, and to the
     Cuban exile forces involved in the abortive Bay of Pigs invasion of
     1961.(4)

<p>     More recently, it is public knowledge that during the Reagan
     Administration covert arms supply operations run by the Central
     Intelligence Agency (or the National Security Council) were a major
     source of small/light arms to insurgent groups around the world.
     These operations armed, trained and financed guerrillas fighting
     communist-backed state forces in Nicaragua, Angola, Afghanistan and
     Cambodia. Some of the weaponry supplied was manufactured in
     America; some, in an effort to hide U.S. support of the operation,
     was not.

<p>     Probably the most documented covert arms-supply operation ever
     undertaken by a U.S. administration was the "Iran-contra" affair of
     the mid-1980s. This effort was initiated in 1981, when President
     Reagan signed a classified "finding" to the effect that U.S.
     security would be enhanced by providing covert support for
     paramilitary operations against "the Cuban presence and
     Cuban-Sandinista support infrastructure in Nicaragua and elsewhere
     in Central America."(5)   Ultimately, this operation resulted in
     the delivery of millions of dollars' worth of arms and ammunition
     to the anti-Sandinista insurgents in Nicaragua and, when the scheme
     was finally uncovered, in felony charges against senior officials
     of the Reagan Administration.(6)

<p>     In arming the contras, U.S. operatives generally sought weapons of
     Soviet or Eastern bloc manufacture, thereby allowing the insurgents
     to employ ammunition captured from the Sandinista army, which was
     largely equipped with Soviet-type weaponry. (The use of Soviet-type
     weapons also made it easier for the contras and their backers to
     claim that they were obtaining their arms from defectors or fallen
     Sandinista soldiers, rather than from the United States.) To obtain
     such arms, the CIA drew on a variety of sources. In May 1983, for
     instance, retired Air Force Major General Richard Secord, acting on
     behalf of CIA Director William Casey secretly obtained several tons
     of Soviet-type munitions that had been confiscated from PLO forces
     by the Israelis in 1982. These weapons, and additional ex-PLO
     munitions acquired from Israel in March-July 1984, were then
     transferred to the CIA and, through a variety of clandestine
     channels, passed on to the contras.(7)

<p>     Although the full extent of covert arms aid to the contras has
     never been established, the available documentation suggests that
     it was substantial. In one memo sent to CIA Director William Casey
     in July 1986, retired Major General John Singlaub (a key figure in
     the covert supply operation) discussed a pending delivery of 10,000
     Kalashnikov AKM assault rifles, 200 RPG-7 rocket launchers, 200 60
     mm mortars, 50 82 mm mortars, 60 12.7 mm machine guns, 50 SA-7
     portable surface-to-air missiles, and related ammunition.(8)  Other
     evidence of large arms shipments comes from the transcripts of
     radio communications between the contras and their contacts at the
     CIA. On April 12, 1986, for instance, a rebel field commander
     radioed a CIA official to acknowledge that his forces had just
     received an airdrop of 20,000 pounds of military equipment,
     including German-type G3 assault rifles, rifle magazines and
     ammunition, RPG-7 rockets, grenades, and grenade launchers.(9)
     Because supply operations of this type were conducted on a regular
     basis for several years, it is clear that substantial quantities of
     small arms and other light weapons were given to the contras during
     this period.

<p>     These supply operations would have continued had not an
     Enterprise-owned Fairchild C-123K cargo plane been shot down on
     October 5, 1986, while dropping guns and ammunition over southern
     Nicaragua. The sole surviving crew member, Eugene Hasenfus, was
     captured by the Sandinista army, and, under interrogation, told his
     captors that the contra resupply flights were part of a
     CIA-sanctioned operation.

<p>     In addition to aiding the contras, the United States provided
     covert assistance to special intelligence organizations in
     Guatemala and Honduras during the 1980s and (in the case of
     Guatemala) the early 1990s. These units--the D-2 branch of the
     Guatemalan military and Battalion 316 of the Honduran
     military--were responsible for identifying and, in many cases,
     murdering members of opposition political movements. Typically, the
     victims of these agencies were beaten, tortured, and then
     "disappeared"--that is, executed in secret, with their remains
     hidden in unmarked burial sites. While condemning such behavior in
     public, the Reagan and Bush Administrations secretly approved the
     transfer of CIA funds and equipment to these units on the premise
     that their assistance was needed in the struggle to wipe out
     communism in Central America.(10)  Later, when the Cold War drew to
     a close, the United States continued its support--estimated at $3-5
     million per year--for the Guatemalan D-2, in order (it was claimed)
     to obtain information on illicit drug trafficking in the
     region.(11)

<p>     It is unclear whether small arms were among the items directly
     furnished to these agencies by the CIA. Given Washington's desire
     to boost their effectiveness, however, it is likely that the CIA
     provided them with arms and ammunition or with the funds to acquire
     them.
     
<h>     Illegal Exports

<p>     The final source of American small and light arms to the region is
     completely outside of U.S. law--black market, or "illicit" arms
     transfers. In his key note speech before the 50^th anniversary
     opening of the U.N. General Assembly in 1995, President Clinton
     raised the issue of the illicit arms market, and its role in
     supplying drug traffickers, terrorists and criminals. The U.S.
     President's focus on the illicit arms traffic was spurred, in large
     part, by the growing concerns of the Mexican government about the
     proliferation of illegal U.S. weapons into the hands of Mexican
     drug-traffickers and other criminals. According to the Bureau of
     Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF), Mexico is one of the leading
     recipients of illicitly exported U.S. weapons: In 1993, foreign
     governments reported 6,238 unlawfully acquired U.S.-origin firearms
     to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Over
     half--3,376--were discovered in Mexico.(12)  Guns flow from and
     through America to Mexico and beyond in several ways.

<p>     On 14 March 1997, U.S. federal agents opened two crates in a "left
     cargo" hold at the Otay Mesa border crossing near San Diego,
     uncovering the largest illegal shipment of arms ever intercepted in
     the United States en route to Mexico. The weapons--thousands of
     unassembled grenade launchers and parts for M2 automatic
     rifles--had been sitting unclaimed for two months. The shipment had
     originated in Vietnam, where America left behind large quantities
     of weapons, including M2 automatic rifles. Before the arms returned
     home, they were well-traveled, having gone from Ho Chi Minh City to
     Singapore to Bremerhaven, Germany, through the Panama Canal and up
     to Long Beach, California, where the weapons entered the United
     States in two large, sealed containers.(13)  The contents were
     falsely represented as hand tools and strap hangers, but U.S.
     Customs at Long Beach did not inspect the cargo, since the shipment
     was "in-bond"--that is, the items were simply transiting the United
     States to Mexico. In-bond cargo containers typically remain sealed
     as they move from ship to truck to border. Luckily, this shipment
     was held up at the border because the Mexican freight forwarder
     commissioned to get the crates to Mexico City did not have an
     address for the purchaser.(14)

<p>     The in-bond system is built on trust, and on the Customs
     Department's lack of resources. Customs has fewer than 135
     inspectors at the port of Long Beach, the nation's busiest
     port.(15)  Nevertheless, the Customs Department has successfully
     thwarted a number of illegal arms export efforts, many of them
     involving small arms shipments. For instance, in 1997 several
     defendants were indicted for attempting to export illegally 53
     AR-15 rifles from the United States to Colombia. In another case in
     1997, Customs blocked an attempt to import surface to air missiles
     from Bulgaria for transhipment to Colombia. The Department also
     successfully prosecuted a former Venezuelan secret service agent
     for the unlawful shipment of 120 firearms to Venezuela between
     1993-95.(16)  Unfortunately, there is no way to know what
     percentage of the illegal trade from the United States to Central
     America is being intercepted.

<p>     Large and relatively well-organized arms shipments like the one
     intercepted in San Diego are thought to be unusual. A more routine
     way of smuggling arms across the border is the hormiga (ant) run:
     repeated trips across the border with one or a few guns. A legally
     eligible or "straw" purchaser buys a few weapons (often cheap .22
     and .25 caliber pistols, "38 specials," and 9mm pistols) from gun
     stores in El Paso and other American border towns and hands them
     over to the trafficker, who smuggles them across the border,
     generally either on foot or in the trunk of a car. This process is
     repeated thousands of times a year, as smugglers make repeated
     trips to gun stores and shows in Florida, Texas and California, in
     particular.(17)

<p>     Some legal constraints are now in place, but lack of investigative
     and regulatory resources reduce their efficacy. The "Brady Bill"
     mandates a national system of background checks prior to gun
     purchases. And a rule recently enacted by the Clinton
     administration requires purchasers to show that they have lived for
     at least three months in the state where they are buying a gun. In
     addition, the 1994 assault weapons ban curbs purchases by civilians
     of automatic and semi-automatic weapons.

<p>     The Firearms Owners Protection Act of 1986 (sponsored by the
     National Rifle Association) requires that multiple sales be
     reported to the BATF and local law enforcement agencies, so that
     they can monitor multiple gun purchases and investigate if they
     suspect criminal intent. But currently only three states--Virginia,
     Maryland and South Carolina--have laws that prevent people from
     buying more than one gun a month. In all other states, straw
     purchasers can buy significant quantities of guns and ammunition
     from gun dealers at one time and pass them on to smugglers for
     clandestine shipment. A 1991 BATF report describes a number of such
     transactions, including a 1989 case in which three Arizona
     residents purchased 93 assault rifles and 22 handguns for a well
     known Mexican narcotics trafficker, who then smuggled them into
     Mexico.(18)

<p>     U.S. and foreign military depots are another likely source of
     black-market arms supply. In 1993, the General Accounting Office
     (GAO) found that small arms parts were routinely stolen from a
     number of U.S. military repair shops and warehouses. The parts were
     then sold to gun dealers or to walk-in customers at gun shows
     around the United States. GAO investigators were able to purchase
     military small arms parts at 13 of 15 gun shows they visited. They
     were able to buy everything needed to convert a semiautomatic AR-15
     rifle into a fully automatic M16, as well as 30-round M16 magazine
     clips still in their original packages.(19)  Given the paucity of
     end-use checks performed on U.S.-supplied arms (see table 1), it is
     reasonable to assume that theft of U.S.-supplied small arms from
     depots in Central America contributes to the black market in arms,
     as well.
