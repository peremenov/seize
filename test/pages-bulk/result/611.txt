<h> USCIS Switching to Passport-Style Photo Requirement

<h>   Effective date: Jul. 26, 2004

<p>   In the past, all photos accompanying applications to USCIS had
   to follow so-called "ADIT" style, meaning the photos showed a Â¾ view
   of the applicant' s face. However, USCIS is changing its policy, and
   will now accept passport-style photos (showing a full frontal view of
   the applicant's face). Beginning September 1, 2004, USCIS will require
   that all photos included with newly filed applications be in passport
   style.

<p>   For more information on passport photo requirements, go to the State
   Department's website at
   http://travel.state.gov/passport/pptphotos/index.html.



<h> All Visits to Some USCIS Offices Will Require Appointments

<h>   Effective date: Jun. 1, 2004

<p>   To reduce the long lines around USCIS offices, the agency is beginning
   a new program requiring visitors to make appointments before they
   arrive. The program, called "InfoPass," is already in effect in Los
   Angeles, Miami, and New York. It will soon be expanded to other
   cities.

<p>   If you need to visit USCIS -- whether to submit an application, pick
   up a form, or ask a question -- check the USCIS website first to see
   whether InfoPass is in effect at your local USCIS district office. If
   it is, you have little choice but to make an appointment (some offices
   will allow walk-ins if there's space, but don't count on this).

<p>   Appointments can be made only through the Internet. If you don't have
   a computer with Internet access, go to your local library, or a
   nonprofit organization that serves immigrants. Look for a computer
   with a printer -- you'll need a printout of your appointment notice
   when you visit. (Also, be sure to bring photo identification and any
   paperwork associated with your immigration case to your appointment.)

<p>   To make your appointment, go to www.uscis.gov and click the InfoPass
   link on the right side of the page. You'll be asked to enter
   information and can request when you want your appointment. You can
   use this same website to cancel your appointment, if necessary.


<h> Students and Tourists Affected by New Visa Rules and Procedures

<h>   Effective date: Apr. 8, 2002

<p>   Various rules for obtaining student and tourist visas have changed or
   been added in the years since September 11, 2001. In addition, various
   changes to visa procedures in general will affect tourists and
   students.

<h> New Post 9/11 Security Measures

<p>   Since September 11, 2001, Congress and the immigration authorities
   have introduced various security measures:
   
<l>     * If you're applying for a tourist visa or student visa, don't be
       surprised if you receive more intense questioning than usual. U.S.
       laws already required consulates to check every applicant for a
       record of criminal or terrorist acts -- but now they are being
       even more diligent in following these procedures and are
       forwarding suspicious cases to the Federal Bureau of
       Investigations (FBI).
<l>     * Immigrants traveling inside the United States should carry their
       USCIS identity documents at all times. Immigration inspectors may
       ask immigrants for passports, and/or visa paperwork on airline
       flights between U.S. cities and inspectors are making use of
       little-noticed provisions in the law that require nonresidents to
       carry their green cards or visas and I-94 cards with them wherever
       they go.
<l>     * The laws regarding treatment of immigrant terrorists have been
       amended. The new laws expand the definition of "terrorist" and
       give the U.S. Attorney General the right to immediately expel from
       the United States anyone with suspected terrorist links. It also
       includes mandatory detention of suspected terrorists.

<h> Special Registration for Certain Visitors to the U.S.

<p>   Another of the U.S. government's many post-9/11 security measures has
   imposed extra monitoring on certain people coming to the United States
   on nonimmigrant (temporary) visas. If you're soon to arrive in the
   States, you probably won't know before you get here whether you'll be
   subject to this additional monitoring; the government is trying to
   keep its criteria secret.

<p>   If the border officer decides that you fall under the new registration
   rules, you will have to do all of the following:
   
<l>     * Be fingerprinted, photographed, and interviewed about your plans
       for your stay upon entering the U.S.
<l>     * Send written notification to the immigration authorities on Form
       AR-11SR (available at www.uscis.gov) if you change your address,
       your employer, or your school (this doesn't apply to people who
       stay in the U.S. for fewer than 30 days).
<l>     * Leave the U.S. only through a designated port of departure (there
       are currently about 55 such designated ports).
<l>     * Meet in person with an immigration officer at your port of
       departure on the day you leave.

<p>   You will be given a packet of information more fully explaining these
   requirements when you enter the United States.

<h> Special Registration for Certain Men Already in the U.S.

<p>   Another of the U.S. government's security measures has imposed extra
   monitoring on certain men who are already in the United States on
   nonimmigrant visas. Most of the men affected are students and men on
   extended business or tourist visits. You needed to register at a local
   USCIS office under Phase II if you are a man who:
   
<l>     * was born on or before December 2, 1986
<l>     * is a citizen or national of one of the countries listed below
<l>     * entered the United States on or before certain dates in 2002
       (listed below) on a nonimmigrant (temporary) visa, and
<l>     * planned to stay in the United States until at least your required
       registration date (see below).

<p>   If you fit this criteria and failed to register by the dates below,
   the USCIS has the power to deport you. If you find yourself in this
   position, consult an experienced immigration attorney.

<h>   Countries Affected. The following countries are affected:

<l>     * Afghanistan
<l>     * Algeria
<l>     * Bahrain
<l>     * Bangladesh
<l>     * Egypt
<l>     * Eritrea
<l>     * Indonesia
<l>     * Iran
<l>     * Iraq
<l>     * Jordan
<l>     * Kuwait
<l>     * Lebanon
<l>     * Libya
<l>     * Morocco
<l>     * North Korea
<l>     * Oman
<l>     * Pakistan
<l>     * Qatar
<l>     * Saudi Arabia
<l>     * Somalia
<l>     * Sudan
<l>     * Syria
<l>     * Tunisia
<l>     * the United Arab Emirates, and
<l>     * Yemen.

<p>   Registration Dates. Men from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, and Syria who
   arrived before September 10, 2002 were required to register by
   February 7, 2003.

<p>   Men from Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Eritrea, Lebanon, Morocco,
   North Korea, Oman, Qatar, Somalia, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates,
   and Yemen who arrived before October 1, 2002 were required to register
   by February 7, 2003.

<p>   Men from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia who arrived before October 1, 2002
   were required to register by March 21, 2003.

<p>   Men from Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Jordan, and Kuwait who arrived
   before October 1, 2002 were required to register by April 25, 2003.

<h>   Exceptions. You weren't required to register if you were:

<l>     * a diplomat or other person admitted on an A or G visa
<l>     * a lawful permanent resident (green card holder) or other immigrant
       alien, such as an approved asylee or refugee, or
<l>     * an asylum applicant who filed before November 22, 2002.

<h> Changes to Student Visa Procedures

<p>   The most significant change to the student visa application process
   affects would-be students who are already in the United States on
   another type of visa. These students will need to obtain approval from
   U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS, formerly known as
   the INS) before starting school. Before, foreign students could submit
   applications for student status but begin school before receiving the
   USCIS's okay. Under the new rule, USCIS promises to issue its
   approvals (or denials) within approximately 30 days -- in return for
   which it requires applicants to wait for its decision before starting
   school.

<p>   Another major change for international students is the setup of the
   SEVIS system, a database into which the schools will enter information
   on students, which USCIS can then access via the Internet.

<p>   In theory, students should hardly notice this change, except that it
   puts them under pressure to inform their foreign student officers
   quickly of any changes in their address, student status, or other
   relevant information. In practice, the system has caused frustration,
   as information doesn't always get entered into the system accurately.

<p>   In addition, international students are being closely monitored. When
   a school issues an I-20 to a student, it will be required to notify
   the U.S. consulate in the student's home country. When that consulate
   approves the student's visa, it will be required to notify the USCIS.
   During the student's time at school, the school will have to keep the
   USCIS up to date on the student's status and whereabouts through a
   database called SEVIS.

<p>   To finance this database, international students now must pay $100 in
   addition to the usual visa fees. The information and documents that
   schools are required to make available to USCIS include each
   international student's:
   
<l>     * name, date and place of birth, country of citizenship
<l>     * current address
<l>     * visa classification, date of visa issuance or classification
       granted
<l>     * in-school status (full-time or part-time)
<l>     * date when studies began
<l>     * degree program and field of study
<l>     * whether the student has been certified for practical training, and
       the dates of such certification
<l>     * date that studies were terminated, and the reason, if known
<l>     * written application for admission, transcripts or other course
       records, proof of financial responsibility, and other documents
       that the school evaluated in admitting the student
<l>     * number of credits completed per semester
<l>     * photocopy of Form I-20ID, and
<l>     * record of any academic disciplinary actions due to criminal
       convictions.

<h> Changes to Photo Requirements for Nonimmigrant Visas

<p>   The State Department has announced new requirements regarding the
   photos that must be submitted along with any application for a
   nonimmigrant (temporary) visa -- this includes student and tourist
   visas. The main difference is that the photos must be bigger -- two
   inches square, with your head measuring between 1 inch and 1 3/8
   inches. In addition, the State Department emphasizes that they want to
   see the applicant's full head, including hair and, if possible, ears.
   Head coverings and hats are only acceptable when due to the person's
   religious beliefs, and even then may not cover any portion of the
   applicant's face.

<p>   Also, photocopies of photographs will not be accepted. Digitally
   reproduced photos must be of high qualify, with no visible pixels or
   dot patterns. The photo must be stapled or glued directly on to Form
   DS-156 in the designated space.

<h> Changed Your Address? The Immigration Authorities Want to Know Right Away

<p>   In 2002, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS, now know as
   the USCIS) started to enforce little-known provisions of the
   immigration law that make it a crime for immigrants not to submit
   immediate notifications whenever they change their address. The
   potential punishments include fines, imprisonment, or deportation.

<p>   Here's how to protect yourself: First, figure out whether the law
   applies to you. It covers all foreign nationals who've been in the
   United States for more than 30 days, including those with:
   
<l>     * nonimmigrant status (a temporary visa or permission to be in the
       United States, including a student visa, visitor visa, asylum or
       refugee status, and more), with the exception of those with an "A"
       or "G" visa
<l>     * green cards (lawful permanent or conditional residence), and
<l>     * no status (undocumented or illegal aliens).

<p>   The USCIS requires that you use Form AR-11, sending it to a special
   address set up to handle the mountain of forms it's receiving. And you
   can't just send one form per family -- every member of your household
   needs to have a separate form submitted for him or her. The form and
   the address to which it must be sent are on the USCIS website (in
   various languages) at
   http://uscis.gov/graphics/formsfee/forms/ar-11.htm.

<p>   Form AR-11 itself is fairly self-explanatory. If you don't have an
   A-number (a number the USCIS assigns to people who've applied for
   green cards or have been in removal proceedings), either ignore this
   question or supply your I-94 number. The question about your "last
   address" refers only to your last address in the United States, not
   overseas. The address you supply should be where you actually live,
   not a P.O. Box or work address. There is no fee for filing Form AR-11.

<p>   If you have any applications on file that are waiting for a USCIS
   decision -- for example, you've applied for a work permit -- you need
   to file the change of address form at whichever USCIS office is
   handling your application.

<p>   The time window for filing your change of address is only ten days
   from the date of your move. What if more than ten days have already
   passed and you've only just discovered your responsibility? Most
   attorneys advise that you fill out the form now, to show the USCIS you
   made an attempt to comply and to assure that it has your current
   address.

<p>   Be sure to make a photocopy of your Form AR-11 and any notifications
   you send to other USCIS offices. Then mail everything by certified
   mail with a return receipt. The return receipt is particularly
   important because the USCIS won't send you any separate acknowledgment
   that it has received your form.

<h> Full Middle Name Now Required in All Immigration Forms

<p>   For security reasons, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services
   (USCIS, formerly known as the INS) now asks everyone submitting
   applications to write in their full middle name -- not just their
   middle initial. USCIS would like you to do this even if the form
   you're filling out only asks for your middle initial. If you forget,
   your application won't be denied, but you will get a letter asking for
   your full middle name, which is guaranteed to slow down the USCIS's
   final decision on your application.

<h> Young Men Applying for Tourist or Student Visas Must File Extra Form

<p>   Responding to concerns about the involvement of young men in terrorist
   acts in the United States, the State Department in 2002 instituted
   stricter visa requirements for males. All 16- to 45-year-old male
   applicants for "nonimmigrant" (temporary) visas now have to submit
   Form DS-157 in addition to the usual application materials. This will
   affect mainly those applying for student and tourist visas. To get a
   copy of the new form, go to the State Department's website at
   www.state.gov. Click on "Visas," then click "Visa Application Forms"
   and look for Form DS-157.

<p>   This new form will be mandatory for young men from all countries in
   the world, not just for men from countries suspected of terrorist
   links. However, men from Middle Eastern countries are facing longer
   waits for visas than other applicants.

<h> Check Your Immigration Application's Progress Online

<p>   You can now check the status of your application online, at
   https://egov.immigration.gov/cris/jsps/index.jsp. Be forewarned,
   however -- unless your computer has a fairly new browser, you will not
   be able to access this service.

<p>   Once you've accessed the appropriate Web page, you will need the
   application receipt number from your USCIS receipt notice. If the
   USCIS has failed to send you a receipt notice, you are unfortunately
   stuck with using the old phone system.

<h> Revised Forms Required for Many Immigration Applications

<p>   U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS, formerly called the
   INS) and the U.S. State Department regularly revise the forms used for
   immigration applications. The new versions of some of these forms must
   be used instead of the old versions, even if the changes to the form
   are minor. In some cases, the agency will accept an earlier version of
   the form for a while. If you do use an earlier version for some
   reason, be careful when following the instructions -- in particular,
   the fees stated on the form are likely to have gone up. In addition,
   there are some new forms:
   
<l>     * Form DS-158, Contact Information and Work History for Nonimmigrant
       Visa Applicant. This form is now required of all applicants for F,
       M, or J student visas. It collects family and employment
       information.
<l>     * Form DS-157, Supplemental Nonimmigrant Visa Application. This form
       is now required of all male applicants for nonimmigrant visas who
       are between the ages of 16 and 45, regardless of which country
       they are from. It is designed to bring out information regarding
       potential terrorist tendencies.

<p>   And there's one form you no longer need to send yourself: Form I-538,
   the certification by your designated school official (DSO) that must
   accompany applications requesting a school transfer, reinstatement of
   status, or various work permits.

<p>   The new SEVIS computer system allows your DSO, in most cases, to
   transmit his or her certification directly to USCIS, without using the
   Form I-538. Your school may nevertheless ask you to fill out your
   portion of the form, for its files.

<p>   Copies of new USCIS forms (indicated by the initial letter "I") can be
   obtained from your local USCIS office or by calling USCIS at
   800-870-3676. You can also access the latest USCIS forms online at
   www.uscis.gov (click on "Immigration Forms, Fees and Fingerprints,"
   then on "Forms and Fees," and scroll down until you find the
   appropriate form).

<p>   Copies of new State Department forms (indicated by the initial letters
   "DS") can be obtained from your local consulate.

<h> Visa Waiver Entrants Will Need Passports Containing Biometric Information

<p>   If you're planning to visit the United States using a visa waiver
   rather than an actual visa, you may need to get a new passport first.
   Starting October 26, 2005, all visa waiver entrants must present
   passports containing a digital photograph.

<p>   By the following year, October 26, 2006, they'll need to have
   passports containing other biometric information (probably
   fingerprints), to be announced later.

<p>   Unfortunately, not all countries whose citizens are eligible for the
   Visa Waiver Program have the technology to provide this type of
   passport. If your country doesn't create such passports by the
   deadline, you'll have to contact your local U.S. embassy and apply for
   a tourist visa.
