<h>                     Juggling Nursing School and Family
<h>                             by Diana Bitritto

<p>   Nursing school today attracts many older students who are looking to
   embark on new career paths. However, these mature students often face
   challenges not usually encountered by their younger associates, such
   as work and family.
   
<p>   Juggling nursing school with family responsibilities or a full-time
   job (usually both) is a difficult and often overwhelming task. The
   good news is that there's a vast difference between difficult and
   impossible. This article is intended to help the mature student
   survive and even thrive on the challenge.

<p>     First of all, flexibility is essential - and an important part of
     being a nurse. Kids will fight while you're trying to figure out a
    care plan. The babysitter may call in sick, your car may break down,
     or you might have to work overtime on the day of your final exam.

<p>    If you're taking your courses at college, take it slowly - even one
    course a semester. You may not have the luxury of having the time to
         study several courses at once. You may be able to transfer
   prerequisite college level courses (English, math, or psychology, for
     example). There's also a program called CLEP, which gives college
     credit for life experiences, such as work, travel, or independent
                                   study.

<p>   The student who works outside the health care field may unfortunately
    encounter skepticism from classmates and even some instructors. They
   may challenge you with, "You have it pretty good at your present job.
     Why do you want to go into nursing?" If you wanted to stay in your
        present occupation you wouldn't be attending nursing school.

<p>     Many working students are concerned whether or not they should let
       their boss or co-workers in on their secret. This is a highly
    individual decision which depends greatly on your work arrangements,
   how much school will affect your work, and how well you get along with
    your boss. Bear in mind that a boss's job as well as yours is to act
     in the best interests of the company. It's easier if your going to
            school has a minimal impact on your job performance.

<p>   Bear in mind. that a boss's job as well as yours is to act in the best
    interests of the company. It's easier if your going to school has a
                  minimal impact on your job performance.

<p>    Employers also vary greatly in their flexibility regarding time off.
    Be creative in using your vacation time. You might need only half a
   vacation day to attend an extended clinical or you might skip lunch to
      leave an hour early for last minute exam preparations. Save some
   vacation time for school activities that might otherwise conflict with
    your work schedule. Use your lunch hour to study or even to get in a
         little lab practice if your job is close enough to school.

<p>      Students who are already working in the health care field have a
     distinct advantage. Not only do they have related experience, but
    their employer is more likely to be supportive of their educational
       goals. Every job, however, has attributes that are valuable in
    nursing. A salesperson or receptionist, for example, needs excellent
   communications skills to deal with angry or difficult customers. Other
      positions may require analytical, creative, or critical thinking
   skills, manual dexterity, mathematical aptitude, attention to details,
    or the ability to set priorities. all of these skills are desirable
    qualities for a nurse. Use your job skills to your advantage in your
                                 education.

<p>   Going to school will also have a profound impact on your home life. If
     you pride yourself on keeping an immaculate house, you may need to
   lower your standards. Family members can vacuum or run the dishwasher,
   but only you can study for your exams. However, your family might not
   always give you the support you need. You may come home from clinical
   to a kitchen sink piled high with dirty dishes, an overflowing laundry
   hamper, and two chapters you still have to study for tomorrow. If you
    can afford to hire a cleaning service or send out your laundry, the
   investment could well be worth it in saved time. Prepared frozen foods
                        are also a real time saver.

<p>   Finally, and most important of all, take time for yourself every day.
     This point cannot be stressed enough! Even half an hour to enjoy a
   warm bath, stroll around the block, or read something without the word
    "nursing" in it can do wonders to refresh you physically, mentally,
                              and emotionally.

<p>    It is encouraging to see more evening nursing programs, but nursing
      schools need to be more aware of and address the concerns of the
   student who is trying to balance three different and often conflicting
    roles. For example, the evening LPN program at our county vocational
     school runs for two years as compared to one year for the daytime
    program. It is unrealistic to suggest that working students cut back
     to part-time or quit altogether. Most of them need the income and
   benefits until they can get that first nursing job. They might already
   be concerned about the possibility of having to choose between leaving
    the job and facing financial hardship in order to complete school or
     giving up school - and their dreams. Instructors who treat working
    students with a little extra patience and emotional support will be
     rewarded by these who readily give 200% to their nursing studies.

<p>    Even half an hour to enjoy a warm bath, stroll around the block, or
     read something without the word "nursing" in it can do wonders to
             refresh you physically, mentally, and emotionally.

<p>     Going to nursing school while having to work and care for a family
    requires stamina, self-discipline, resourcefulness, and dedication,
     all of which are prerequisites for being a nurse. The demands are
    numerous on nursing students in their 30s, 40s, or beyond, but their
   maturity and experience are invaluable assets in helping to meet them.
   Older students are highly motivated and usually of excellent quality.
   They bring a wealth of backgrounds, perspectives, and life experiences
                     to enrich the nursing profession.
