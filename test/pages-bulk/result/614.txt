<h>   Structuring Corporate Buy-Sell Agreements
<h>   Securing a Future for Closely Held Corporations 

<h>   By David Joy, Jo Koehn, and Janice Klimek


<p>   Within a closely held corporation, shareholders are often concerned
   about what might occur if one of the owners dies. Will the deceased
   shareholder's family retain the economic value of the corporate
   interest? Can the surviving owners avoid interference from the
   deceased shareholder's family? Will the survivors have the economic
   resources to redeem the deceased owner's interest? Given these
   concerns, corporate owners are best served by entering into a buy-sell
   agreement while they are all alive.

<h>   Forms of Buy-Sell Agreements and Tax Implications

<p>   Owners usually choose from two basic types of buy-sell agreements.
   With a cross-purchase agreement, each owner of the corporation
   purchases an insurance policy on the other shareholders. The purchaser
   is both owner and beneficiary of the policies. Upon the death of a
   shareholder, the other shareholders are then able to use the life
   insurance proceeds to purchase the deceased owner's shares. Another
   commonly used type of agreement is a stock redemption agreement, in
   which the corporation owns policies on the lives of the shareholders.
   When a shareholder dies, the corporation buys the deceased
   shareholder's interest in the company with the insurance proceeds.

<p>   Cross-purchase agreements. The cross-purchase form of the buy-sell
   agreement offers several advantages. The family of the deceased owner
   will have a tax basis equal to the fair market value of the decedent's
   stock at the date of death, thus avoiding any income tax consequences
   as a result of the sale. The fair market value of the shares should be
   defined by the buy-sell agreement (see the Exhibit).

<p>   The life insurance proceeds received by the surviving owners are not
   subject to income taxation. For newly purchased shares, the corporate
   shareholders will be entitled to a tax basis equal to the purchase
   price. The stepped-up basis should reduce future income taxes if the
   surviving shareholders later sell their interests. The insurance
   proceeds are not subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax
   (AMT) and are also not subject to the claims of corporate creditors.
   The AMT avoidance and creditor protection exist because the proceeds
   are paid directly to the individual shareholders.

<p>   The cross-purchase form of the buy-sell agreement carries several
   disadvantages. The plan is difficult to administer if there are
   numerous shareholders that must buy a plan for each other. For
   example, for seven owners to cross-purchase life insurance would
   require 42 (7 Â¥ 6) policies. The number of policies can multiply even
   further if disability coverage is also part of the buy-sell agreement.

<p>   Another disadvantage of the cross-purchase agreement is that age or
   insurability can create a disparity in premiums. Younger or healthier
   owners may incur higher premiums to cover older and less healthy
   owners. A possible solution to this drawback is to have the
   corporation raise salaries to cover the premiums incurred by the
   owners. Inequities may persist, however, if owners' marginal tax rates
   applied to the salary reimbursements are different. Additionally,
   cross-purchase agreement adopters should recognize that the cost of
   funding the buy-sell agreement will be greater if the shareholders
   have a higher tax rate than the corporation.

<p>   Stock redemption agreements. Under a stock redemption agreement, the
   corporation owns policies on the lives of the shareholders. When a
   shareholder dies, the corporation buys the deceased shareholder's
   interest in the company with the insurance proceeds. A prime advantage
   of the stock redemption agreement is that it is easier to administer
   for multiple shareholders. An additional advantage to the stock
   redemption structuring of the buy-sell agreement is that the
   corporation will bear the premium differences associated with age
   disparities among shareholders.

<p>   The corporation will not recognize income for tax purposes when it
   receives the insurance proceeds. The corporation must, however, heed
   the effect of the entire transaction (proceeds received and redemption
   accomplished) on the earnings and profits of the corporation. The
   earnings and profits will increase with the life insurance proceeds
   received and decrease as a result of the stock redemption, so the
   corporation must attend to the overall net effect on earnings and
   profits and consider how that might affect the dividend policy to
   shareholders. For example, in the Exhibit's Scenario 3, the
   corporation may have to issue dividends to avoid the accumulated
   earnings tax on earnings and profits, assuming that the reasonable
   needs of the business do not justify maintaining earnings and profits
   above the $250,000 credit (IRC section 535). These dividends would be
   taxed to the remaining shareholders at ordinary income rates.

<p>   A significant disadvantage of the stock redemption form of the
   buy-sell agreement is that the remaining shareholders do not get the
   benefit of a step-up in basis when the corporation purchases the
   deceased shareholder's interest. The continuing shareholders retain
   their original bases in the company. Compared to the cross-purchase
   agreement, the stock redemption structuring will create greater
   capital gains upon the ultimate disposition of shares if made before
   death. After the stock redemption is accomplished, however, the
   corporate assets should be relatively unchanged (the insurance
   proceeds have been used to purchase the deceased's interest), but each
   owner now enjoys a greater percentage of ownership.

<p>   Estate tax implications. When a cross-purchase plan exists, the
   proceeds from the life insurance are not included in the deceased
   shareholder's estate. The deceased is not the owner of the policy and,
   therefore, the insurance proceeds payable at death are not included in
   the estate. Under a redemption approach, however, the estate tax
   consequences can become more pronounced when the deceased shareholder
   has a controlling interest. A shareholder who owns more than a 50%
   interest either directly or indirectly is deemed to control a
   corporation, under IRC section 267. In this situation, the shareholder
   is deemed to have an ownership interest in the life insurance policy
   due to the shareholder's ability to designate a beneficiary, as well
   as other ownership interests. The fact that control exists over the
   policy in majority ownership instances would result in the proceeds
   being includable in the deceased's estate. Thus, the after-tax returns
   on life insurance policies can be substantially reduced if estate
   taxes are incurred as a result of the life insurance proceeds being
   included in the estate.

<p>   In the case of family-owned corporations, purchase prices specified by
   the buy-sell agreements are often disputed by the IRS as not
   representing fair value. If a corporation owns life insurance for the
   purposes of funding the redemption of the stock, and the deceased
   shareholder owns a controlling interest in the corporation, the
   probability that the life insurance policy will be included in the
   decedent's estate is substantial. Note, however, that if the family
   members own the insurance policy on the decedent, they will receive
   the life insurance proceeds without including them in the taxable
   estate. Thus, the cross-purchase option may be preferable to the
   redemption option.

<h>   Valuation Issues of Buy-Sell Agreements

<p>   There is a distinct difference between the values that should be
   established for the two alternative approaches to a buy-sell
   agreement. This difference is due to the ownership of the life
   insurance policy. In a cross-purchase agreement, the deceased
   shareholder has no economic interest in the life insurance policy on
   his life. Accordingly, the surviving shareholders should expect to pay
   the fair market value of the underlying net assets, which represents
   the value of the business operations.

<p>   Under the stock redemption approach, the corporation owns the
   policies, and therefore the value of the corporation includes both the
   business operations and the insurance policies. The redemption price
   of a buy-sell agreement should typically include a portion of the life
   insurance proceeds. If the stock redemption agreement is so
   structured, the tax implications may be negative, because the life
   insurance proceeds may be subject to both estate tax and income tax if
   the decedent is deemed to possess an ownership interest in the policy.
   Given these tax implications, including the value of life insurance
   proceeds in the buy-sell valuation price may result in an
   unsatisfactory after-tax return.

<p>   Another valuation issue is that the premiums on older shareholders can
   be considerably higher than the premiums on younger shareholders. As
   each unit of stock incurs the same cost, older shareholders will incur
   higher premiums than they would under a cross-purchase plan.
   Accordingly, younger shareholders expect to reap a greater benefit
   from the insurance policies than their older counterparts. Thus,
   younger shareholders would be entitled to a greater benefit at a lower
   cost under a stock redemption approach than for a cross-purchase
   approach.

<p>   This scenario suggests that the redemption price should include a
   portion of the life insurance payments, unless older shareholders are
   compensated for the disparity in the premiums. This would convert
   potentially nontaxable deferred income into accelerated taxable
   income. It would also precipitate similar adjustments for the purchase
   price for younger shareholders. The proper pricing for a buy-sell
   agreement becomes much more complex in the case under the redemption
   alternative.

<h>   Funding of the Buy-Sell Agreement

<p>   Type of insurance. Any buy-sell agreement requires a decision
   regarding the type of insurance policy to purchase. The initial choice
   is between term and whole life insurance. Premiums for term life
   insurance increase throughout the coverage period, whereas premiums
   for whole life are level throughout the coverage period. If the
   shareholder dies in the first few years of coverage, the cost of term
   insurance will be less than the cost of whole life insurance.
   Conversely, the cost of term life may be much greater than whole life
   if an individual exceeds the life expectancy used for underwriting the
   whole life insurance policies.

<p>   Whole life insurance with cash value buildups can offer advantages. If
   policies are held for a significant number of years, the cash values
   of whole life policies can supplement pension benefits or help fund
   shareholder buyouts. Additionally, the policy's cash value is a liquid
   asset of the corporation that may help secure advantageous loan terms
   for the company.

<p>   Shareholders may choose to forgo whole life insurance and purchase
   term insurance. The early premiums saved may be invested in the
   company to either reduce debt or promote growth. In favorable economic
   conditions, the return on investment will typically be greater than
   the earnings attributed to the cash value of the whole life policy.
   The possibility of premium savings in the event of premature death and
   the excess expected returns on premium differences invested are
   advantages for term insurance.

<p>   In addition to cost, insurability is a key consideration. The ability
   to maintain life insurance throughout a shareholder's life is
   important. Whole life insurance policies grant coverage until death
   that may not be cancelled by the insurance company. This feature has
   persuaded many that whole life insurance is the proper means to
   finance corporate buy-sell agreements. The term life insurance
   industry has, however, modified its products so that policyholders can
   purchase term life with the same benefit. This can be accomplished
   with either a guaranteed insurability option or lengthy (20- to
   30-year) policy terms. The addition of a guaranteed insurability
   option to a term policy will increase the cost of the term insurance.
   The increased premium, however, will still be lower than whole life
   premiums in the beginning years. Owners, therefore, must weigh the
   escalating premium structure of term insurance against the early
   returns that might be realized by purchasing less-expensive term
   insurance and investing the premiums saved.

<p>   With time, the value of a successful corporation will grow. Assuming
   the buy-sell agreement ties the purchase price to fair market value,
   owners should ensure that additional life insurance can be acquired
   over time to keep pace with the increasing value of corporate shares.
   Typically, guaranteed insurability options (available on either term
   or whole polices) allow the policyholder to acquire additional life
   insurance at timed intervals.

<p>   When a shareholder dies, several issues arise with respect to policy
   ownership by the deceased and the remaining shareholders in the
   cross-purchase arrangement. The policies insuring remaining
   shareholders but owned by the deceased will carry beneficiary
   designations, generally family members. With whole life, the family
   inherits the cash surrender value of the policies. With no continued
   business purpose, and out of courtesy to the surviving shareholders,
   the surviving family beneficiaries may choose to cash out the value of
   the policies.

<p>   Under a cross-purchase approach, the death of a corporate shareholder
   will not diminish the value of the enduring corporation. Because
   individuals and not the corporation hold the life insurance policies,
   the receipt of death benefits or cash values by the policy
   beneficiaries will not decrease the assets of the corporation. This
   fact does, however, create a funding issue for the remaining
   shareholders. The remaining cross-purchased policies will likely not
   cover the continuing value of the business. The surviving shareholders
   may need to address the shortfall by purchasing additional insurance
   if other funds are not readily available.

<p>   An alternative to purchasing additional insurance would be to use term
   life insurance to fund the buy-sell agreement. The value of a term
   life policy is normally equal to the unearned premium for the year of
   death, usually very small in comparison to whole life insurance. Given
   this low value of term life insurance, shareholders should consider
   purchasing term insurance as joint tenants with rights of survival.
   The insurance policies could then transfer from the deceased
   shareholder to the surviving shareholders without triggering the
   recognition of income upon the death of the insured.

<p>   Uninsurable shareholders. The preceding discussion has assumed that
   the shareholders can obtain new insurance policies on each other. Some
   individuals, however, may not be insurable at the time that the
   buy-sell agreement is adopted. In this case, the only alternative is
   to use an existing policy of the uninsurable shareholder. Such
   shareholders hopefully own whole life insurance policies on their
   lives that have appreciated in value. A shareholder will typically
   expect to be compensated for the cash surrender value of the policy
   upon transferring it to either the corporation or fellow shareholders.
   The most important factor in determining which party to sell the
   policy to is the tax treatment afforded when the insurance proceeds
   are ultimately received. If the corporation purchases the policy, the
   insurance proceeds will not be taxable; if the shareholders purchase
   the policy, the insurance proceeds will be taxable. The shareholders
   must weigh the tax advantages of the corporate stock redemption
   against the tax advantage of using a cross-purchase buy-sell approach.
   If a policy must be purchased because there is an uninsurable
   shareholder, the issues are the same as previously discussed except
   that now the shareholders that have purchased the uninsurable's policy
   must pay taxes when the proceeds are received. Recall that although
   the insurance proceeds will be nontaxable to the corporation when the
   life insurance proceeds are received, the remaining shareholders must
   weigh this benefit against the fact that they will not receive a
   step-up in basis upon the death of the noninsurable shareholder.
   Accordingly, as the percentage of stock owned by the uninsurable
   shareholder increases, the likelihood that a stock redemption buy-sell
   agreement is preferable increases.

<p>   Funding without life insurance policies. Although risk-averse
   shareholders generally prefer to fund buy-sell agreements through the
   purchase of life insurance, not all shareholders are risk averse.
   Risk-seeking shareholders have two alternatives: to invest capital in
   life insurance to fund the buy-sell agreement, or to invest to grow
   (or perhaps to sustain) the corporate business operations. If capital
   funds are limited, shareholders may not have the luxury of funding
   both alternatives.

<p>   Actuaries typically base premiums on a relatively low rate of return
   to the insured. If it were not for the favorable tax treatment
   provided by life insurance proceeds, few would use life insurance as
   an investment. In contrast, the return on corporate business
   operations, especially in the early years, may yield substantially
   greater returns than those offered through life insurance. Thus,
   risk-seeking shareholders may reason that if they live at least as
   long as their actuarially determined life expectancy, the return on
   capital invested should be greater for funds invested in the
   corporation. Another reason not to fund the buy-sell agreement is that
   buy-sell settlements often occur at the date of retirement--not at
   death--leaving no need for life insurance to fund the settlement.

<p>   Shareholders that decide not to fund settlements with life insurance
   typically expect that corporate earnings and profits will increase as
   the corporation matures. In such situations, C corporations often must
   pay dividends to avoid the corporate accumulated earnings tax.
   Alternatively, corporations may elect S status, whereby earnings flow
   through to shareholders and are taxed then at the individual
   shareholder level. Either way, shareholders will likely incur
   increased taxes. Regardless of the corporate form, earnings may be
   strategically accumulated so they can fund needed buy-sell
   settlements. When the corporation executes the buy-sell agreements,
   the estate of a deceased shareholder will receive the proceeds for
   selling the stock without incurring income taxes (the share basis will
   be the fair market value at the date of death). If the buy-sell
   agreements are executed at the date of retirement, not at the date of
   death, retired shareholders will benefit from capital gains treatment.
   Buy-sell agreements should specify an installment purchase option
   (rather than the immediate purchase of shares) where time might be
   needed to accumulate funds for the redemption of the stock (e.g., upon
   the sudden death of a shareholder).

<p>   Combination funding of the buy-sell agreement. Shareholders that are
   more risk averse may choose a combination approach to funding the
   buy-sell agreement. A portion of the buy-sell agreement can be funded
   with life insurance to guard against premature deaths, with the
   remainder funded by accumulated earnings and corporate profits. For
   example, shareholders could initiate a buy-sell arrangement to
   purchase 80% of the stock through a cross-purchase agreement (with
   funding provided by life insurance), and 20% of the stock would be
   redeemed by the corporation upon the death of a shareholder.
   Alternatively, shareholders may opt to initially fund 100% of the
   buy-sell agreement with a cross-purchase design funded by insurance.
   The funding of the agreement can then change annually, with the
   corporation assuming responsibility for purchasing any incremental
   increases in shareholder value as the corporation grows. This approach
   eliminates the need for shareholders to increase the amount of life
   insurance over time. It also provides assurance to the shareholder's
   family that it will receive a minimum amount whether or not the
   corporation can generate the funds needed for the buy-sell
   arrangement.

<p>   The combination approach may be especially appropriate for family
   corporations. Tax law limits the amount of stock purchased by the
   corporation that can be classified as redemption instead of as a
   dividend to the sum of the estate, inheritance, legacy, succession
   taxes, generation-skipping taxes, and funeral and administrative
   expenses allowable as deductions to the estate of the deceased. Share
   value in excess of IRC section 303 limitations may be purchased with
   life insurance proceeds. The basis of this purchase will be the fair
   market value of the shares at the date of death. To remove the value
   of the remaining shares from the deceased shareholder's estate free of
   taxes, the buy-sell agreement should provide a member of the family an
   option to buy the stock from the estate. The family member may then
   choose to exercise the right to purchase remaining shares, as
   determined by the IRC section 303 limitations. The combination
   approach (part corporate redemption, part family member purchase) can
   result in the total value of the deceased's corporate shares being
   extracted from the estate without income tax consequences. The case
   law [see Estate of James J. Durkin, Sr., 99 TC 561 (1992) and Zenz v.
   Quinlivan, 213 F2d 914 (6th Cir. 1954)] indicates, however, that the
   taxpayer must not be obligated to purchase the stock.
