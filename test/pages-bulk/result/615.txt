<h>   Corporate Governance

<p>   Corporate Governance looks at the institutional and policy framework
   for corporations - from their very beginnings, in entrepreneurship,
   through their governance structures, company law, privatisation, to
   market exit and insolvency. The integrity of corporations, financial
   institutions and markets is particularly central to the health of our
   economies and their stability. The OECD Steering Group on Corporate
   Governance co-ordinates and guides the Organisation's work on
   corporate governance.

   improvements, the OECD cautions against rigid standards in this
