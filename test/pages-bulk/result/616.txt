<p>   Church and civil society groups should focus their energy and
   influence on dismantling rich-country protection against the
   labour-intensive exports of great importance to the poor countries.
   But they have to dispel some fallacies about tariff barriers first.

<p>   It is an accepted fact that rich countries have not fully dismantled
   their tariff barriers. It is also a fact that this lack of action
   hurts not only the rich countries themselves, but the poorest of the
   poor countries too.

<p>   These truths have been known, and the situation condemned by
   economists (as well as many policymakers and political leaders), for
   at least a quarter of a century. Indeed, the writings of virtually all
   policy-concerned trade economists and even the research at
   institutions such as UNCTAD have documented, and denounced, rich
   country protectionism for decades.

<p>   The recent castigation of rich-country protectionism by the heads of
   international agencies and in the media, while welcome, is therefore
   little more than a reiteration of the obvious. But the absence of a
   simultaneous and equally pointed focus on the protectionism of poor
   countries, which has also been amply documented by informed trade
   economists, has encouraged several fallacies which can only make it
   harder to reduce protectionism in those countries. These fallacies
   need to be exposed and the latest critics, far too often non-trade
   experts, asked to always condemn protectionism in both poor and rich
   countries, even as they wreak more contempt on the rich ones.

<p>   At the same time, we need targeted input into public policy from
   upstanding groups such as churches, not against free trade, but
   against trade barriers. And since rich-country protectionism against
   the labour-intensive products of the poor countries remains a hard nut
   to crack, we are now working for a Jubilee 2010 movement directed
   against the kind of rich-country protectionism that particularly hurts
   poor countries.

<p>   The following fallacies handicap the removal of poor-country
   protectionism.

<h>   Fallacy 1

<h>   Rich-country protection is higher than poor-country protection.

<p>   Many poor-country politicians have exploited the focus on rich
   countries protectionism to say that this system of trade barriers is
   unfair to them, in the sense that trade barriers are asymmetrically
   higher in the rich countries, especially if they are measured only
   against the poor countries exports. But the facts about tariff
   barriers in the rich and poor countries do not bear this out. In fact,
   it is still true that, on average, poor countries have higher
   protection than rich ones. This is evident from the graph below,
   drawing upon work by Michael Finger and Ludger Schuknecht (see
   references). Thus, for industrial products, rich-country tariffs are
   at 3% compared with 13% for poor countries. Even in textiles and
   clothing, the poor-country tariffs at 21% exceed the rich-country
   tariffs at 8%.

<p>   To be sure, not all developing countries are equally protectionist.
   For many years now, Singapore and Hong Kong China, which have traded
   their way out of developing country status, have been textbook
   examples of free-trading economies. Likewise, protection levels in
   middle-income areas such as the Republic of Korea and Chinese Taipei
   are not markedly higher than in developed countries. But the countries
   that stand to benefit most from competition are precisely those that
   have the highest protection. These include most countries in South
   Asia and Africa, whose average tariff levels are markedly higher than
   the average both for developing countries and for developed countries.

<p>   True, the peaks in tariffs in developed countries are concentrated
   against the exports of poor countries, and applied with potency to
   basic products like textiles and clothing, footwear and fisheries. But
   as UNCTADs estimates show, even the peak tariffs in developed
   countries apply to only about a third of developing country exports.
   Furthermore, as Messrs Finger and Schuknecht document, much of the
   protection against developing country exports is concentrated in
   developing countries themselves: in other words, protection against
   each other. As to non-tariff barriers, particularly anti-dumping
   actions, the developing countries are rapidly catching up with
   rich-country practices and excesses. Economists Michael Finger,
   Francis Ng and Sonam Wanchuk have estimated that, during 1995-99, rich
   countries initiated 401 anti-dumping actions whereas poor countries
   started 464. Anti-dumping actions are proliferating and are no longer
   the exclusive weapon of the rich countries. In short, trade barriers
   do not appear to be asymmetrically stacked against poor countries.

<h>   Fallacy 2

<h>   Trade barriers against poor countries reflect hypocrisy on the part of
   rich countries.

<p>   This is a sentiment voiced by many pro-poor NGOs. Yet a closer look at
   the existence of poor country protectionism reveals a more prosaic
   explanation of rich country protectionism. The persistent presence
   (despite the general and immense postwar liberalisation of trade by
   the rich countries) of protection against the labour-intensive exports
   of the poor countries can be partly, perhaps even largely, explained
   as a consequence of reciprocal bargaining. As long as the poor
   countries received most-favoured-nation treatment in trade rounds, and
   the prevailing orthodoxy that their protectionism was not harmful to
   them and that they were too underdeveloped to liberalise exempted them
   from having to make any trade concessions, the rich countries
   proceeded to make tariff reductions in goods that were of interest
   only to themselves. Of course, until the late 1980s, rich countries
   were indifferent towards the rather small markets poor countries had
   to offer. But this changed as many of these markets expanded.

<h>   Fallacy 3

<h>   It is wrong to ask the poor countries to lift their trade barriers
   when there are trade barriers in the richcountries.

<p>   This view was echoed at a conference in New Delhi, when Nicholas
   Stern, Chief Economist, World Bank, said it was surely hypocritical of
   rich countries to encourage poor countries to liberalise trade and to
   tackle the associated problems of adjustment, while at the same time
   succumbing to powerful groups in their own countries that seek to
   perpetuate protection of their narrow self-interest. As a political
   principle, this seems sound, but in economics, it is an elementary
   error. As Joan Robinson famously said, if your trading partner has
   rocks in his harbour, that is no reason to throw rocks into your own.
   Many western NGOs and some church groups that often echo Mr Sterns
   argument fail to understand that protection does the poor nations no
   good. Rather, it adds to the harm.

<p>   In fact, the proper and helpful way to put the argument is quite
   different: that, politically, it is harder to make progress on trade
   liberalisation worldwide when rich countries themselves have massive
   subsidies and protection.

<h>   Fallacy 4

<h>   Exports from poor countries fail to grow because of protection in rich
   countries.

<p>   A small yes but a big No. Even as rich-country protection is properly
   condemned, protectionism in poor countries is quite often the chief
   culprit in their dismal export and economic performance. To understand
   this, consider a simple analogy. Imagine you are a poor country. Two
   doors come between you and the rich-country mansion. The mansions door
   may be closed: this is rich-country protection. But you must also get
   past your own door, and that may be closed: this is poor-country
   protection and creates a bias against exports. We might also add: even
   if both doors are open, there may be no traction in your legs and you
   need therapy; this is the supply capability question on which there
   has been considerable attention of late. We feel the almost exclusive
   focus on this aspect has been too static and does not adequately allow
   for the fact that, if both doors were open to a reasonable degree,
   there would be an incentive to acquire the missing traction.

<p>   Thus, in regard to these doors, consider the outward-oriented Far
   Eastern economies, which either pursued free-trade policies (Hong Kong
   and Singapore) or, in second-best fashion, offset the anti-trade bias
   of their protection, albeit in a less desirable fashion through export
   subsidies (Republic of Korea and Chinese Taipei). They managed to
   register a huge export performance, whereas import protection in
   countries like India hurt their own exports. Yet both sets of
   countries faced virtually the same trade protectionism abroad. The
   postwar experience strongly underlines the propositions that export
   pessimism is self-fulfilling and that incapability feeds on itself,
   whereas those who set their policies to exploit foreign markets have
   usually found it possible to do so, and overcome protectionism abroad.

<h>   Jubilee 2010: targeting rich-country protection against poor
   countries.

<p>   So, the fallacies that are fatal to the economic health of the poor
   countries can be refuted. That should help restore our focus on the
   real need to reduce protection in poor countries that need to go
   further. But what about rich-country protectionism?

<p>   Evidently, multilateral trade negotiations are important, and the
   recent launch of a new round at Doha, with an explicit mandate to
   address the tariff peaks in the rich countries, is a welcome
   development. But surely we should also harness the energies and
   sentiments of civil society groups, including church groups in
   particular, to eliminate protectionism. At Seattle and elsewhere,
   these groups marched alongside protectionists, identifying themselves
   wholly with rich-country workers in most cases, though some, equally
   without sound justification in our view, attacked trade for hurting
   the welfare of workers in poor countries.

<p>   These groups forget that it takes two to tango, that they should
   promote the wellbeing of workers not just in the First, but also in
   the Third World, together and at the same time. This requires that
   church and civil society groups put their weight behind the
   dismantling of protection against the labour-intensive exports of
   great importance to the poor countries, albeit at a pace and with
   institutional support for adjustment and retraining that are
   compatible with a humane concern for our workers.

<p>   Hence our call over a year ago for a Jubilee 2010 movement (inspired
   by the Jubilee 2000 movement that finally led to debt relief) where
   free traders, church groups and NGOs join forces to dismantle
   rich-country protectionism by 2010, in a progressive set of targeted
   reductions of trade barriers on labour-intensive goods where poor
   countries have marked production advantages. These reductions would be
   accompanied by substantial infusion of funds to retrain and relocate
   any poor, displaced workers in the rich countries.

<p>   We are happy to note that UN secretary-general, Kofi Annan, at the
   Brussels conference on development last year (when the far less
   significant anything-but-arms initiative to grant tariff-free access
   to 99% of imports from the worlds 48 poorest countries was announced
   by the European Union) brought the Jubilee 2010 idea before the
   assembled NGOs. We plan to follow through this idea whose time, we
   believe, has come.
