<h>   Rocking Rolling Stone

<p>   Set in the offices of a fictional Rolling Stone magazine, "Corporate
   Rock" is a very loose comedy about the pathetic state of mainstream
   music redeemed by some very funny screwball antics.

<p>   "It's better to burn out than to fade away," the house misfit mentions
   to the big boss at this fictionalized version of the Rolling Stone
   offices, and he's promptly told to quit quoting Hunter S. Thompson all
   the time. Thus has the onetime chronicle of the counterculture evolved
   to the MTV-ified present day.

<p>   Those who recognize the quote above (including most readers of this
   article, I hope) will also remember the other signature line from the
   same song: "Rock and roll will never die." Neil Young was probably in
   anthemic rather than ironic mode when he wrote those lyrics, or he
   might have foretold the actual death throes of rock and roll, which
   are what the show "Corporate Rock" is all about.
   
<p>   Over the top and under the top, overacted and underacted, ridiculously
   campy and occasionally earnest, William Bennett's play cranks out riff
   after comedic riff in the hopes that something in there will rock your
   world. Sometimes it does.
   
<p>   Dylan (Travis York), the misfit who is the magazine's last connection
   to the soul of rock and roll, squanders his days writing articles
   about bands with names like Underkill and the Knights Who Say Neat,
   which get filed away on the web site while the magazine's bigger names
   churn out repeated cover stories on Britney Spears and the plastic
   surgeons to the stars. (It's better to churn out than to fade away,
   you might say.) The closest thing he gets to a big break is the chance
   to edit the mag's star writer, Nathaniel Hunger (a permanently leering
   Jamie Benge), which actually means keeping him from falling out of his
   chair long enough to half-finish a piece of minimally publishable
   prose.

<p>   A cockamamie plot ensues in which something happens to make Nathaniel
   disappear, Dylan surreptitiously usurps his byline for the duration,
   and the whole thing is given a screwball wrapup involving a Russian
   call girl, French heavy-metal gangsters (huh?), and an argument about
   Def Leppard.
   
<p>   Whether any of this holds together as a convincing comedy, the play
   has a number of hilarious individual moments. Besides a few of Dylan's
   choicest pronouncements on the lame pop stars of the moment, there are
   several great visual gags (the handshakes alone are a hoot), and Aaron
   Haskell as a high-pitched white hip-hopper borders on the
   unintelligible but can be mad funny.
   
<p>   And somewhere behind the play's shenanigans is a message about the
   heat death of our cultural universe. The last time I read Rolling
   Stone was probably 18 years ago, when the likes of Phil Collins on the
   cover were already advertising the magazine's creeping irrelevance, so
   I can't say exactly how much more out of touch it may be today. But of
   course one magazine's failure of nerve doesn't mean rock and roll is
   really dead -- today's Hendrixes and Cobains have just been pushed
   back under the radar where, perhaps, they belong. Today's rock
   
<p>   "Corporate Rock" isn't the most eloquent takedown of our tepid mass
   culture, but most of the audience walked away well entertained. From
   director Timothy Haskell and some of the other talents behind last
   year's self-explanatorily raucous hit "Road House: the stage version
   of the cinema classic that starred Patrick Swayze Except This One
   Stars Taimak from the 80's Cult Classic 'the Last Dragon' wearing a
   Blonde Mullet Wig," it's another anything-goes tag-team mÃ©lÃ©e of a
   play, only this time with less fighting and more arguing about whose
   favorite band sucks. In more subject-appropriate terms, it's a play
   with one part Frank Zappa to every two parts Dweezil.
