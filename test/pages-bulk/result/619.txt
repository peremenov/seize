<h>   Subject: Leviticus 18.22; 20.13

<p>   It's another month, and OPERATION: REBIRTH is still making progress.
   This Bible Study alone is helping so many people; it's hard to keep up
   with the "thank you" emails we get. We thank God for the opportunity
   to invest into the lives of people all over the world. It's not a
   responsibility we take lightly. We consider it a blessing, not a
   burden to do the work that we have been able to do. We also look
   forward to continuing the work of speaking life, healing and truth.

<p>   This month we will be dealing with two of the most quoted scriptures
   people use in their stance against the same-gender loving community.
   Leviticus 18.22 says "Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with
   womankind: it is abomination." And Leviticus 20.13 says "If a man also
   lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have
   committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their
   blood shall be upon them." On the surface, it's a closed case. With a
   literalist interpretation of this scripture, the act of same-gender
   sex is wrong, and in the eyes of God is punishable by death. We will
   delve deeper into this issue and "take a closer look" at this
   scripture. Hopefully, those who read will be enlightened and liberated
   from church imposed guilt and shame. So, let's begin

<p>   When looking at the "Levitical Holiness Code", we must understand that
   it was a code of conduct that was part of a covenant that required the
   children of Israel to not participate in the religious rituals of the
   Canaanites once they entered the land God promised to them. They were
   to remain separate in every way. They were not to eat with the
   Canaanites, intermarry, worship with/or like them. They were to remain
   "holy" or set apart. In obeying this covenant, they would prove
   themselves to be God's chosen people. They would be instantly
   identifiable as the people of covenant. This same code also prohibits
   the eating of certain foods, wearing certain types of clothes, and
   also discriminates against people with disabilities as it relates to
   worship and the priesthood.

<p>   We must also remember that it was always in the forefront of the minds
   of the people of Israel the covenant made with their patriarch
   Abraham. God promised Abraham that he would make of him a mighty
   nation. A nation whose number would be like that of the stars in the
   sky or the sand of the sea. He would be the Father of many people.a
   great nation (Genesis 17.5). So when making laws, or instituting a
   code of conduct that would govern their actions they had to keep in
   mind that God's covenant with the father of their faith was to make
   them a great nation. They could not participate in anything they
   thought would hinder or keep them from fulfilling that covenant.

<p>   In taking a closer look at these two verses, we will look at the
   transliteration from Hebrew to English. In taking each character of
   Hebrew into English, Leviticus 18.22 looks like this

<p>   "V'et zachar lo tishkav mishk'vei ishah to'evah hu"when translated
   into English reads "And with a male thou shalt not lie down in beds of
   a woman; it is an abomination."

<p>   Leviticus 20.13 looks likes this

<p>   "V'ish asher yishkav et zachar mishk'vei ishah to'evah asu shneihem
   mot yumatu d'meihem bam" when translated into English reads "And a man
   who will lie down with a male in beds of a woman, both of them have
   made an abomination; dying they will die. Their blood is on them."

<p>   We are going to look at the words "mishk'vei" and "to'evah" and it
   will give us a better understanding of what these verses are trying to
   say. First, the word "mishk'vei" is a noun. The main form of it is
   "mishkav, and the root letters of the noun, sh-k-v are the same
   letters of the verb root in the verse (lie down). Mishk'vei is in the
   plural construct state, meaning "beds of", and the noun "ishah" means
   woman. To'evah is translated "abomination" in English. Yet the
   definition is key to the interpretation of the verse. Most define this
   word as "disgusting" or "detestable". Others simply define it as
   "improper" or "unclean", as if to say "good Jews just don't do that".

<p>   With what we know now, the verse says a man cannot, or should not lie
   down with a man in the bed of a woman. During this time period, a
   woman was considered property. And since women were considered unclean
   during certain times of month, they had beds of their own. Other than
   the woman herself, nobody was permitted to sleep in her bed but her
   husband. Husbands often didn't sleep in the same bed with their wives
   unless they were there for the express purpose of having sex with
   them. And there were rules which said when he could do that. So this
   verse is more about WHERE same-gender sex could occur, and not about
   the sex itself.

<p>   Now just why would the author even bring this up? Well, the
   Canaanites' religious rituals or worship included sex acts. They
   worshipped fertility gods who were thought to bring blessings on their
   crops, livestock, children, etc. During these rituals, everyone
   participated. Even relatives would have sex with one another. They
   would also burn babies as sacrifice at the altars built to these
   fertility gods. And since incest, human sacrifice, and having sex
   anywhere was part of the worship, the Israelites were not permitted to
   perform these acts if they were going to be different and separated
   unto a Holy God.

<p>   The sex acts were prohibited because of religious reasons, more
   specifically idol worship. This law was not a blanket prohibition of
   sexuality. The entire code was meant to keep Israel from engaging in
   the religious practices of the Canaanite people. The argument here is
   religious, not moral or ethical. If the Jews of this time period were
   to maintain a strong identity, and build a large nation, they could
   not be like the people around them in any way or form.including their
   worship.
