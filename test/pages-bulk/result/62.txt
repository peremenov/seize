<p>   I am someone that has been hypnotized two years ago,and can not get
   out of it still, it feels so wired, I can not even control my body,
   and it took me time to understand that i have been hypnotized, and
   that something has happened to me, I thought it is some sort of a
   magical thing, but with time i realised that i have been hypnotized,
   it feels like i am a dummy,a pupet and someone is moving my orgins,
   does anyone has an explination for that, and is it connected to
   hypnotism?

<p>   Why do you think you were hypnotized?
<p>   You're talking about a lot of things which could have other causes.
   I'm not saying it didn't happen, I'd just like to know more about the
   events that resulted in your conclusion.

<p>   Dear Don,
   I have to ask if a hypnotized person doesn't naturally get out of it?
   I guess i can telepythically still can contact the hypnotizer this is
   one thing, 2ed thing the I feel a strange energy inside my body that
   moves my mecseles and orgins, it's has been 2 years by now and still
   not going, that might be scarey for some people but i really didn't
   know what happened, I thought it is a black magic or something like
   that,cause it feels like it.And it lookes like the hypnotizer herself
   did something wrong, installing my body's energy into some doll or
   something like that I do not know much about it so i am asking for
   help

<p>   Haitham,
   Hypnosis is a method of learning.
   Like when you were a child and learned quickly and easily.
<p>   So no, you don't 'get out of it'
   Just like when you learned to walk, you don't 'get out of it', you
   remember how to walk.
<p>   If the description you are giving is from hypnosis, then you simply
   need help no learn something different.
<p>   Just because you learn something, doesn't make it good. But you can
   learn something different now.
<p>   If you were hypnotised, and I don't know if you were, then the
   hypnotist suggested, or taught you to feel this way.
<p>   If this is true, then there is no hypnosis to break, no magic to
   break.
   There is only the need to learn to feel or be different.

<p>   Ill assess that you are indeed successfully hypnotized, to your
   detrement, and I would submit that it is irrlevent whether it was
   someone else, or you yourself, who has done it.
<p>   I too am suffering from hypnotism.
<p>   I am benifitting far more than I am suffering now, because I have
   learned how to use it, instead of just being a pawn.
<p>   What do you want to do?

<p>   You are receiving comments from four different and competent sources
   at once. Were else could you get this service, and free to boot
   (G).....
   Now Skip has accepted that you were indeed hypnotised, and has replied
   based on that asumption. I will now suggest to you, that reading what
   you offered us shows no indication that hypnosis is involved, so
   unless you can offer more detail, I will take the oposite tack to Skip
   and say NO you were not hypnotised, and await further proof that you
   were. If on the other hand, you still feel that you need help via our
   art, you will need to consult a qualified practitioner for that, since
   nothing can be accomplished via the internet. Please note, whether
   hypnosis was involved in the past or not, it can still be of help if
   properly used... Terry

<p>   Terry,
   No doubt you would agree that this fellow has at least hypnotized
   himself into believing that he has been hypnotized to his detrement.
<p>   From my perspective, it was immaterial whether someone else, or he
   himself, was the 'author' of his current trance, he is in a crummy
   trance, and might wish to choose another.
<p>   cheers,

<p>   Thanks everybody,
<p>   Next, well guys How it happened I had a friend that eachtime she calls
   my name i show up, then it devolpoped that i show up eachtime that she
   thinks about me, then somehow i nolonger see her but in a way i feel a
   strange energy moving my muscels,it feels like i am attached to some
   strings, that are moving my body with no intention from my part, and i
   swear to you guys that i've been into it for 2 years by now.
   Is it a medical proof you need, although I am not an expert but i went
   to a Foranp labo. in France withing that period, it first
   started,finding out that my heartbeats anylisis and brain activity are
   bizar as well.
<p>   ok dudes, now is there a way that i can just wake up, telling myself
   that I am gonna get out of it and suddenly wake up, or is there
   another way to do, cause my friend- the girl that i am assuming that
   has hypnotized me, is nolonger in touch with me, meaning either she
   does not want to wake me up, thinking that it is silly,probably it is
   not hypnotism, taking into consideration that hypnotism should not
   last for more than 5 min 'trans' if you loose connection with the
   hypnotizer!

<p>   Evidently I am not communicating successfully my intent. I am
   apparently communicating successfully, something other than my intent.
<p>   Haitham, the trance, you are in, includes, among other things, the
   notion that you are being controlled, by someone else.
<p>   To the extent that you believe this to be true, it will be true for
   you. And you will feel, however it is, that your imagination says, you
   'ought' feel, if you were controlled. And as a human being, your mind
   will find 'evidence' to support your belief, and it will ignore
   information that points to descrepencies in your belief.
<p>   Now a hypnotherapast can 'enter into your hallucination', with you,
   and choose to work from within it. This will give him/her instant
   rapport, for you will say, "At last someone, who, unlike everyone
   else, truly understands my situation! They must be pretty smart!" And
   for a bit, they will take you further into the hallucination, before
   they, hopefully, lead you 'out'.
<p>   Others might take the approach of saying, "People cannot control
   others using hypnosis in the way you describe. The best mind control
   techniques known today dont leave people feeling as you describe."
   They would say, "You are not being controlled by this person, except
   in so far as you believe you are being controlled, and are acting
   accordingly." This would be true and factual information.
   Unfortunately you would be very likely to reject it, because you
   "know" you are being controlled, and anyone who says otherwise, is
   simply wrong, and their oninion is therefore invalid.
<p>   I am taking an approach that is somewhat in between the two described.
<p>   I say you are right, you are in a trance and you are being ontrolled.
<p>   The only mistake, you are making, is in, "Who is the one really doing
   the controlling?"
<p>   It is a mistake to believe this woman is in control of you. And she
   certainly isnt using hypnosis to pull your strings, assuming she is
   pulling your strings. Women dont need hypnosis to pull men's strings,
   they have something much more powerful and prevasive. :)
<p>   My point is that you are the one in control. I recognize that it
   doesnt feel like that to you, yet, but it is true none the less. Now,
   you may need the assistance of a hypnotherapast to assist you in
   realizing this. And to assist you in choosing the direction you want
   your life to go from here.
 <p>  BUT the bottom line is that a hypnotist can only "assist you", they
   can not do it 'for you', or 'to you'.

<p>   Was she a friend or aquaintance? Did she say "I am hypnotizing you",
   or "would you like to try this" out? Were you physically attracted to
   her? When she was "thinking" about you and you "showed up" did she
   actually say "I was just thinking of you and wanted to see you"? Or
   did she say something like, "that's funny, I was just thinking of you
   , but I never expected you to show up".
<p>   I think sometimes there are "coincidences" or cosmic forces or
   whatever you want to call it, but the fact that you no longer have
   contact with her, is that your choice or hers? My suggestion is to
   visualize cutting the cord that binds you to her if that is what you
   want. If you feel like a puppet, cut the strings.
<p>   I am sure many of us can relate to those relationships/acquaintances
   where there is a very strong urge/attraction to go see someone
   (whether it is mutual or not).
   Do what you need to do, that is in your best interest, and highest
   good and if you can't do it alone, find someone who can help.
<p>   Good Luck

<p>   Hi Steve, though I don't ascribe to the idea that magnets in a headset
   can affect the brain, I do know of research that is going on regarding
   the effects of magnetic waves on both electronic equipment, and on the
   mind. At present the investigation is being done on cows exposed to
   overhead power lines, and equiment in areas close to power stations.
   It makes sense that any therapist conversant with these activities
   should take precautions, but in any case, wearing headphones seems
   very anti social to me, since it shuts out the rest of the world,
   causing any person at risk to persue avoidance of others...Now it
   would only work for those persons so disposed, so kids who do it
   because they want to listen to music instead of mom, are not likely to
   do themselves harm (G) unless of course it results in a smart clip
   behind the ear, which is what I would have got if I didn't pay
   atention to mom.....

<p>   Hi Terry,
<p>   Thanks for the "Hi Steve," but I hadn't yet participated in this
   thread.
   But, it caught my attention so I'll chime in a bit. There is a
   commercial
   presently airing that is asking for volunteer subjects to test the
   therapeutic use of magnets for depression. I don't know anything
   about the study, but hope it shows them to be safe and effective
   for this condition.
<p>   I did a little research on magnets prior to using one to resolve a
   TMJ karate injury. I was the subject of my own study. It seemed
   to work for me with this injury (using a "north pole facing" magnet,
   12,500 gauss).
   I know that research is going on concerning "pulsed wave" application
   of magnets.
<p>   I personally would be cautious of some electromagnetic radiation.
   My understanding is that "ham radio operators" have
   increased risk factors linked to their exposure. You speak of cows.
   I'm glad that they are investigating their exposure to overhead power
   lines. Aside from my concern for the cows, it would be great to have
   the agriculture lobby counterbalance the influence of the power
   industry,
   in encouraging study and protective measures if and where there may
   be problems. (I've heard of cows being affected by low levels of
   electrical leakage from improperly insulated lines.)
<p>   The more I learn about energy medicine, the more I'm inclined to
   believe
   that structure and function of the body (including the brain) are
   affected
   by magnetic fields.

<p>   Hello Haitham,
<p>   I have no idea whether you were hypnotised or not, whether you have
   remained in this mysterious 'trance', or not.
<p>   What I do know is that you seem to believe your were and are.
<p>   My instinct is to ask you to get some help, possibly from a
   psychiatrist, but since I do not know you or the truth of your posts,
   I will not do that.
<p>   What I will say is that you have a belief that your life has been
   altered for the worse by what appears to be 'covert hypnosis', and if
   this 'covert hypnosis' has actually taken place then any decent
   hypnotherapist can help you to remove it's effects.
   Jack

<p>   Guys, do you really think someone can get stuck in Hypnosis?
<p>   I think it was just the most logical explanation Haitham found for
   himself regarding his situation... Maybe he is so skilled in entering
   hypnosis (like a somnabulist would) that he confuses it with getting
   stuck.

 <p>  Haitam,
<p>   say clearly as a command to your mind and yourself many times each
   day,
<p>   "nobody either in the flesh or out of it can hypnotise me. I am free
   from all hypnosis. No outside influence other than Divine influence of
   good can affect or control me. My entire mind is protected and shuts
   off all unnecesary outside control. I am in control of myself and my
   own mind, I am absolutely completely freed from all hypnosis. God is
   my protector and only influence, and it is so!"
<p>   The author Ernest Holmes (who could heal people of cases of illness,
   eyesight problems, false or wrong beliefs, even insanity) cured a
   woman who believed she was posessed by evil spirits with that
   affirmation everyday. In about a week the 'spirits'(whether they were
   real or just subconscious parts who used to tell her nasty and
   demaning things) told her "we are leaving now, we were just your
   subconscious parts (of guilt? etc?)" .
<p>   During the day, use that affirmation everytime to replace the
   thought/belief that you are being hypnotised. You can use "I am free
   from all hypnosis" or "(say your name in full) is freed from all
   hypnosis."
 <p>  Ernest Holmes believed that there is one superconscious mind which
   receives our thoughts, and that healing can take place with
   affirmation by yourself to your subconscious mind, or affirmation by
   other people towards you thru the superconscious mind.
<p>   How is it that we can sometimes think about someone and they suddenly
   give us a telephone call, or we meet them in unexpected places? It is
   because a mental link was established in the superconscious by your
   subconscious minds. This can be done by suggestions, belief, or
   THINKING too much about the other person. Lots of lovers in this world
   can attest to this. Carl Jung calls this SYNCHRONICITY- a link of the
   subconscious.
 <p>  I had the same thing many times. When I like someone, I will always
   meet them unexpectedly in unexpected places. Even if I dont know them
   yet. Many times meet someone whom I think is beautiful, and I tell my
   own subconscious "I will meet her again and again, you know how to do
   it". Once, I met this girl at least 10 times over a period of 1 month,
   sometimes in the cafe, or just on the street, etc. The way to stop
   that post-hypnotic command is to say "This is the last time I will
   meet her" or something like that.

   can attest to this. Carl Jung calls this SYNCHRONICITY- a link of the
   subconscious.
<p>   Respectfully, Jung did not consider synchronicity to be a link of the
   subconscious. Rather synchronicity is simply the conscious mind
   putting meaning into meaningless coincidence (an acausal connecting
   principle). Example: I think about a person and the person calls me.
   Synchronicity: my thinking their must be some relationship between the
   two events rather than the fact that they are unrelated.
<p>   As a psychologist, hearing about invented relationship between
   unrelated events from his patients was valuable to uncovering the
   workings of the unconscious. As such, hearing about synchronicities is
   as valuable to a psychologist as is hearing about dreams.
<p>   The only real relationship is one of time: A occured before B. With
   synchronicity, a person who observes that A occured before B posits
   that there must be some further relationship between A and B other
   than one of time. Positing that A caused B and saying it is
   "synchronicity" does not really say anything, although many people
   believe that it does. The term, as used by Jung, merely defined the
   nature of an invented relationship. Today people use it as if it
   describes the causal relationship of events when, in fact, it does
   not.

<p>   Hi, Yes you are right, Jung came up with the term synchronicity and
   made it popular. Many believed he came up with a great concept, but he
   limited it into the confines of science- for he could not prove that
   the mind can create or cause coincidences (rather than just linking 2
   events that are totally unrelated. Maybe they ARE related, but such is
   the limit of Scientific logic that whatever cannot be proven should be
   left aside as a question, thus never used as a possible strategy.
   However Quantum Physicist have agreed that the observer has the power
   to change the result of the experiment, just by his
   expectations/thoughts).
 <p>  "Jung believed in astrology, spiritualism , telepathy, telekinesis, clairvoyance and ESP.
    In addition to believing in a number of
   occult and paranormal notions, Jung contributed two new ones in his
   attempt to establish a psychology rooted in occult and
   pseudoscientific beliefs:
   synchronicity and the collective unconscious."
<p>   From his beliefs, we can see where his influence and notion of
   synchronicity came from, however, 'coincidences' was about the ONLY
   thing nobody can prove to other people in a scientific experiment. We
   can with telekinesis, telepathy, etc, but not with 'creating
   coincidences'.
<p>   But many philosophers after Jung used his term in a broader sense.
   Deepak Chopra uses 'synchronized events' to express the mind's
   (spiritual?) power to create opportunities by synchronizing (arranging
   rather than just merly linking) events. This goes further beyond
   Science into the Spiritual.
 <p>  Wayne Dwyer wrote a chapter about Syncronicity in one of his book "You
   Will See It When You Believe It". He wrote about an experience that
   changed him completely. He hated his father when he was young, because
   his father was an alchoholic and abandoned Wayne's family. He was so
   filled with hate and anger, and was on a journey to search for his
   father's whereabouts. One day he was led by some information that his
   father could be in a town, although he didnt know where exactly, and
   he rented a brand new car to go to the town, and the seat belt buckle
   was stuck. He spent some time trying to fix it and surprisingly he
   found a business card next to it on the floor of the car. It was a
   business card of a hotel/inn and he had a feeling he should go there.
   He went there and found that his father was buried on the ground of
   that inn. Wayne certainly used 'synchronicity' to define events that
   are linked, yet are not totally unrelated.
<p>   Harold Sherman the famous american ESP expert, uses the same term
   synchronicity as thoughts creating 'coincidence'. That 2 seemingly
   "unrelated" events (how do we know its unrelated? perhaps only on a
   conscious logical level we think its unrelated, but the subconscious
   may know more than that) could be a linked cause towards what a person
   is trying to create/achieve in his life. He wrote about a certain
   famous person (I forgot who it was), who desperately desired to get
   his hands on a particular newspaper articles on a certain date,
   certain newspaper about him. He thought about it with strong feeling
   for a few nights. Few days later, he was walking in downtown New York
   and out of the crowd, suddenly a person said to him "Mr.x, Mr.x, I
   have something to give you. I have been a big fan of yours, and I have
   been collecting newspaper articles about you for many years. THis
   morning, i just had this feeling I should give these to you, I was on
   my way to mail it to you, and I suddenly saw you! Here!" And in his
   hands were the exact newspaper article, among some others.
<p>   Even Richard Bandler, claimed he could use a strategy where, he can
   think of someone whom he wishes to be called on the telephone, and
   then the person would call most of the time. What I like about
   Bandler's approach is that he made it a precise strategy, with
   submodalities etc to make it work. I have used his strategy before,
   and his method DID make the experiment more effective. We are not
   talking about 100% result here everytime, you cannot take this and
   prove it in a scientific lab, because in the realm of mind, there are
   many variables influencing such things - a person's belief,
   expectation, correct or incorrect use of submodalities and strategy.
   Plus there is the time frame problem, how quickly must the
   'coincidence' take place, before we say it is just pure chance? We can
   only, like Bandler said "prove it to yourself or at least have an open
   mind to experiment with it".
<p>   I find that sometimes when I want to meet someone, it may take a few
   weeks before i run into them. Sometimes it takes just hours, if the
   person is in the same city as you are(!):) I believe that the
   unconscious always knows how to adjust the right suitable timing.
