<h>   Why We Hate Them

<p>   "Why do they hate us?" was a common refrain after
   Sept. 11; far less often heard was the converse question: Why do we
   hate them? Maybe that's because the answer is so obvious, but even so,
   a reminder every now and then doesn't do any harm. A group of radical
   Islamists in London are providing just such a reminder, holding a
   rally to celebrate--yes, celebrate--the atrocities their
   coreligionists committed a year ago. The poster nearby advertises the
   event with the slogan "September the 11th 2001: A towering day in
   history." Oh, those wacky Islamic punsters.

<p>   "The conference, which will be attended by the most radical mullahs in
   Britain, will argue that the atrocities were justified because Muslims
   must defend themselves against armed aggression," the London Daily
   Telegraph reports. Al-Muhajiroun, the sponsor, has a program for the
   confab on its Web site; it includes talks on "The positive outcomes of
   the 11th September 2001," "The US conspiracy against Islam and
   Muslims" and "The alliance of the US and Al-Saud [our friends the
   Saudis] in their attack against Muslims." The men behind the
   celebration say they're starting a new group called the Islamic
   Council of Britain, "funded by Saudi-based businessmen, which, if
   true, will embarrass Saudi Arabia," according to the Telegraph.

<p>   This is of course enraging, but it's also just plain weird. What kind
   of country, in the midst of a war, allows its mortal enemies to hold a
   hate-fest on its own soil? It's as if Nazi sympathizers were holding
   Nuremberg-style rallies in Britain and the U.S. in 1942. In most
   countries at most times in history, surely the Al-Muhajirounites would
   be rounded up and arrested, if not executed, for treason.

<p>   One might take a perverse pride that the Anglo-American tradition of
   freedom is so robust, and so fearless, that it allows even the most
   thuggish fanatics to speak their minds in public. Or one might argue
   that this is a case of tolerance gone mad. In any case, let's hope the
   conference is well attended by folks from Scotland Yard and MI5.

<h>   Baghdad Jane
<p>   Maybe the Cold War is a better analogy than World War II. During that
   conflict, there was a communist fringe in the U.S., and even more so
   elsewhere in the West, which, McCarthyism notwithstanding, generally
   was free to express its hatred for America. Everyone remembers how
   "Hanoi Jane" Fonda went to North Vietnam in 1972 to show solidarity
   with the enemy.

<p>   Call Scott Ritter "Baghdad Jane." The erstwhile U.N. weapons inspector
   was in the Iraqi capital yesterday, where he told Iraq's "parliament"
   as the BBC puts it, "that Iraq is not a threat to the outside world
   and that military action against the country would not be
   justifiable." Ritter did call on the Iraqis to let inspectors back in,
   but he also claimed Iraq has no weapons of mass destruction--though
   it's hard to see how he could know this, since no inspectors have been
   to Iraq in four years.

<h>   Saddam's Nuke Quest
<p>   "Iraq could assemble a nuclear weapon in months if it had foreign
   help," CNN reports, citing a new study by the International Institute
   for Strategic Studies. "The argument in favor of taking action now,
   whether it's to compel Baghdad to accept inspectors or to use military
   force to change the regime, is that it's better to act when [Iraq's]
   capabilities are still short of reaching their ultimate objective,"
   the report's author, Gary Samore, tells CNN.

<p>   The New York Times also reports that "Iraq has stepped up its quest
   for nuclear weapons and has embarked on a worldwide hunt for materials
   to make an atomic bomb":

<p>     In the last 14 months, Iraq has sought to buy thousands of
     specially designed aluminum tubes, which American officials believe
     were intended as components of centrifuges to enrich uranium.
     American officials said several efforts to arrange the shipment of
     the aluminum tubes were blocked or intercepted but declined to say,
     citing the sensitivity of the intelligence, where they came from or
     how they were stopped. . . .

<p>     The attempted purchases are not the only signs of a renewed Iraqi
     interest in acquiring nuclear arms. President Hussein has met
     repeatedly in recent months with Iraq's top nuclear scientists and,
     according to American intelligence, praised their efforts as part
     of his campaign against the West.

<p>     Iraqi defectors who once worked for the nuclear weapons
     establishment have told American officials that acquiring nuclear
     arms is again a top Iraqi priority.

<p>   The Scotsman has details on a dossier it says Prime Minister Tony
   Blair will soon issue on Saddam's efforts to acquire nukes. The
   Telegraph reports that "Tony Blair and President George W Bush have
   agreed to topple Saddam Hussein by military means even if the United
   Nations does not pass a Security Council resolution authorising the
   use of force." So much for complaints of U.S. "unilaterialism." Though
   the U.S. must be willing to act alone, there's ample evidence that
   President Bush is in the midst of assembling an international
   coalition:
   
<l>     * John Howard, prime minister of Australia, tells the Associated
       Press that he agrees with "Washington's position . . . that the
       United Nation's should play a greater role in resolving the
       problem with Iraq's alleged nuclear ambitions."

<l>     * "President Jacques Chirac of France proposed a two-stage plan
       today that could lead to United Nations authorization of military
       force against Iraq," the New York Times reports.

<l>     * Germany's Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder says he's unalterably
       opposed to toppling Saddam--but his challenger, Edmund Stoiber, is
       more flexible, and the election is less than two weeks off.

<l>     * Bush is meeting with Canada's Prime Minister Jean Chretien
       today--though Reuters quotes Chretien's deputy, John Manley, as
       saying the Canadians "haven't signed on to" Bush's plans for
       regime change.

<p>   Oddly, British and American opponents of overthrowing Saddam (with a
   few exceptions, such as Brent Scowcroft) have shied away from
   forthrightly making the case against intervention, instead professing
   their ignorance and calling on President Bush to "make the case"
   against Saddam. The Telegraph's Barbara Amiel is on to them:

<p>     These voices never floundered before. They have never let
     information alone stand in the way of telling Prime Ministers and
     Presidents what to do about the Cold War, the Gulf war, the Panama
     invasion, the Falklands, Global Warming, Poverty, Hunger and Dirt.

<p>     One suspects that they really want to put their collective heads in
     the sand or, less generously, side with a coalition of
     anti-Americans, muddled Marxists and confused admirers of Islamism
     all intent on seeing capitalism, Israel and America crippled. But
     as this agenda is not quite respectable, so it must be masked by a
     feigned thirst for knowledge.

<p>   And what about Arab opposition? "Syria is showing increasing signs of
   unease at Washington's plans to topple Saddam Hussein in neighboring
   Iraq, fearing it would be the first step in a wave of regime changes
   in the Middle East to suit US and Israeli interests," the Christian
   Science Monitor reports. (Such changes, of course, would also suit the
   interests of the people of the countries whose tyrannical regimes
   change.) The paper quotes Murhaf Jouejati, a Syrian specialist at
   Washington's Middle East Institute: "Damascus would not like to see
   the regime toppled and substituted by a pro-American regime because in
   that case Damascus would be totally surrounded by American power."

<h>   Is Osama Dead?
<p>   Al-Jazeera seems to think so. "A slip of the tongue by one of Osama
   bin Laden's top henchmen seems to have betrayed al-Qaeda's most potent
   secret: its charismatic leader is dead," the Times of London reports.
   In an interview with the Qatar-based satellite network, Khalid Sheikh
   Mohammed "referred to bin Laden, who has not been seen since the fall
   of Afghanistan's Taleban regime, in the past tense. The reporter Yosri
   Fouda, London bureau chief for al-Jazeera, concluded that bin Laden is
   now likely to be dead."

<p>   Mohammed also told Fouda that, in the Times' words, "the target of the
   fourth, thwarted hijack attack in Washington was Congress, not the
   White House; the original plan was to crash aircraft into atomic power
   stations; and the plotters used simple codes to keep in touch by
   internet."

<p>   In its report on the al Qaeda confession, Reuters declares, believe it
   or not, that "Washington has accused bin Laden and al Qaeda of being
   responsible for the attacks."

<h>   Reuters Outdoes Itself--II
<p>   As we noted, last week Reuters published a photo of the World Trade
   Center site with the following caption:

<p>     Recovery and debris removal work continues at the site of the World
     Trade Center known as "ground zero" in New York, March 25, 2002.
     Human rights around the world have been a casualty of the U.S. "war
     on terror" since September 11.

<p>   That photo has now disappeared from the Yahoo! archives, and the
   Washington Post's Howard Kurtz reports that Nancy Bobrowitz, the wire
   service's spokeswoman, "says the caption was a 'mistake' because the
   information, drawn from an accompanying story, was taken 'out of
   context.' " Well, here are the first two paragraphs of the
   accompanying story:

<p>     GENEVA (Reuters)--Human rights around the world have been a
     casualty of the U.S. "war on terror" since September 11.

<p>     In the year since Muslim extremists flew hijacked planes into New
     York and Washington, killing some 3,000 people, many Western
     governments have armed themselves with greater powers of arrest and
     curtailed the legal rights of detainees as they hunt for
     accomplices.

<p>   The dispatch is headlined "Rights the First Victim of 'War on
   Terror,' " and only in the third paragraph does reporter Richard
   Waddington attribute these opinions to "human rights
   activists"--hardly an unbiased source.

<h>   Not Too Brite--IV
<p>   "An Iranian man cut off his seven-year-old daughter's head after
   suspecting she had been raped by her uncle," Reuters reports, citing a
   report in an Iranian newspaper. " 'The motive behind the killing was
   to defend my honor, fame, and dignity,' the paper quoted the father as
   saying."

<p>   Reuters apparently thinks the murder of a seven-year-old girl is kind
   of cute; the story appears under the heading "Oddly Enough."

<h>   Great Moments in Law Enforcement
<p>   "The government mistakenly gave alleged terrorist Zacarias Moussaoui
   classified documents related to al Qaeda," ABC News reports. "The
   material--both on disk and as hard copy documents--was sent to
   Moussaoui as part of discovery for his legal defense, said several
   legal sources, including one at the Justice Department."

<p>   Meanwhile, the Associated Press reports that "German authorities had
   suspicions nearly two months ago about a Turkish man suspected of
   plotting to bomb U.S. military bases in Germany, but bureaucratic
   procedures delayed his arrest until last week":

<p>     A tip from U.S. security officials that a witness reported the
     suspect had chemicals at home reached German prosecutors in
     mid-July, but a judge put off questioning of the woman, scheduled
     for Aug. 13, because the summons could not be delivered on time,
     said Elke O'Donoghue, a prosecutor in the city of Stuttgart.

<p>   Prosecutors got a search warrant Aug. 30, and six days later they
   arrested Osman Petmezci and his American fiancÃ©e, Astrid Eyzaguirre.
   "Inside the couple's third-floor apartment, police found 287 pounds of
   bomb-making chemicals--which investigators said Sunday could have been
   used to make about 44 pounds of gunpowder--along with five pipe bombs,
   a book about bomb-making and electronic parts apparently intended as
   detonators." The cops say they don't think the couple were connected
   with al Qaeda.

<h>   Only Outlaws Will Have Suicide Bombs
<p>   "Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is to ask a key meeting of the
   Palestinian parliament on Monday to outlaw suicide bombing and to
   reaffirm the Palestinian commitment to peace with Israel," the
   Associated Press reported. But he ended up doing no such thing.
   Instead, as the New York Times reports, he "told Palestinian
   legislators today that he condemned acts of terror against Israeli and
   Palestinian civilians, and said he believed that peace with Israel was
   still possible. But he stopped short of calling for an end to all
   attacks against Israelis."

<p>   Even Arafat's condemnation of terror "against Israel civilians"
   doesn't amount to much, for the Palestinian Arabs don't regard anyone
   who's ever served in the Israeli Defense Forces (in a country with
   universal conscription) or who lives in the disputed territories as a
   "civilian."

<p>   Agence France-Presse, meanwhile, reports that the IDF found a
   "powerful bomb" in the offices of what AFP calls "Arafat's mainstream
   Fatah movement."

<p>   Arafat won a Nobel Peace Prize in 1994.

<p>   Ha'aretz reports that one of Arafat's cabinet members threatened that,
   in the paper's words, "the Palestinian Authority might reconsider its
   recognition of the State of Israel, in view of Prime Minister Ariel
   Sharon's declaration that all the signed agreements between the two
   sides are canceled." Oh, what a threat! Next thing you know the
   Palestinians will initiate some sort of hostilities or something.

<p>   Here's some good news from the Mideast. Time magazine reports that the
   terror group Hamas is in ruins. "Israeli intelligence officials tell
   TIME that since the start last spring of the West Bank offensive known
   as Operation Defensive Shield, 98% of the members of Hamas' military
   wing who are known to them in the area have been killed or arrested--a
   total of 70 men." Who says there's no military solution to terrorism?

<h>   A Real Martyr
<p>   Contrary to early reports, at least one of the men whom U.S. special
   forces troops shot and killed during an assassination attempt against
   Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai was not an assassin. The New York
   Times reports on how Azimullah Muhammad became "Afghanistan's newest
   hero":

<p>     On Friday, television viewers around the world watched BBC reports
     of a man in a brown tunic watching as an Afghan army guard turned
     his gun the wrong way -- against President Hamid Karzai and the
     Kandahar governor, Gul Agha Shirzai.

<p>     "Azimullah didn't hesitate a second, he just jumped on him when he
     saw him shooting," Khalil Pashtoon, the governor's press secretary,
     said today of the young man. . . .

<p>     In the scuffle, the soldier apparently shot the young man as they
     wrestled to the ground. Then, American Special Forces bodyguards
     apparently shot them both dead.

<h>   Next: O.J. Simpson Lectures Us on Nonviolence
<p>   Former tennis star John McEnroe weighs in with an op-ed in the Daily
   Telegraph, and we swear we're not making this up:

<p>     In travelling the world as a tennis player, I have a better
     appreciation of other countries than most Americans. We could do
     with being a little less besotted with money, money, money, win,
     win, win. When I am in England each summer people always ask: "Why
     don't English players win Wimbledon? They ought to be more like
     Americans and play to win." To my mind, it's time Americans started
     being more like the English--or at least learnt to lose with grace.

<h>   Those Skeptics Will Believe Anything
<p>   Tom Brazaitis of the Cleveland Plain Dealer reports on an article in
   Skeptical Inquirer (the piece itself isn't online) that says terrorism
   is no big deal:

<p>     The authors, research scientists Clark Chapman and Alan Harris, say
     that the disproportionate reaction to Sept. 11 has been as damaging
     as the destruction of lives and property on that day.

<p>     "An objective of terrorism is to multiply damage by inducing
     irrational fears in the broad population," they write. "One defense
     is to learn to evaluate such situations more objectively." . . .

<p>     "Every month, including September 2001, the U.S. highway death toll
     exceeds fatalities in the World Trade Center, Pentagon and four
     downed airliners combined," they write.

<p>   Don't you feel better now?

<h>   You Probably Think This Screed Is About You
<p>   Matt Drudge picks up a Sunday Times of London op-ed by Norman Mailer
   (the Times' Sunday edition is no longer available online without a
   steep subscription fee) in which the author says America is "so vain":

<p>     Culturally, emotionally America is growing more loutish, arrogant,
     and vain. I detest this totally promiscuous patriotism. Wave a
     little flag and become a good person? Ugly. If we have a depression
     or fall into desperate economic times, I don't know what's going to
     hold the country together. . . .

<p>     There's just too much anger here, too much ruptured vanity, too
     much shock, too much identity crisis. And worst of all, too much
     patriotism. Patriotism in a country that's failing has a logical
     tendency to turn fascistic.

<h>   Freudian Slip
<p>   Bill Clinton called on the U.S. to "flush out" al Qaeda, not "flesh
   out," as the Associated Press quoted him. We repeated the error
   Friday.

<h>   The Grass Is Always Greener on the Other Side
<p>   "U.S. politicians have expressed unhappiness with the idea of Canada
   in any way easing its stance on marijuana and some say if Ottawa did
   relax its rules, this could lead to a clampdown on the countries' long
   joint frontier," Reuters reports.

<h>   Homelessness Rediscovery Watch

<p>     "If George W. Bush becomes president, the armies of the homeless,
     hundreds of thousands strong, will once again be used to illustrate
     the opposition's arguments about welfare, the economy, and
     taxation."--Mark Helprin, Oct. 31, 2000

<p>     "The 'Homeless in Paradise' Inhabit Beach Cities in Growing
     Numbers"--headline, Los Angeles Times, Sept. 8, 2002

<h>   No Man's Land
<p>   "India's first eunuch mayor has been unseated in a legal dispute over
   whether she is a man or a woman," the Washington Times reports:

<p>     As all Indian eunuchs do, Kamla Jaan dresses as a woman and
     believes she is a female. But a judge in the central state of
     Madhya Pradesh ruled last week that Kamla Jaan is, in fact, a man
     and should be disqualified from the mayoral post, which is reserved
     under a quota system for a female candidate. . . .

<p>     Kamla Jaan, who is illiterate, argued that she was a "born
     eunuch"--an authentic eunuch is a castrated male--and so should not
     be considered a man. But in his 40-page ruling, the judge agreed
     with the group of petitioners that Kamla Jaan is male.

<p>   The Times quotes P. Manorama, a physician who works with eunuchs, as
   saying that "roughly estimated, one in a hundred eunuchs is a natural
   eunuch or hermaphrodite born with deformed or ambiguous
   genitalia--neither a boy nor a girl." That means the other 99 are all
   castrated. Which leads us to wonder: Why do press reports treat this
   as a quaint feature of Indian culture, when it seems every bit as
   barbaric as the African and Muslim practice of female genital
   mutilation?

<h>   You Don't Say
<p>   "HP Researchers Make Tiny Memory From Molecules"--headline, Reuters,
   Sept. 9

<p>   Of course, lots of big things, including trucks and skyscrapers, are
   also made of molecules.

<h>   It's the Eponymy, Stupid
<p>   A woman in Arlington, Wash., was driving her pickup truck when a
   red-tailed hawk collided with it. "after she freed the bird's wing
   from the side-view mirror, the hawk invaded the truck, bit [the
   woman's] lip and then sank its talons into her right arm," the
   Associated Press reports. She drove to a gas station and shouted:
   "Call 911! I have a hawk stuck to my arm."

<p>   The woman's name is Jamie Wing.

<h>   'My Public Spirit Stops at My Daughter'
<p>   In a letter to the editor of the Washington Post, one April Falcon
   Doss explains why she chose to send her daughter to a private school:

<p>     For a card-carrying liberal, I was surprisingly unapologetic about
     our decision. Why should I sacrifice our daughter's future to an
     abstract principle? I wasn't up to battling the school system about
     class size, curriculum and extracurricular activities. And by the
     time any changes could be made, our daughter would have already
     missed out on a vibrant education

<p>   Here in a nutshell is the definition of an American liberal: one who
   is willing to sacrifice the future of other people's children to an
   abstract principle.
