<h>   Mountains and Hills

<p>   Between the Korean peninsula and Manchuria flow, in opposite
   directions, the two largest rivers of the region, the Amnokgang (Yalu)
   and Duman-gang (Tumen), both originating at Mt. Baekdusan (2,744
   meters), the highest mountain in the region. The peninsula is
   surrounded by the Yellow Sea, the East Sea and the South Sea.
   
<p>   Nearly 70 percent of the Korean Peninsula is covered by mountains and
   hills. Low hills in the southern and the western regions give way
   gradually to increasingly higher mountains toward the eastern and the
   northern areas. On the whole, the western and southern slopes of the
   peninsula are wide with some plains and basins along rivers, while the
   eastern slope is very steep as high mountains precipitate into the
   East Sea.
   
<p>   Most of the high mountains are located along the Taebaek mountain
   range which runs parallel to the east coast, roughly north-to-south.
   West of this range are the drainage basins of the Han-gang and
   Geumgang rivers. This range extends to the Nangnim range in North
   Korea, forming the geological and geomorphological backbone of the
   peninsula and constituting the watershed between the western and
   eastern slopes of the peninsula. Mt. Nangnimsan (2,014m), Mt.
   Geumgangsan (1,638m), Mt. Seoraksan (1,708m), and Mt. Taebaeksan
   (1,567m) are some of the highest peaks along these ranges. Just
   southwest from the Taebaek range is the Sobaek range, which culminates
   in the massive Mt. Jirisan (1,915m). This range was historically a
   great barrier between the central and southern parts of the peninsula,
   and also between the eastern and western regions in the south. The
   Nakdonggang river basin is thus segregated in southeastern Korea. The
   Gaemagowon Plateau, the so-called "Roof of Korea," located in the
   northwestern corner of the peninsula, has an average elevation of
   about 1,500 meters above sea level.
   
<p>   The landmass of the peninsula is rather stable geologically in spite
   of its proximity to Japan; it has neither active volcanoes nor strong
   earthquakes. There are, however, a few dead volcanoes that were formed
   during the Pleistocene era. Mt. Baekdusan is famous for a large
   caldera lake, "Cheonji," meaning heavenly tarn. Mt. Hallasan in Jejudo
   island, the highest mountain in South Korea, was recorded to have had
   minor volcanic activity in the early 11th century. It has a small
   crater lake, "Baengnokdam," and there are about 400 parasitic cones in
   its piedmont.
   
<p>   About two-thirds of the Korean Peninsula is composed of pre-Cambrian
   metamorphic and granitic rock. Although the distribution of
   sedimentary rock is very limited, limestone is quite abundant in some
   regions and a number of limestone caves can be found, some of which
   are tourist attractions. Among the most famous caves are Gossigul,
   Gosugul and Seongnyugul, all of which are adorned with stalagmites and
   stalactites.
   
<h>   Rivers and Plains

<p>   Most of major rivers flow into the Yellow Sea and a few into the South
   Sea, draining the western and southern slopes of the peninsula.
   Considering its size, Korea has a relatively large number of long
   rivers, six of them exceeding 400 kilometers. The discharge of rivers
   fluctuates very much due to the summer monsoon. In the summertime,
   rivers swell with heavy rainfall, flooding valley plains every once in
   a while. In drier seasons, the water level drops and often much of the
   river bed is exposed. Typhoons, which hit the southern part of the
   peninsula once every two or three years, also bring heavy rainfall in
   late summer and early autumn.
   
<p>   In the past, rivers were important for transportation. Historical
   capitals such as Pyongyang and Buyeo are located adjacent to major
   rivers, as is Seoul. After the introduction of railroads and
   automobiles, however, the importance of rivers for transportation has
   decreased sharply, and rivers are now used mainly for the irrigation
   of rice fields and power generation. During the last two decades a
   number of huge dams have been constructed for flood control,
   electricity, and irrigation. But these dams have gradually begun to
   play a major role as reservoirs for piped water supply to large cities
   and industrial plants as a result of rapid urbanization and
   industrialization nationwide.
   
<p>   Most farming fields are narrow floodplains developed along rivers,
   especially in their lower reaches. These plains serve as the major
   rice-producing lands. Large tidal differences at the mouths of major
   rivers flowing into the Yellow Sea inhibited the development of
   deltaic plains, although rivers transport large amounts of sediment
   during floods. Only the Nakdonggang river flowing into the South Sea
   has a small delta at its mouth. Erosional basins along rivers in areas
   of granitic rocks have also served as agricultural regions since
   ancient times. Many large cities such as Chuncheon, Cheongju and Wonju
   are located in such basins.
   
<h>   Coasts

<p>   Korea has a long coastline divided into the east, west and south
   coasts. The east coast has small tidal differences, a third of one
   meter at the most, and a relatively smooth shoreline with few islands
   offshore. The Taebaek range runs closely along the East Sea. Where
   mountains protrude from the Taebaek range, coasts are rocky in
   general, but some beaches are found in places into which small streams
   carry sediment from the high mountains. In many instances, the beaches
   take the form of sand spits and bars enclosing lagoons, which are
   notable features of the east coast. Along the coast between Wonsan and
   Gangneung are located a series of lagoons, including Gyeongpo and
   Hwajinpo, two famous resorts. The highway connecting Gang-neung and
   Seoul has been expanded recently, reducing the travel time between the
   central region and the east coast.
   
<p>   The shorelines of the south and west coasts are very irregular with
   innumerable small peninsulas and bays as well as a large number of
   islands. The west coast facing the Yellow Sea, which is very shallow,
   has large tidal ranges, which rise above 10 meters in places. Harbors
   have been difficult to develop while tidal flats are common coastal
   features especially in bays into which rivers discharge sediment
   during floods. Tidal flats have been reclaimed from ancient times
   mainly for rice fields, but since the 1970s, the reclamation grew in
   terms of magnitude. The Saeman-geum Project, the largest such project
   ever undertaken, seeks to reclaim a total of 40,100 hectares of the
   flats through the construction of huge dikes, but it faces strong
   opposition from environmental groups.
   
<p>   The south coast shows a typical ria shoreline, a coastal zone which
   has been submerged. The length of coastline is nearly eight times
   longer than its straight-line distance, and its indentation is far
   greater than that of the west coast. The tidal ranges are relatively
   small at two to five meters, and tidal flats are not as wide as along
   the west coast. Although mountains face the sea, there are few beaches
   and sea cliffs along the mainland coast, as innumerable islands
   prevent the penetration of waves from offshore. Narrow straits between
   the mainland and islands are associated with extremely rapid tidal
   currents. At Uldolmok toward the western end of the south coast, the
   tidal current reaches up to 13 knots.
