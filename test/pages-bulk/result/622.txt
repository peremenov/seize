<h>                            Welcome to Oswestry


<p> Oswestry is an ancient market town located in the North
   of Shropshire close by the English - Welsh Border. Its strategic
   position as a 'frontier town' has given it a turbulent history. Today
   the town still retains its vital function as a market and shopping
   centre serving North West Shropshire and Mid Wales. The narrow
   passageways link streets whose names conjure up images of the past:
   English Walls, Welsh Walls, The Bailey and the Horsemarket. It is a
   locally important shopping and agricultural centre and still retains
   the intimacy of a rural town serving local people and home to a number
   of specialist and independent shops.
   
<p>   The origins of the town are uncertain although the towns market dates
   back to 1190. The name Oswestry is thought to be a corruption of
   'Oswald's Tree' and the legend that Oswald the Christian King of
   Northumbria fought a great battle against the pagan King of Mercia -
   Penda. Oswald was defeated and killed in the battle. Penda - as a
   warning to others who might challenge his rule - dismembered Oswald's
   body and hung his limbs on the branches of a tree - hence the name
   'Oswalds Tree'.
   
<p>   Oswestry's first school founded in 1407 is now a Heritage centre and
   holds regular exhibitions of local arts and crafts. The town Tourist
   Information Centre can be found in the same building.
   
<p>   Most of the town centre has been designated a Conservation Area
   conveying a mixture of architectural styles. There are many old timber
   framed houses, for example Llywd Mansion on Cross Street, the Heritage
   Centre, the Blackgate, the Fox Inn and the shops along Beatrice
   Street. Georgian architecture is also represented particularly around
   St Oswald's Church where there are a number of imposing town houses
   complete with grand entrance staircases and front doors.
   
<p>   It has a significant Victorian legacy. Many of the Shop fronts and
   facades, the many terraced houses and churches and railway buildings
   reflect this period.
   
<p>   Oswestry, has a troubled past and was once encircled by town walls
   which is shown on the medieval street plan of a walled town. The
   Oswestry Town Trail leaflet is available from the Heritage Centre and
   the Tourist Information Centre at Mile End and can be used to tour the
   town's many sites of historical interest for example: St Oswald's
   Church. Cae Glas Park, the town's old gates and Castle Bank are just a
   few of the places of interest.
   
<h>   History and Town Records
<p>   Few records survive from before 1674, the year of the charter granted
   to the Town by King Charles II, some deeds, charters, accounts and
   memoranda of the Bailiffs do exist but little else.
   
<p>   From 1674 to 1835 records are plentiful, consisting of minutes of the
   Council, accounts of the Mayor, proceedings of the Quarter Sessions
   and Court of Record, and correspondence and papers relating to the
   business of the Guildhall, the gaol, markets and fairs, and other
   matters of Local Interest.
   
<p>   Post 1835 Oswestry saw was a period of great development. In the late
   1840's new Markets were built in the late 1840's and the construction
   of reservoirs followed from the late 1860's to the late 1880's. The
   events were well recorded in the minutes of the Council and its
   committees and numerous bundles of deeds and documents on all and
   sometimes trivial aspects of the administration of Town affairs.
   
<h>   The Castle
   
<p>   Dating to around 1086, the castle L'oeuvre was recorded in William I's
   Domesday Book as being built by Rainald, Sheriff of Shropshire in the
   Hundred of Meresberie, it was once a frontier outpost that saw both
   Welsh and Anglo Saxon mix together prior to the Norman conquest.
   
<p>   The earliest reference to the town was recorded 1272 and the
   settlement of Blancminster, which derives from its white stone church.
   The Welsh refer to a `Creos Oswallt' in 1254, and an obvious link with
   St. Oswald, the Northumbrian King who was killed at the nearby Battle
   of Maeserfelth in 641 AD. Regardless, it is generally accepted that
   Oswestry was once a strong Welsh settlement and the Castle had a role
   of domination to subdue Welsh resistance.
   
<p>   Following the conquest, the region was granted to Roger de Montgomerie
   by William I. This passed to Rainald who is attributed as having built
   the first castle. Then came Alan Fitzlaad, descendant to the mighty
   Fitzalans and later to become the Lords of Arundel and Clun.
   
<p>   The Civil War between Stephen and Matilda saw William Fitzalan I join
   forces with Matilda and he was forced to give up the castle and its
   area. The Welsh appear to have taken this chance to reclaim what they
   once lost and the occupation of the castle by Madoc ap Maerdudd the
   Prince of Powys, between 1149 and 1157, along with the Lordship of the
   area followed.
   
<p>   The accession of Henry II saw the Fitzalan's recover their estate, but
   they failed to establish a peaceful reign and troubled times followed.
   There was significant conflict between the Welsh and the English,
   which saw the area and its castle sacked numerous times. In 1165,
   Henry II adopted it as a base for his campaign against Owain Gwynned
   and in 1211, it was used by King John in his war against Llewlyn Fawr.
   
<p>   By 1270 the castle's walls embraced the town. In the 14th Century one
   Owain Glyndwr attempted to establish himself as the rightful Prince of
   Wales and throughout this period the town became recognised as a
   strategic trading point. For example, the Short Charter granted by
   William III at the end of the 12th Century awarded the area similar
   customs and liberties as the larger and already prosperous Shrewsbury.
   
<p>   A second charter in 1263 followed and in 1399 it received a Royal
   Charter. Despite this, it remained a fully fortified military base and
   this function continued for many years.
   
<p>   The outbreak of the Civil War in 1642 revived its status as a military
   stronghold and it was once more strengthened to some degree, following
   the town's declaration of support for Charles I, and prepared for
   hostility. In June 1644 the castle was under the control of Colonel
   Edward Lloyd of Llanforda. It was laid to siege by Thomas Mytton of
   Halston Hall (near Whittington) who was soon joined by the earl of
   Denbigh. The town gates were battered into submission by cannon and
   infiltrated by troops who rapidly descended upon the castle,
   surrounding. The following day, `Buttars,' a kind of early grenade,
   were used to storm the gates and the royalist troops surrendered.
   
<p>   Following the Civil War, Oswestry Castle were rendered uninhabitable
   as part of a campaign to quash further resistance and it was reduced
   to a simple collection of stones.
   
<h>   Other Places of Interest
   
<h>   The Old Grammer School

<p>   A 15th Century, Grade II listed timber-framed property. Originally the
   Oswestry Grammar School, founded by David Holbache in 1407, the
   building occupies a prominent position on the boundary of the
   churchyard of St. Oswald. Now the property of Oswestry Town Council
   and opened in 1992, the Centre contains civic and local items of
   interest reflecting the long established and magnificent Heritage of
   Oswestry.
   
<h>   Iron Age Fort

<p>   There is a large Iron Age fort just to the North of the town. It was
   started over 2500 years ago. Nowadays, only the Earthworks remain, but

   town. It is maintained by English Heritage

   dyke built by the Saxon King Offa.
