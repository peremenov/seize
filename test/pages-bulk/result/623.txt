<h>     Introduction

<h>     Topic: Penguins

<p>     What can we learn about penguins through research, experimentation,
     observation, design projects and problem solving?

<p>     The following unit provides 5 detailed learning experiences and a
     list of additional activities that explore the life cycle and
     habitat of a variety of penguins. This unit was designed for second
     grade but can be easily modified for any elementary level class.
     The unit took approximately 5 to 6 weeks to cover. Although all
     areas of the curriculum were involved, the focus was on math,
     science and technology. The culmination of this unit was a special
     "Penguin Program". Parents and special guests were invited to see a
     production, which involved songs, poems, a readers theater and a
     geography presentation involving Beanie Babies. I then presented a
     Power Point Program which allowed the guests to see an outline of
     the unit and pictures of the various activities and experiments
     that the students had taken part in.

    ___________________________________________________________________

<h>     Learning Experience #1
<h>     Title: "How Do Penguins Measure Up?"


<h>     Learning Context:

<h>     NYS Standards:

<l>     MST Standard #2- Information Systems

<l>     MST Standard #3- Mathematics

<l>     ELA Standard #1- Language for Information and Understanding

<l>     Social Studies Standard #3- Geography

<h> Objectives:

<l>     The students will research a particular penguin species to find out
   its average height as well as three other facts about that penguin.

<l>     The students will use a variety of tools to measure the height of
   their penguin on paper and then draw and color a picture of that
   penguin showing its characteristics.

<l>     The students will then use the information that they have gathered
   to create a graph that shows the height of the penguin species. They
   will also answer questions based on that graph.
   
<p>     In order for the students to succeed with this learning experience they must enter into
   it with some prior knowledge. The students should show some competency
   with the following skills:

<l>     Differentiating between a fact and an opinion

<l>     Measuring, using an inch or centimeter ruler, yardstick or tape
   measure

<l>     Interpreting information using a bar graph or pictograph

<h>   Procedure:

<l>     Match students up with a partner. Assign a specific species to each
   pair, or let them draw a name of the species from a hat.

<l>     Distribute books or photocopies to each pair so that they can
   research their penguin (see appendix for references). If you have a
   computer lab, and appropriate software is available, try researching
   the species through the use of technology.

<l>     Supply each pair with a long sheet of butcher block, or similar
   paper.

<l>     Give each pair of students a checklist (see attached), so that they
   know exactly what criteria must be met in order to have an acceptable
   project.

<l>     Poll the students to find out the height of their species. List this
   information on chart paper. Then, supply the students with graph paper
   so that they can transfer this information into graph form. The
   students then create questions that can be answered by using the
   graph.

<h>   Instructional/Environmental Modifications:

<p>     In order to meet the needs of a hearing impaired student in my
     class, I always wear a Phonic Ear Device. This helps the student
     filter out background noise and concentrate more on my voice. When
     the students broke up into their groups I then attached the Phonic
     Ear Device to the childs partner so that they could communicate
     better. For a visually impaired student other modifications should
     be considered. The writing paper the students use to record their
     facts may need to be enlarged and the middle, dotted line can be
     highlighted in yellow.

<p>     I also found that it was necessary to alter the physical setting of
     my classroom. We pushed back the students' desks to make a large,
     open floor space. This allowed the students to spread out their
     papers and measure and draw more comfortably. I also allowed a
     different group to work out in the hall each day.

<h>   Time Required:

<p>     Prior to beginning this learning experience, I spent about an hour
     in the school and local public library collecting appropriate
     childrens books and magazines on penguins. I allotted a 45-minute
     period each day for one week for the children to complete and
     report on this experience. I was able to assess the students' work
     each day by making observations and keeping notes. I also assessed
     their final project when they made their presentations on the fifth
     day.

<h>   Resources:

<l>     Various reference books on penguins, crayons or markers

<l>     Software for referencing, writing paper, pencils

<l>     Butcher block paper

<l>     Various measuring tools (inch and centimeter rulers, yardsticks, or
     measuring tapes)

<h>   Assessment Plan:

<p>     At the beginning of this experience the students were given a
     checklist (please see attached) to use as a guide. The list helped
     them to keep track of all the steps they had to complete to have an
     acceptable project. The students were also given the opportunity to
     critique each others work. After each group presented their final
     project the other students described what they liked best about the
     project and/or made suggestions on how to make the project "even
     better". Some groups opted to put these suggestions to use while
     others did not.

<p>     While the students worked in their groups each day, I went around
     and made observations and kept notes on how the students interacted
     with one another. I also made assessments when the groups made
     their final presentations.

<h>   Student Work: (Please See Attached)


<h>   Reflection:

<p>   I chose to develop this learning experience because it integrated many
   curriculum areas and provided the students with the opportunity to
   work together, cooperatively, in small groups. The students really
   enjoyed this experience and looked forward to working on it everyday.
   I found the use of a checklist to be beneficial and will incorporate
   it into more lessons in the future.

<h>   Learning Experience #2
<h>   Title: "How Cold Is It?"


<h>   Learning Context:

<h>   NYS Standards:

<l>     MST Standard #2- Information Systems

<l>     MST Standard #3- Mathematics

<l>     MST Standard #4- Science

<l>     MST Standard #6- Interconnectedness: Common Themes

<h> Objectives:

<l>     The students will use the Internet to look up various weather sites
   and choose the most appropriate one.

<l>     The students will successfully navigate through a web site using
   links to obtain specific information.

<l>     The students will learn how to bookmark and retrieve a particular
   site.

<l>     The students will locate and record the temperature of a given area
   and then compare that temperature with the temperature of another area
   to determine which is warmer or colder.

<l>     The students will color a thermometer to match the recorded
   temperature.
   
<p>     In order for the students to succeed in this learning
   experience they must have some prior knowledge. They must show some
   competency with the following skills:

<l>     Telling temperature to the nearest degree (Celsius or Fahrenheit)

<l>     Understanding of negative temperature readings

<l>     Locating different regions on a map and understanding that these
   regions have different climates

<h>     Procedure:

<l>     Present the class with a whole group lesson on how to use the
   Internet to locate a specific web site and then determine if it
   provides the necessary information. Guide the class through the
   process of bookmarking the site.

<l>     Pair up the students. Whenever an opportunity arises (we did this
   first thing in the morning) allow the partners to access the web site
   and record the temperature for their town, as well as the temperature
   in an area of Antarctica (we used Vostok). The information can be
   recorded on the attached sheet.

<l>     The students must then compare the two recorded temperatures and
   determine which area is experiencing colder weather. This is also
   recorded on the data sheet.

<l>     Finally, the students will color in a thermometer to visually
   display the temperature.

<h>     Instructional/Environmental Modifications:

<p>   In order to do a whole group lesson on using the Internet, I took my
   class to the computer lab so that each student could have a computer
   in front of him/her. If you have access to the Internet through a
   computer in the classroom, then that computer could be used along with
   a LCD or video projector.

<p>   The hearing impaired student in my class had no problems with this
   lesson since use of the computer headphones was not required. For
   visually impaired students, the teacher may want to consider the use
   of transparent, colored, highlighter tape. This tape can be placed
   directly on the monitor screen to highlight the information the
   students are locating.

<h>   Time Required:

<p>   This learning experience was implemented with the help of a student
   teacher who was a great deal more computer literate than I was at the
   time. She spent about an hour locating weather web sites and scanning
   through them to see which one would provide us with the appropriate
   information. She then spent about a half an hour teaching me how to
   get into the web sites and how to bookmark them.

<p>   This experience took about two weeks to finish. Each morning my
   student teacher took two children to the classroom next door to access
   the web sites, and record the information. They then returned to our
   room to make comparisons, color in the thermometers, and discuss what
   they had learned. In all, it required about 15-20 minutes. I led the
   rest of the class through the morning opening exercises at the same
   time. After each child had a turn working on the computer and
   recording data, we discussed our findings in a whole group lesson. We
   spent a 45- minute period posting the information on a bulletin board
   and drawing conclusions based on our data.

<h>   Resources:

<l>   A Computer with an Internet connection and a Printer

<l>   Data recording Sheet (see attached)

<l>   Temperature Recording Sheet (see attached)

<l>   Red crayon or marker

<l>   Pencils

<h>   Assessment Plan:

<p>   The teachers made observations each day when working with a pair of
   students on the computer. A rubric (see attached) was then used to
   determine the students' level of competency. The students math skills
   were assessed by the success they had with the temperature recording
   sheets they filled in. The two recording sheets should be compared to
   make sure that the information coincides. Small group discussions also
   enable the teacher to assess the students ability to draw conclusions
   based on the information they had discovered.

<h>   Student Work: Please see attached.

<h>   Reflection:

<p>   Although I was very pleased with the students performances during this
   learning experience, I must admit I was a little hesitant at the
   beginning due to a lack of "computer knowledge" on my part. I was
   forced to learn some new skills for which I am now very grateful.

<p>   I dont think it would be possible to carry out this learning
   experience unless you have another adult in the room, whether its a
   teachers aide, student teacher or a parent volunteer. I think its very
   important to work in small groups and you must have someone by the
   computer at all times to make sure the students are accessing the
   information correctly.

<h>   Learning Experience #3
<h>   Title: "Solving Penguin Problems"


<h>   Learning Context:

<h>   NYS Standard:

<l>     MST Standard #3- Mathematics

<l>     ELA Standard #1- Language for Information and Understanding

<l>     ELA Standard #3 - Language for Critical Analysis and Evaluation
   
<h>   Objectives:

<l>     The students will solve math word problems by using a storyboard and
   "goldfish" manipulatives.

<l>     The students will create and solve their own word problems as well
   as design their own storyboard that reflects the problem.

<l>     The students will practice keyboarding by typing their word problems
   on the computer. Upon beginning this learning experience, it is
   helpful, but not necessary, for the students to know how to properly
   handle manipulatives. Rules should be established and "free play" time
   should be given so that the students can explore the manipulatives
   before they are asked to use them as a problem solving strategy.


<h>   Procedure:

<l>     * Distribute storyboards (see attached) so the students can color
       and personalize them.
<l>     * Distribute a bag of Pepperidge Farm Goldfish to each student and
       allow time to explore and play.
<l>     * Use the overhead projector to display a copy of the storyboard on
       a large screen. Present the students with a word problem that they
       can solve by using the goldfish as manipulatives.
<l>     * Model the process on the overhead.
<l>     * As the students get more comfortable with this problem solving
       strategy, increase the level of difficulty of the word problems
<l>     * After discussing the strategies used for problem solving, pass out
       writing paper and challenge the students to come up with their own
       word problems. You may wish to post the problems you solved
       together as models for the students to refer to. Depending on
       their ability level, some students may copy the problem and only
       change the numbers; others will create their own problems.
<l>     * Conference with the students and edit the problems as needed.
       Then, allow the students the opportunity to type their word
       problem on the computer and print it.
<l>     * Finally, distribute a variety of construction paper, scissors and
       glue and have the students design their own storyboard that
       illustrates the word problem that they created.
<l>     * When all the storyboards and word problems are complete, post them
       in the hall or on a bulletin board. Give the students an
       opportunity to choose a classmates problem and solve it in their
       math journals. The students should also include a journal entry
       describing why they chose that particular problem.

<h>   Instructional/Environmental Modifications:

<p>     It was necessary for me to use a Phonic Ear Device so that a
     hearing impaired student could participate in the learning
     experience.

<p>     Once the students began work on their own projects, I separated
     them into groups according to their math skills and their ability
     to work independently.

<h>   Time Required:

<p>     This learning experience took several days to implement. I used two
     45-minute periods to introduce and practice problem solving through
     the use of manipulatives and storyboards. Once the students were
     comfortable with this skill we spent the next 4 days (45-minutes to
     an hour) writing problems, creating storyboards and printing the
     problems on the computer. Since the assessment was on going, I did
     not have to allot extra time for reviewing student work.

<h>   Resources:

<l>     Penguin storyboards for each student

<l>     Overheard copy of the storyboard

<l>     One bag (about 20) of Pepperidge Farm Goldfish per student

<l>     Writing paper

<l>     Pencils

<l>     Crayons or markers

<l>     Scissors

<l>     Glue

<l>     Construction paper


<h>   Assessment Plan:

<p>     For the most part, assessments were made during whole group and
     small group instruction. The students' demonstrated the level of
     difficulty they were comfortable with as they began to create their
     own word problems. Observations were made and notes were taken
     during conferencing times in which the students explained what
     problem they created and how they got the answer. Some students
     needed more coaching then others, but everyone had an acceptable
     storyboard by the end of the learning experience.

<h>   Student Work: Please see attached.

<h>   Reflection:

<p>   Although we all enjoyed this learning experience, I think the
   students, in particular, found it rewarding. Their pride was very
   evident when all their work was displayed in the hall. They were
   extremely excited to find that older students were looking at their
   work and trying to solve the problems. I had tried a similar lesson
   earlier in the year but found that it was a little too difficult for
   the majority of my students. I was very pleased to see that they had
   progressed a great deal with their problem solving skills.

   ______________________________________________________________________

<h>   Learning Experience #4
<h>   Title: "Antarctic Adaptable Animals"


<h>   Learning Context:

<h>   NYS Standards:

<l>     MST Standard #4- Science

<l>     MST Standard #5- Technology

<l>     ELA Standard #1- Language for Information and Understanding

<l>     ELA Standard #4- Language for Social Interaction

<h> Objectives:

<l>     * The students will collect data and facts and use newly learned
       concepts to create a creature, which could survive life in
       Antarctica.
<l>     * The students will make informed and intelligent choices in
       choosing the materials needed to create a model of this creature.

<h>   Procedure:

<l>     Create a Venn Diagram with the students that compare whales and
   Emperor penguins. Discuss what similarities they share and the
   characteristics that enable them to survive in their environments.

<l>     Distribute the attached worksheet and give the students the
   opportunity to brainstorm about the new concepts that they have
   discovered about penguins and other Antarctic creatures.

<l>     Display a variety of materials (see materials list for ideas) on a
   worktable. Encourage students to give other suggestions as well.

<l>     Allow students to work individually or in pairs to create their
   Antarctic Adaptable Creature.

<l>     Finally, provide the students with the opportunity to introduce the
   creature to the class and describe what features it has that would
   enable it to live in Antarctica.

<h>   Instructional/Environmental Modifications:

<p>   For visually impaired students, the teacher may wish to enlarge the
   Venn diagram and questionnaire. It may also be helpful to print these
   pages on contrasting paper. I used a Phonic Ear Device during whole
   group instruction to meet the needs of a hearing impaired student.

<p>   I found it necessary to reconfigure the furniture in my classroom for
   this learning experience. I used one large table in the back of the
   room to hold all the craft materials the students used for creating
   their creatures. The students spread newspaper over their desks since
   they were using clay. I used a small table in the front of the room to
   conference with the students. Here, we discussed the answers to their
   questionnaires before they began creating with materials.

<h>   Time Required:

<p>   Prior to beginning this learning experience, I took 2 days to
   inventory my craft supplies and then spent an afternoon at Wal-Mart
   stocking up on some necessary items.

<p>   We spent a 45-minute period completing and discussing the Venn
   diagram. The next day, the students used their "Independent Work"
   period to complete their questionnaire and drawing. After sharing
   their ideas with their classmates (a 45-minute session) the students
   made some alterations to their design projects. Finally, we spent
   about 45-minutes to an hour actually creating the creatures with craft
   materials.

<p>   If some students finished early they were directed to make a mate or
   baby for their creature.

<h>   Resources:

<l>     Venn Diagram worksheet (see attached)

<l>     Design Worksheet (see attached)

<l>     Craft materials modeling clay (assorted colors), pipe cleaners,
     googly eyes, toothpicks, feathers, etc.

<l>     Assorted boxes to create dioramas for the creatures

<h>   Assessment Plan:

<p>     I found that with this technology/design project I used a more
     informal assessment plan. By looking at their questionnaires and
     discussing their responses at conference time I was able to
     determine how much information the students understood and were
     able to apply to this design project. The final product was also a
     good indicator of their level of understanding.

<h>   Student Work: Not Available

<h>   Reflection:

<p>   Although I have done similar lessons, this was my first attempt at a
   formal technology/design project. I was gratified to see that the
   students were extremely creative and gave their projects a great deal
   of thought. I was surprised that some students did not want to alter
   their "Antarctic Adaptable Animal" even though others had pointed out
   some flaws in their design. For example, one student chose to use pink
   feathers and another student informed her that pink would not be a
   good color to use for camouflage in Antarctica. The student said that
   she didnt care, she liked pink!

<p>   Some students got so caught up in this experience that they took it a
   step further and wrote puppet shows for their creatures.

   ______________________________________________________________________

<h>   Learning Experience #5
<h>   Title: The Blubber Glove


<h>   Learning Context:

<h>   NYS Standards:

<l>     MST Standard #1- Analysis, Inquiry, and Design

<l>     MST Standard #4- Science

<h> Objectives:

<l>     * The students will explore the uses of blubber and explain its
       purpose for a penguin.
<l>     * The students will successfully follow directions to perform an
       experiment.
<l>     * The students will make predictions based on prior knowledge.

<p>   It is not necessary for the students to have any specific prior
   knowledge in order for this learning experience to be successful. If
   you incorporate cooperative learning groups into the experience be
   sure that each student knows what he/she is responsible for.


<h>   Procedure:

<l>     Pair the students or make small groups of three or four. Give each
   group a tray of materials and a bucket of cold water with ice cubes.

<l>     Ask students what facts we might find out about penguins using the
   materials on the table and the bucket of ice water. List predictions
   on the board or a chart.

<l>     Have the students take turns and instruct one team member to put on
   a surgical glove. Have another student place five or six tablespoons
   of solid shortening into a small resealable plastic bag and "mush" it
   up.

<l>     Next, the student with the surgical glove places his/her hand into
   the resealable plastic bag with the shortening. Another team member
   will then place a rubberband around the students wrist to secure the
   top of the plastic bag.

<l>     The student with the blubber glove will now plunge both the blubber
   glove hand as well as his/her unprotected hand into the ice water. The
   other team members will time how long the student can keep each hand
   in the bucket of water. Allow each team member to experience this
   activity.

<l>     Finally, discuss the differences the students felt when they had
   both hands in the water. Ask the students to explain why it was easier
   to keep the blubber glove hand in the water longer. Ask the students
   how this experiment is related to penguins.

<h>   Instructional/Environmental Modifications:

<p>     In order to do conduct this learning experience I used our science
     lab. The set up is more conducive to working with cooperative
     learning groups and there is a sink with running water. This
     experience could be carried out in the classroom but it would
     require greater preparation.

<p>     I used a Phonic Ear Device to meet the needs of a hearing impaired
     student.

<h>   Time Required:

<p>   I spent about 20 minutes setting up the science lab prior to this
   lesson. I spent about a half an hour collecting and organizing
   materials. The learning experience itself required about 45-minutes.
   Assessment was on going throughout the lesson.

<h>   Resources:

<p>   For each pair of students you will need:

<l>   2 small plastic surgical gloves (or in place of the gloves, use 2 more
   resealable plastic bags)

<l>   2 plastic resealable bags

<l>   1 pound of solid vegetable shortening (such as Crisco)

<l>   2 rubberbands

<l>   a stop watch

<l>   a bucket of water with ice cubes

<h>   Assessment Plan:

<p>   The students tried to figure out what we were going to do based on the
   materials set up in the lab. We made a list of possibilities and
   altered the list as the experience continued. The students asked
   questions and tried to answer them as we went along. I was able to
   assess their level of understanding based on the types of questions
   they asked and the conclusions they drew during the experience.

<h>   Student Work: None Available

<h>   Reflection:

<p>   This experience was based on a similar lesson my student teacher had
   taken part in during an undergraduate course. We altered it somewhat
   to meet our needs. We also changed it so that the students were always
   making inquiries and trying to find out how the experience related to
   penguins. It didnt take them long!
