<h> Oil Paint

<h> What Is Oil Paint?

<p>   Oil paint, it would seem, needs little in the way of introduction, as
   it is the painting medium most people are most familiar with. The
   majority of paintings one sees in most galleries and museums are done
   with oil paint. Still, it never hurts to know a little more about the
   medium.

<p>   Oil paint consists of pigment suspended in a vegetable-based oil. The
   oils used are drying oils, which is to say that left exposed to air
   for a length of time, they eventually cure through an oxidation
   process and become hard and permanently affixed to the painting
   surface. Linseed oil is the most common, but safflower, poppy, and
   walnut oils are used as well. The different oils have different
   properties in terms of how long the curing process takes, how hard the
   oil film becomes, how resistant to cracking or yellowing it becomes,
   and so forth.

<p>   Once cured, a painting needs relatively little in the way of
   protection, although varnish is common to protect against atmospheric
   pollutants. Still, over time, the painting may be susceptible to
   cracking and/or yellowing. These risks can be lessened if proper care
   is taken when creating the painting in the first place, as certain
   techniques are more prone to eventual problems than others. See the
   section on Making Marks below.

<h> Buying Oil Paint

<p>   There are a few questions you need to answer before buying oil paints.

<h> Student Versus Artist Quality

<p>   This is the very first question a newcomer to oil painting has to
   answer for himself. The student grades are, as you might expect, less
   expensive, and of correspondingly lower quality. There is considerable
   debate among art educators as to whether the trade-off is worthwhile.
   I personally do not have strong feelings on the matter, so I can try
   to be reasonably objective here.

<p>   First, you might be wondering what "lower quality" actually means in
   practice. This can vary by manufacturer. In some cases, fillers may be
   used that compromise the permanence of the resulting paintings. That
   may or may not concern you at all when you are first starting out. It
   is also usually the case that less pigment is used per tube than in
   artist quality paint. As far as I can tell, if all your paints are
   student grade, this should not matter much, but it would seem true
   that it would take a lot of student quality yellow to make a green
   when mixed with an artist quality blue, for example.

<p>   Perhaps the most problematic issue with student grade paints is the
   tendency to use less expensive substitute pigments in some colors.
   These are generally labeled "hues".  For example, a paint labeled
   "Cadmium Red Hue" is more or less the same color as cadmium red but
   contains a less expensive substitute for the quite expensive cadmium
   red pigment. Many people consider this use of "hues" to be reason
   enough to avoid student grade paints. I disagree. Just because a
   pigment is less expensive does not mean it is inferior. I happen to
   prefer several of the cheaper pigments often used as substitutes for
   cadmium red over cadmium red itself. As long as you are aware you are
   not getting cadmium red, and therefore the paint will not behave in
   all respects like cadmium red, you might well be perfectly happy with
   what you are getting instead.

<p>   There may well be other more subjective issues with some student grade
   brands.  In particular the "feel" of the paint might be different from
   artist quality paints, in terms of thick or oily or buttery or creamy
   the paint feels. On the other hand, each artist quality brand feels
   different as well, so in the end, it comes down to personal preference
   in most cases.

<p>   Now, conversely, I should point out arguments in favor or using artist
   quality paint. To start with, the price difference is not that
   extreme, if you compare paints made from similar pigments and consider
   how much you will actually use. A tube of student quality ultramarine
   blue might sell for $4 and one of artist quality for $6, and either
   tube will most likely last you several months, depending on how much
   you paint. Sure, you will need more than one tube of paint, but still,
   the total difference in paint costs over the course of a year might
   well be less than the cost of dinner for two at a chain restaurant.

<p>   There is also the danger the student grade paint you choose will be so
   compromised in quality that you get frustrated with it and give up on
   painting. This would seem to be most likely if the pigment strength
   was very low or texture way too oily or too stiff, which can indeed
   making mixing and applying paint more difficult than it need be.

<p>   So you may well decide that the difference in price is more than
   worthwhile. That will have to be up to you.

<h> Water Miscible Oils

<p>   Oil paints are traditionally made from linseed oil, which, like most
   oils, is not water soluble. This means that you typically need
   something like turpentine, mineral spirits, or a citrus-based solvent
   for cleanup and for thinning paint. Recently, paints made from
   chemically modified oils have come on the market, and these allow
   cleanup with just soap and water. Several manufacturers offer these
   types of paints. Some say they do not handle the same as ordinary
   oils, but given the convenience as well as ecological advantages of
   not needing to deal with solvents, these paints are proving quite
   popular, especially with people new to the medium.

<h> Alkyds

<p>   Another type of chemically modified oil paint are the alkyds. These
   are like traditional oil paints in all respects except one: they cure
   much more quickly. Whereas a typical oil painting might take a week or
   more before it is dry enough to handle easily without risking damage
   to the surface, an alkyd painting reaches that point in around one
   day.

<h> Oil Paint Brands

<p>   Once you've settled the student versus artist grade issue, then you
   can pick specific brands. I do not have enough experience with
   different brands to really offer much advice. I can recommend The Oil
   Painting Book, by Bill Creevy, for information on different brands,
   although it is bound to be somewhat out of date, as smaller companies
   come and go and even larger ones changes their formulations. But here
   are some of the more popular brands and what I know about them:

<l> Winsor & Newton

<p>   This is one of the most popular oil paint brands, found in most art
   stores. Their artist quality paints are relatively inexpensive, and
   their student grade paints (Winton) are even more so.

<l> Grumbacher

<p>   This is another of the most popular brands, cheaper than Winsor &
   Newton for the most part although probably of lesser quality as well.

<l> Utrecht

<p>   This is one of the least expensive artist quality paints on the
   market. It is therefore quite popular, even though it is available
   only via mail order or from a few select stores.

<l> Rembrandt

<p>   These oil paints are perhaps a little more expensive than Winsor &
   Newton, but they have a good reputation for quality. Their paints are
   generally lighter and more mousse-like in texture than most.

<l>Old Holland

<p>   Although it is not as large a company as Winsor & Newton, Grumbacher,
   or Talens, Old Holland oil paints are still reasonably widely
   available.  They considered by many to be the finest of the major
   brands, and the price is consistent with this.

<l> Gamblin

<p>   This is one of the more popular of the smaller brands. The paints are
   made by an artist, Robert Gamblin.

<l> M. Graham

<p>   These paints are made with walnut oil instead of linseed oil. The
   advantages and disadvantages of this have been debated over the years,
   but the claim is that paintings made from walnut oil paints will
   yellow less and be less susceptible to cracking over time. One
   tradeoff is that walnut oil dries more slowly than linseed oil. M.
   Graham also makes an alkyd white, and by using this in conjunction
   with walnut oil colors for the rest of your painting, you end up with
   a curing time more similar to linseed oil, since white is mixed into
   most other colors.

<h> Palette

<p>   Here, I do not mean the thing you squeeze your paint onto. I mean, the
   list of colors you squeeze out. Different painters use different
   palettes, and many alter their palette according to the painting.

<p>   Choosing a palette is such a personal thing, but I can mention some of
   the things artists often consider.

<p>   Color is the most obvious consideration in choosing a palette, but
   even there, there are several things you want to optimize in choosing
   your colors.

<p>   First, you want to be able to mix any color you might possibly need.
   This generally requires having at the very least the three primaries,
   and many artists prefer having two of each primary - a warmer and
   cooler variant.

<p>   Second, you want to make it easy to mix the colors you need most
   often. For example, a palette consisting of just the primaries may
   make it possible to mix a believable skin tone, but one that also
   includes some more subdued "earth tones" might make it easier.

<p>   You often hear artists talking about a "limited palette". This simply
   means having fewer colors available than one might otherwise choose.
   For some artists, 12 colors is limited. Others may routinely paint
   with only 6 and consider 3 a limited palette.

<p>   One reason to consider limiting your palette is color harmony. Roughly
   speaking, this is how good the colors in a painting look together. It
   is often easier to get colors that go well together if they are all
   mixed from just a few palette colors, rather than having every
   possible color on your palette.

<p>   Another reason to consider limiting your palette is that it is cheaper
   to buy a few tubes of paint than many. It is also easier to carry
   fewer tubes around, so plein air painters are especially likely to try
   to limit their palettes. And some argue that it is easier to learn to
   use just a few colors well than to try to learn to use many at once. I
   personally find color mixing greatly simplified when there are fewer
   colors on my palette - there are fewer choices, making it is easier to
   see what paints need to be mixed to get a given color.

<p>   In addition to the color of the paints, there are other considerations
   in choosing a palette as well. There is a lot of variance between
   pigments in price, so even within a single brand, some paints might
   cost three or more times as much as others. Again, price does not
   necessarily correlate with quality here, and quite viable palettes can
   be formed from the least expensive pigments. Also, some pigments are
   more permanent than others, and this too does not necessarily
   correlate with price. Some pigments are more transparent than others,
   and depending on your painting style you might have a preference for
   one or the other. Or you might have a preference for having both
   transparent and opaque choices. Finally, some pigments are considered
   toxic, and some artists choose to avoid these for health reasons.

<p>   So with all this said, somehow you have to get to the point of
   actually choosing your paints. There are some pigments that virtually
   every manufacturer offers, but the naming often differs, and there are
   many colors unique to a given manufacturer. Some colors offered by
   many manufacturers are actually mixtures of two or more pigments, and
   these mixtures will vary even between similarly-named colors from
   different manufacturers. There are far more colors available than I
   can tell you about. But I am listing some of the ones I often see
   people using.

<p>   The following colors are the full-intensity colors, sometimes just
   called the color wheel colors. They are listed more or less in color
   wheel order. Remember, between two similar colors, the warmer one is
   the one closer to orange on the wheel, and the cooler one is the one
   closer to blue.
   
<l>     * Azo yellow - cool yellow
<l>     * Cadmium yellow light / lemon - opaque cool yellow. All cadmiums
       are expensive
<l>     * Hansa / arylide yellow - transparent neutral (neither especially
       cool nor warm) yellow
<l>     * Cadmium yellow medium / deep - opaque warm yellow
<l>     * Cadmium orange - opaque
<l>     * Cadmium red light / medium - opaque warm red
<l>     * Naphthol / Pyrrol red - transparent warm red
<l>     * Alizarin crimson - transparent cool red, seldom used any more
       because it is not very permanent
<l>     * Quinacridone red / rose / violet - transparent cool red
<l>     * Dioxazine purple - transparent
<l>     * Ultramarine / French ultramarine blue - transparent blue on the
       violet side
<l>     * Cobalt blue - transparent neutral blue, very expensive
<l>     * Phthalo blue - transparent blue on the green side, extremely
       powerful (some say overpowering)
<l>     * Prussian blue - transparent greenish, coppery blue
<l>     * Cerulean - opaque, light greenish blue, expensive when genuine but
       often produced as a mixture of cheaper pigments
<l>     * Viridian - deep, transparent cool green, expensive
<l>     * Phthalo green - transparent cool green, also very powerful
<l>     * Sap green - warm green, often a mixture of pigments

<p>   The following colors are less intense, and are often referred to as
   the earth tones.
   
<l>     * Naples yellow - very light and somewhat dull yellow, sometimes
       used as a substitute for white
<l>     * Yellow ochre - dull mustard yellow
<l>     * Burnt sienna / red oxide - reddish brown
<l>     * Burnt umber - dull brownish gray
<l>     * Payne's gray - gray from a mixture of pigments
<l>     * Black - several different options available here
<l>     * White - several different options here too; titanium is probably
       the most popular

<p>   Of course, I am not suggesting you have all these colors on your
   palette. But hopefully it well help you decide what colors interested
   you. It might also help you understand suggested palettes you find
   elsewhere.

<p>   One word on black, which is probably the most controversial of
   pigments in oil. Some say you should not have it at all, some say have
   it but do not rely on it every time you you want to darken a color,
   and some simply love it. I am of the opinion that it should be thought
   of as a color like any other. If you are trying to limit your palette
   and include only a bare minimum to get the job done, black is clearly
   not necessary. Most colors can be darkened effective by mixing in
   their complement, and a reasonable approximation to black itself can
   be mixed simply by combining other dark pigments. On the other hand,
   there is nothing wrong with black pigment that would make me avoid it
   if I was including other so-called "convenience" colors - ones you can
   reasonably mix yourself - like purple, orange, green, or any of the
   earth tones.

<p>   Once you have chosen your colors, you can arrange them physically on
   your palette any way you like. But of course you do need a physical
   palette to do this on. Most traditional is wood that has been primed
   to make it less absorbent, but glass and plastic palettes are also
   used. There are also disposable palettes, which are pads of paper that
   has been specially coated to make it less absorbent.

<p>   As for the process of squeezing out the paint, typical is to squeeze
   them out along the edges of your palette, in blobs of about the same
   amount you would use to brush your teeth. Many artists put the colors
   in color wheel order. The center of your palette is left clear for
   mixing.

<h> Mediums And Solvents

<p>   There is a large variety of painting mediums (and for whatever reason,
   in this context, the plural of medium is usually "mediums", not
   "media") on the market. These are substances that you can mix with
   your paints as you apply them to get different effects. Some mediums
   are designed to speed up drying, others to slow it down. Some are
   designed to make paint more fluid, some to make it more like paste.
   Other mediums are designed to make paints more transparent.

<p>   Strictly speaking, mediums are not necessary in order to paint with
   oil, and many artists - especially plein air painters, who are always
   looking to cut down on unnecessary supplies - do not use them at all.
   But some paintings techniques - especially ones that involve painting
   in multiple layers over the course of days, weeks, or months - require
   the use of mediums. I will discuss this further in the section on
   Making Marks.

<p>   As a more or less separate issue, there are solvents. You can use a
   solvent as a painting medium, and it has the effect of making the
   paint more fluid, transparent, and faster drying. But solvents are
   also used for cleaning brushes, both between strokes and at the end of
   a session, and for other general cleanup of oil paint. And a rag
   dipped in solvent can be used to wipe paint off the surface, to
   correct or lighten an area. Solvents are by nature pretty toxic, and
   one reason the main reason water miscible oils are so popular is that
   they allow you to avoid solvents entirely. The traditional solvent is
   turpentine, which is not only toxic as a liquid but also gives off
   very powerful fumes and care should be taken using it indoors.
   Odorless mineral spirits are popular today, although they are almost
   as toxic - the fumes simply do not smell as strong. Some are turning
   to citrus based solvents, which are less toxic in some ways, but still
   not to be taken lightly.

<p>   Although few seem to realize this, solvents are not actually necessary
   for cleanup even with traditional oil paint. Oil can be used instead.
   Some people use cheap vegetable oil for cleaning their brushes,
   although it would concern me that this is not a drying oil, and any
   oil left in the brush might interfere with the paint. I use walnut
   oil, which is the same oil my paints are made from. I can use this oil
   as a painting medium - which makes the paint more fluid but also
   slower drying - as well as for cleanup. Walnut oil is more expensive
   than vegetable oil, but I use so little of it - about a tablespoon or
   two per painting - that it hardly matters. You do have to be careful
   to buy walnut oil with no preservatives, which would function to
   retard the drying even further.

<h> Surfaces

<p>   There are basically three different types of surfaces that artists use
   for oil paintings: stretched canvas, canvas-covered boards, and
   gesso-primed boards. Any of these can be bought ready-made, or you can
   construct your own, usually for less money. Some artists will also
   experiment with painting on paper on metal or other surfaces, but the
   majority of paintings are on one of the aforementioned surfaces.

<p>   Oil paint by its nature is somewhat corrosive, and most surfaces need
   to be protected from these effects by priming with either a glue or an
   acrylic gesso. When you buy ready-made canvases, they are already
   primed. If you make your own surface, you can either buy pre-primed
   canvas, or buy raw canvas and prime it yourself.

<p>   Stretched canvas is canvas that has been stretched tight like a drum
   head across a wooden frame called a stretcher. Stretched canvas has
   the advantage of being relatively lightweight even in large sizes.
   Canvas covered boards are popular for plein air work as they are
   generally thinner than the stretcher bars, making it easier to
   transport several of them. You also do not have to worry about the sun
   shining through the back of a board. Cheap canvas boards are made from
   cardboard. Better ones are made from some sort of wood. These boards
   can also be primed directly, without first covering them with canvas.
   The surface feels quite different from canvas, as it is generally
   smoother. Some prefer this, some do not.

<h> Brushes and Other Tools

<p>   To further add to the confusion faced by beginning oil painters, there
   are as many different brushes to choose from as paints and mediums.
   The good news is, you can get by just fine with very few brushes. It
   is not unheard of for plein air painters to use just one brush for an
   entire painting, although most prefer having a couple of different
   sizes available. And it is more convenient if you have different
   brushes for different colors - less cleaning between strokes is
   necessary. Literally having one brush for each color is not necessary.
   You can still get some benefit from using one brush for dark colors,
   another for light. Or one for warm colors, another for cool. Either
   way, you reduce the risk of creating muddy colors by inadvertently
   mixing very unrelated colors together.

<p>   Brushes come in different shapes, materials, and sizes. The common
   shapes are:
   
<l>     * Round - an elongated cone
<l>     * Flat - rectangular when seen straight on, thin from the side
<l>     * Filbert - like a flat but with rounded corners on the tip
<l>     * Bright - a relatively short flat

<p>   Other specialty brushes are available, such as the fan blender, which
   some used to softly blend colors together after they have already been
   applied.

<p>   While many people do use different shaped brushes for different
   purposes, there is relatively little agreement on which shapes are
   best for which purposes. And in fact, it is just as common for an
   artist to use only only shape for all parts of a painting. Filberts
   are probably the most popular choice. I am finding I prefer the
   variety of marks I can make with a flat for most purposes, although
   for final detail work, a small, soft, round seems to work best for me.

<p>   This leads to issue of brush material. Hog bristle is the standard,
   and it is fortunately fairly cheap. There are also synthetic brushes
   that mimic the behavior of bristle, and these can be cheaper still.
   The key attribute of these brushes is that they are fairly stiff,
   allowing them to pick up and move thick paint easily. However, when
   you are trying to lay new paint on top of an existing layer of wet
   paint, you often want a softer brush that will not disturb the
   existing layers as much. Sable is one of the traditional choices here,
   but it is expensive, so synthetic sable substitutes are a good choice
   for this purpose.

<p>   A given brush company will offer a line of brushes in a given material
   of a given quality, and usually offer several sizes of each of the
   above shapes within that line. The sizes are numbered, but the
   numbering is very inconsistent from brand to brand. About all you can
   be sure of is that within a shape within a given line, higher numbers
   are bigger. But what one company calls a #6 round might be a #9 from
   another company. And even within a single line, a #8 filbert might be
   much larger than a #8 bright. So it is unfortunately difficult if not
   impossible to give advice on brush size.

<p>   The one piece of advice most educators seem to agree on is that you
   should use bigger brushes than you might otherwise think, to avoid
   getting too caught up in detail too soon. I definitely agree with
   this. When I work on an 11x14" canvas, much of my painting is done
   with a filbert brush that is almost an inch wide, which I alternate
   with a flat that is only a little smaller. As I progress, I start
   relying more on a pair of brushes maybe half that size. But although I
   do have a small soft round brush - about the size of the tip of the
   tail of a mouse - that I reserve for final details, most of my
   paintings do not require this level of detail.

<p>   My recommendation, then, is to have a couple of relatively large
   brushes - from most manufacturers, this means numbers in the teens -
   that you can switch between (light and dark or warm and cool) for much
   of the painting. Also a couple of medium sized ones you can use the
   same way. And if you do get a brush numbered 1 or 0, do not expect to
   use it much.

<p>   The other tools typically used by oil painters are knives. These are
   not knives in the sense of being particularly sharp, but you probably
   would not be allowed to take them on an airplane. There are palette
   knives and painting knives, and some people maintain there is an
   important distinction between them, but others do not bother, and
   instead simply note that there are different shapes of knives
   available. They can be made of metal, usually with a wooden handle, or
   plastic.

<p>   Knives are used for three purposes: to mix paint on your palette
   before applying it, to apply paint (as an alternative to using a
   brush), and to scrape off your palette when you are finished painting.
   The latter use is probably the only one that pretty much requires a
   knife, or some sort of scraping device. A long flat knife is best for
   this. Using a knife for mixing colors is not strictly necessary, as
   you can do this with a brush as well. But it is easier to wipe off a
   knife, and therefore easier to mix clean colors.

<p>   Using a knife to apply paint to canvas is something that a few artists
   do a lot - some to the point of not using brushes. Others never use a
   knife for this purpose. Others use the knife this way on occasion for
   the effects it can produce. It is easier to lay clean color on top of
   existing wet paint with a knife than with a brush. A knife stroke
   looks different from a brush stroke, so if you do mix brush and knife
   work in a painting, it pays to be aware of this, so you do not have
   some passages that stand out as being different from the rest if that
   is not your intention. But that might be exactly the effect you want.

<h> Making Marks

<p>   This leads directly into the matter of how we apply paint to the
   canvas. Oil painters tend to use one of a handful of basic approaches
   to painting, and the approach you choose has a lot to do with the
   techniques you will use.

<p>   The approach I am most familiar with is called alla prima painting,
   which basically means completing a painting in one session. With oil
   paint, that means the paint is always wet, so if you ever need to put
   one color over another - and I do this all the time - you are working
   wet into wet. The challenge here is avoid having the layer underneath
   muddy up the layer on top. One way to do this is to apply the first
   layers sparingly - either using a mostly dry brush with little paint
   on it, or by so diluting the paint with solvent (not oil!) that it can
   actually dry in just a few minutes. If you need to layer paint on top
   of thicker paint than this, you can use a medium such as oil to make
   the top layers more fluid, which can help it stay on top. You may also
   find either softer brushes or a knife can make applying paint on top
   of wet paint easier. But you should also consider simply expecting
   some mixing of layers to occur, and in fact to depend on it. For
   example, if the first layer is red, and you want it to be more orange,
   instead of mixing up just the right orange and trying to lay it on top
   without mixing, try simply laying some yellow on top and doing the
   mixing on the canvas. This approach works if the colors are related,
   so the corollary to this is, try to avoid putting down color that is
   unrelated to what you want the final color to be. if you have to do
   this, put it down as sparingly as possible.

<p>   Alla prima painting is the norm for plein air painters. Studio
   painters may work alla prima, but at least as many prefer to working
   in layers. This means painting one layer and letting it dry before
   working the next. While one can approach this as simply alla prima
   painting that has been slowed down, and with less worry about layers
   muddying each other, the traditional reason for working in layers is
   to use the technique of glazing. This involves building up colors
   through layers of transparent paint. For example, if you had a red
   area you wanted orange, you would first allow the red area to dry -
   possibly a matter of days. Then you would mix your yellow paint with a
   special glazing medium to make it fluid and transparent, and add a
   thin layer on top of the red. The result would be an orange with a
   different look that you would get if you simply mixed the red and
   yellow.

<p>   When working in layers, it is important to honor the fat over lean
   rule. A lean layer has relatively little oil - either because there is
   little paint period, or because the oil paint has been diluted with
   solvent. Fat layers are paints applied full strength from the tube, or
   applied with the addition of a medium contains yet more oil. The lean
   layers below will dry faster than the fat ones on top, which is what
   you want. If you painted a lean layer over a fat one, the fat layer
   would not actually have completely cured yet, and the new lean layer
   would actually cure before the fat one underneath ever finished. As
   the fat layer continued to cure, it would tend to cause the already
   dry lean layer above it to crack.

<p>   So, once you have decided on a basic approach, it is finally time to
   actually pick up the brush. Every artist has their own technique here,
   but the basic order of operations is usually similar.

<p>   The first step is to make sure the brush you are using is clean
   enough. I find a good wipe with a paper towel is often enough, but for
   a more thorough cleaning, you can swirl  the brush in solvent or oil
   first.

<p>   You can use a knife to premix the color you want to apply if you like,
   but in many cases it works as well to simply grab some paint with your
   brush, move it to a clean area of your palette, and then take the
   other side of the same brush and grab a bit of another color to mix
   in. It is usually wise to start by guessing which color you will need
   more of in the mix and start with a good quantity of it, then add the
   lesser color just a little bit at a time until the color is right.
   Otherwise, you will tend to overestimate how much of the lesser color
   you need to start with, and it will take a whole tube of the dominant
   color to get the mixture right.

<p>   Once you have a mixture, dip your brush in, and stroke the canvas.
   That is the easy part! Depending on how much paint you loaded, you can
   keep stroking on a dry canvas until the paint on the brush is gone. If
   there was already a layer of wet paint on the canvas, however, you
   might get just a couple of new strokes before you need to wipe the
   brush off and get fresh paint - each stroke is likely to pick up as
   much old wet paint as it deposits new paint. The workarounds of using
   a medium to make the top layers more fluid or using a softer brush
   might gain you a couple of extra strokes at most.

<p>   That is the basic cycle. When you are done applying a given color, you
   clean your brush - again, a simple wipe may be sufficient - and start
   again. Or switch to a different brush if you are changing colors
   drastically and want to lessen the risk of creating muddy mixtures.

<p>   When you are done painting for the day, brushes will usually need a
   more thorough cleaning, or the paint left in them will dry and ruin
   the brush. This means a longer swirl in the solvent or oil, perhaps
   working the brush on the palette to remove the paint further, wiping
   the brush well, and possibly repeating this whole process. You should
   also scrape the mixtures off your palette, although the remainder of
   the original blobs you squeezed out along the edges can often be left
   alone and reused for a few days.

<h> My Palette

<p>   I started off using the so-called split primary palette - a warm and
   cool variant of each primary - plus burnt sienna and of course white.
   I never felt limited by this, but I began to notice a few things. I
   almost never used the burnt sienna. And eventually I came to realize
   that I was tending to choose one of each primary for a given painting,
   and then to stick with it. That is, while I had two reds, if I used
   the warm one for one thing in the painting, I would tend to want to
   use that same red anywhere I needed red, to aid color harmony. And
   this did not really introduce any major hardship. It is true that
   mixing a good orange was a little trickier if I was using the cool red
   and yellow instead of the warm, but I found I could produce perfectly
   acceptable results by simply making sure I started with a clean brush
   or palette knife.

<p>   So I started using just a neutral yellow, a cool red, and ultramarine
   blue. I liked the ultramarine because I like intense violets and dull
   greens in my landscapes, and ultramarine lends itself well to both.
   Every so often I would find the need to have a more intense green than
   I could mix this way, so I added an intense green to my palette. It
   also helps me get more realistic sky color when mixed with ultramarine
   blue. For a while I was still thinking mixing oranges were a problem,
   so I put the warm red back on in my kit. I would decide which red to
   use for any given painting before starting. Usually, it was the warm
   red for sunny days and the cool for overcast ones, or sunny days where
   I needed especially intense violets. I have found the warm red I have
   (naphthol) - is versatile enough that I almost never choose the cool
   one (quinacridone rose) any more. But realistically, I have found that
   the quinacridone is pretty versatile, too.

<p>   So my basic palette now consists of
   
<l>     * Azo / arylide yellow (a mixture)
<l>     * Naphthol red
<l>     * Ultramarine blue
<l>     * Phthalo green
<l>     * Titanium white
<l>     * Quinacridone rose - just in case

<p>   As it happens, this is very similar to the palette preferred by a
   number of other more well-known landscape painters, including Scott
   Christiansen and Kevin MacPherson. I do not think Scott uses or
   recommends the phthalo green, but I find it a useful addition for the
   reasons I mentioned. Scott mentions use a red like naphthol while
   Kevin mentions one more like quinacridone rose, but again, I find
   either works pretty well.

<p>   This palette is admittedly optimized for landscape work, but I have
   used it for portraits and figures and been just as happy with the
   results. Some people cannot imagine not having earth tones or colors
   that more closely resemble skin on their palettes, but with a palette
   that offers so few choices, it is easy enough to figure out what
   colors you need in order to mix any other color you want. It is just a
   matter of how much of each to use, and it doesn't take much
   experimentation to figure that out.
