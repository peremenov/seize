<p>   Does anyone know the open carry status in Tennessee? I'll be
   travelling there from NC at the end of this week. Also, what about car
   carry?

<p>   From what I understand about the law in TN, you cannot carry on your
   person or loaded in your car a pistol or any other loaded firearm. If
   you carry a loaded pistol on your person or in your car, it is defined
   by law a "carry with the intent to go armed" and is illegal unless you
   have a license to carry. So I would carry unloaded in a case and
   seperated from the ammunition. -ICPjuggalo

   to move there, hope you have a successful trip and carry safetly.
