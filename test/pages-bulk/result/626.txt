<h>                   GENE TECHNOLOGY (NEW SOUTH WALES) BILL
<h>                 GENE TECHNOLOGY (GM CROP MORATORIUM) BILL

<h>                                                                Page: 784

<h>                               Second Reading

<h>       Debate resumed from an earlier hour.
	   
<p>       The Hon DUNCAN GAY (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) [2.34 p.m.]:
       Given earlier debate on the Gene Technology (New South Wales)
       Bill, it has probably escaped the notice of some honourable
       members that this bill is cognate with the Gene Technology (GM
       Crop Moratorium) Bill--an issue to which the Minister referred in
       his second reading speech. When this legislation was introduced in
       the lower House the then shadow Minister for health said that the
       Opposition would not oppose it. The only difference now is that
       that the Gene Technology (New South Wales) Bill is cognate with
       the Gene Technology (GM Crop Moratorium) Bill. The objects of the
       Gene Technology (New South Wales) Bill are to adopt in this State
       a uniform Australian approach to the regulation of genetically
       modified organisms.
	   
<p>       The Coalition does not oppose the legislation. We believe it is
       essential to have a national regulatory regime for this important
       and contentious issue. The new regulatory scheme involves the
       adoption and application of the Commonwealth gene technology laws
       by the States and Territories. This bill, which is the New South
       Wales component of the nationally consistent regulatory scheme,
       follows the Commonwealth Gene Technology Act and the Gene
       Technology (Licence Charges) Act, which commenced in June last
       year. The Commonwealth gene technology legislation provides for
       the establishment of the gene technology regulator, an independent
       decision maker on licence applications who reports directly to the
       Commonwealth Parliament. The Gene Technology Ministerial Council
       has now been established to oversee the operation of the gene
       technology regulator, and to issue policy principles and
       guidelines. That council comprises Ministers from the Commonwealth
       and each State and Territory.
	   
<p>       Under the legislation all activity involving genetically modified
       organisms is prohibited unless the activity is an exempt dealing
       or notifiable low-risk dealing licensed by the regulator or
       entered on the register of genetically modified organisms. In
       considering licence applications the gene technology regulator
       will undertake scientific risk assessment in consultation with
       interest groups. The regulator will undertake research on risks
       posed by genetically modified organisms, monitor activities
       involving genetically modified organisms. At the moment the
       regulator who occupies the position is a woman, and rightly so.
       She has a broad range of enforcement powers. The gene technology
       legislation establishes three gene technology committees. The
       first is the Gene Technology Technical Advisory Committee, which
       provides scientific and technical advice to the gene technology
       regulator on each licence application.
	   
<p>       The second is the Gene Technology Community Consultative
       Committee, which provides community views. The third is the Gene
       Technology Ethics Committee, which provides advice on ethics,
       guidelines and prohibitions. The Commonwealth legislation bans the
       cloning of human beings and certain human animal cell
       experimentation. Those prohibitions were included as an interim
       measure until the States had nationally consistent legislation in
       place to comprehensively ban cloning of human beings. The New
       South Wales Government has previously indicated that it believes
       the national scheme has significant advantages over each State and
       Territory establishing its own regulatory system. The Coalition
       does not disagree with that position. Queensland, Tasmania, South
       Australia and Victoria have already introduced legislation to
       implement the national scheme. It is entirely appropriate that New
       South Wales joins those States and the Commonwealth in enacting
       this legislation. As I indicated earlier, the Coalition supports
       the Gene Technology (New South Wales) Bill. I last spoke in debate
       on these cognate bills prior to question time, the suspension of
       the sitting for lunch and the introduction of other legislation.
	   
<p>       Since then consultation has taken place between Government,
       crossbench and Opposition members, and I acknowledge that the
       Government has generously accepted the suggestion that the
       Committee stage of the bill should not occur until next Tuesday,
       given that the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator will not
       take any action until at least 9 June and probably not before 19
       June. To that end, I thank the Minister for Agriculture and
       Fisheries, who is at the table, his staff and the Leader of the
       Government in this place for their assistance. I think it is
       important that we take as much time as we can--within the
       constraints of the deadlines we all face--to consider legislation
       such as this in a bipartisan manner. We must get this bill right.
       We must guarantee the policy of zero contamination and protect our
       markets.
	   
<p>       I am concerned about buffer zones. I would like to see buffer
       zones of at least 400 metres, preferably 800 metres, between GM
       and non-GM crops. I had some difficulty finding information on
       this subject--what information I have is gathered partly from
       seminars--but I acknowledge that views about buffer zones vary
       widely. For example, some protocols recommend buffer zones of only
       five metres. I do not pretend to be an expert in this area--far
       from it. I would like to see the establishment of a committee of
       experts who could formulate properly the correct buffer zone
       protocols. A balanced group would comprise those people named in
       the Minister's press release and representatives of organisations
       that I have mentioned in my contribution today, such as the Grain
       Harvesters Association and the Australian Wheat Board. Such a
       committee could produce effective regulations to protect farmers
       from any possible problems.
	   
<p>       I am concerned about the proposal to plant 5,000 hectares of trial
       crop. That is an extraordinarily large area. It would be difficult
       to control, supervise and evaluate such a crop properly. I believe
       the trial planting should be about 1,000 hectares--perhaps even
       less. I understand that in the first year companies will probably
       be unable to plant more than 100 hectares given that it is late in
       the season and the recent season was not terrific for any crops,
       GM or non-GM. I gather that only one person will want to plant in
       the first year and that another will join in later. Some
       honourable members who speak in this debate will advocate planting
       smaller trial crops, and concerned farmers across the State have
       put it to me that smaller trials would be better. However, given
       that it will be difficult to scrutinise and enforce the policy of
       zero contamination, I believe we would be better having a lesser
       number of larger individual trials. In other words, rather than
       having 100 9-hectare trials it would be better to have 10
       90-hectare trials. That is a commonsense way of protecting the
       interests of the people of this State.
	   
<p>       We believe in that philosophy very strongly. We believe also that
       the representatives that I have mentioned should be included on
       the ministerial advisory committee. We appreciate that in order to
       gauge the effect on markets a critical mass of grain must be
       harvested from the GM crop trials. That is essential if proper
       appraisal is to occur. However, we have said from the outset that
       we must ensure that the trials are not used as a de facto
       commercial release. We plan to move amendments in Committee to
       enshrine in legislation the status of the ministerial committee.
       It must be able to put its guidelines into effect through the
       Minister. We think that is important and it is the proper way to
       proceed.
	   
<p>       The Opposition is not closing the door on a potential commercial
       release of GM material in the future. We are simply saying: not
       yet. We have never said never. As one farmer commented to me, it
       is not so much a moratorium as a postponement until we are sure of
       the effects on our markets. We must not take any steps from which
       we cannot retreat that will adversely affect our potential
       overseas markets not only in canola but also in wheat, sheep and
       cattle. The Opposition will support both the bills. Although we
       believe the provisions are inadequate, they impose a moratorium of
       sorts and we would contradict our election policy if we were to
       oppose them.
	   
<p>       Mr IAN COHEN [2.47 p.m.]: The Greens are pleased that the
       Government is honouring its promise made prior to the last
       election to suspend the production of genetically modified food
       crops until at least 2006. However, the Greens have serious
       concerns about the interpretation of the moratorium as proposed in
       the Gene Technology (GM Crop Moratorium) Bill 2003 and the
       loopholes that could permit the planting of genetically engineered
       food crops. The Greens, environment, consumer and farmer groups
       are concerned that the bill as it stands contains serious
       loopholes that may undermine the Government's original intention
       to impose a three-year moratorium in spite of massive community
       concerns about the risks associated with genetically modified
       crops.
	   
<p>       I was pleased to hear from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition
       that the Government does not intend to proceed today to the
       Committee stage of the bill. Many complex issues must be
       considered and Parliamentary Counsel is still preparing numerous
       amendments. My office received advice from the Office of the Gene
       Technology Regulator that it would not be prepared to collate all
       the information provided by the many people who have made
       representations on these issues until at least 9 June. It will
       only then make some clear decisions regarding that information.
       Therefore the time pressure is no longer so acute and I am pleased
       to hear--albeit indirectly via the Opposition--that the Government
       is prepared to have the second reading debate today and to proceed
       to the Committee stage next week, which is still well within the
       time limitations that apply to this important legislation.
	   
<p>       The legislation as it stands does not provide for a moratorium.
       What it will achieve is total discretion in the Minister to decide
       whether he will declare a moratorium. It does not state which
       crops will have a moratorium on them. If the Minister decides to
       declare a moratorium on a crop it will be done so by an order
       printed in the Government Gazette. There will be no parliamentary
       oversight and no possibility of this Chamber disallowing the
       decision of the Minister. Apart from this giant loophole in the
       legislation there is still an even bigger one. The legislation
       allows the Minister to provide for exemptions at his whim for
       trial crops. New South Wales Farmers want a 5,000 hectare trial
       canola crop to be allowed under this legislation, which just
       happens to be the same size as the crop currently being considered
       by the Gene Technology Regulator. The executive of New South Wales
       Farmers and their friends in the genetic engineering industry
       declare that this 5,000-hectare crop is a market trial and farmers
       told us yesterday that they need to be able to walk around the
       crop. This 5,000-hectare crop is clearly a commercial crop and if
       allowed by way of exemption by the Minister it would make a
       mockery of the Government's stated intention of declaring a
       moratorium.
	   
<p>       Will the Minister, who is strongly in favour of genetic
       engineering, assure this House and the public that he will not
       allow so-called trial crops of this size? If so, will the Minister
       back this up by supporting amendments closing the loopholes? The
       Greens believe--I am sure the majority of the community would
       agree--that a moratorium actually means there is to be a
       prohibition on the growing of all GE food crops, including GE
       trials, such as the moratorium recently announced by the Victorian
       Government which does include a prohibition on genetic
       engineering¯
	   
<p>       The Hon. Ian Macdonald: That is not right.
	   
<p>       Mr IAN COHEN: The Minister says that is not the case. However, I
       have received that information and I am certainly open to be
       informed of any changes in the situation. If the Victorian
       moratorium is somewhat different, that does not change the Greens
       unequivocal position supporting a moratorium in the true sense of
       the word. I thought the Minister would understand what a
       moratorium means given his personal history of activities in
       society years ago. The Greens stay with that concept but I will be
       open-minded about any press release from Victoria about the nature
       of the moratorium. Unfortunately the bill does not propose a
       moratorium at all but simply gives the Minister the discretionary
       power to make an order to prohibit the planting of certain GE food
       crops if he so chooses on the one hand, and on the other it gives
       him the power to make exemptions to that order to allow for
       so-called GE trial crops of an unspecified size to go ahead.
       Before I began my contribution to this debate I put to the
       Minister that there is no specification of the intended size of
       the trial, and that is something the Greens want resolved if
       trials are to be a part of this so-called moratorium.
	   
<p>       The bill provides no mechanism for genuine community
       participation, no reassessment of the moratorium after three years
       as promised by the Premier and an inadequate ministerial advisory
       council which is clearly biased towards the pro-GE lobby and to
       ensuring canola is planted by exemption. The Government's press
       release of 3 March announced the moratorium but made no mention of
       allowing GE trial crops to proceed. The only exclusion the
       Government referred to is GE cotton because it is essentially a
       non-food crop and is already extensively grown in New South Wales.
       This may be a reasonable compromise but I remind honourable
       members that GE cottonseed oil is extensively used in blended
       vegetable oils without the public's knowledge and GE cottonmeal is
       also included in animal products which are fed to cattle.
	   
<p>       According to the new European Union GE labelling laws, New South
       Wales meat would need to be labelled to indicate that animals had
       been fed with GE product. I believe New South Wales is
       jeopardising its meat trade by allowing animals to feed on
       genetically engineered products, and I am certain that once
       consumers actually have an unambiguous choice in the supermarket
       through fair labelling, the real market for GE food will be
       exposed. It was interesting that in submissions to the
       crossbenches yesterday the non-GE farmers said that GE cotton
       trash fed to cattle is so much cheaper that it makes it very
       difficult for them to use non-GE cotton trash. I wonder whether it
       is just the productivity cost or whether the restrictions that
       have to be undertaken to guarantee the non-GE nature of the
       material is increasing the price artificially.
	   
<p>       The Gene Technology (GM Crop Moratorium) Bill is essentially a
       trust-me piece of legislation and it is not what the Government
       promised the community. It would be reasonable for the community
       to conclude at this stage that it has been dudded on the promise
       for a three-year GE moratorium. I hope that the Minister has some
       good news to tell us about the details and timing of his first
       order to at least reassure the community that he is genuine. The
       Greens have a number of problems with both cognate bills today,
       which I will detail in the course of my speech. I will also
       foreshadow amendments that the Greens and other crossbenchers
       propose to address these serious flaws.
	   
<p>       Honourable members will recall the Gene Technology (New South
       Wales) Bill came before this House last year. At that time a joint
       crossbench letter signed by all but one of the crossbench members
       at the time--it was not signed by the Hon. John Tingle who instead
       made a personal call on the Premier on the issue--asked that the
       bill be delayed in order to allow time for the completion of the
       Standing Committee on State Development inquiry into genetically
       modified food. An interim report from the inquiry was finally
       released but the inquiry did not complete its task. It is fair to
       say that the inquiry raised more questions than it answered and we
       are still no clearer today about how the risks associated with the
       introduction of genetically engineered crops will be eliminated in
       New South Wales. Having participated in the inquiry and having
       listened to serious concerns raised by farmers and consumers, I
       believe it would be extremely unwise for any government to proceed
       with the introduction of genetically engineered food crops without
       further consultation with the community. I hasten to add this is
       why most States are probably introducing GE moratorium
       legislation. Surely that signals a lack of confidence in the Gene
       Technology Regulator's assessment process as well.
	   
<p>       The Greens will move an amendment to enshrine the Government's
       Advisory Council in legislation and ensure it has balanced
       representation and undertakes thorough community consultation in
       its deliberations and advice to the Minister. This will be an
       essential forum for ongoing debate over the next three years.
       While the Greens have serious reservations and do not support the
       introduction of genetically engineered food crops at all, we
       recognise that because gene technology has moved ahead at such an
       unbridled pace in New South Wales and Australia, it is vital that
       a rigorous and transparent regulatory regime is firmly in place.
       The Gene Technology (New South Wales) Bill formalises those
       arrangements between New South Wales and the Commonwealth Gene
       Technology Regulator and the operation of the national scheme in
       New South Wales. However, by adopting this mirror legislation we
       also inherit the shortcomings of the Commonwealth Gene Technology
       Act. The Greens will move amendments in the Committee stage to
       address some of the fundamental problems associated with the
       Commonwealth GE legislation. On 3 March the Premier announced in
       his press release that:
	   
<p>       Both farmers and environmentalists are concerned about the
       possible effects of planting GM food crops. I support the
       nationally consistent approach to the regulation of gene
       technology set up by the States and the Federal Government through
       the Gene Technology Act 2000. But it cannot be left to the Federal
       Gene Technology Regulator to approve these crops that can be
       released commercially in NSW.
	   
<p>       I wholeheartedly agree with the Government on this point. We must
       not give away our right to choose whether GE crops will be grown
       in New South Wales. Despite the stated position of New South Wales
       Farmers, any general release of GE canola should be postponed
       until all segregation and trade issues are addressed. They still
       argue for large-scale crop trials--up to 5,000 hectares, no
       less--to simulate commercialisation of GE canola. The Greens
       believe that such commercial trials would be a perversion of the
       concept of scientific and safety trials. It is no coincidence that
       the current application before the Gene Technology Regulator is
       for a 5,000-hectare commercial GE canola crop. This is a blatant
       attempt to rebrand a commercial application as a trial, to gain
       backdoor approval and open up an avenue to circumvent the
       Premier's promised moratorium.
	   
<p>       A moratorium in no uncertain terms is critical at this stage. Many
       powerful vested interests are pushing to have GE crops released in
       New South Wales. This was clearly indicated on the Insight
       investigation "Canola: Ready or not?" on SBS last week. It is
       evident that Monsanto's money is behind much of the so-called
       independent research on the benefits of GE crops. The company's
       fingerprints can be found all over so-called independent industry
       advisory bodies, such as Agrifood Awareness and AvCare. It even
       pays farmers to travel round the world espousing the dubious
       virtues of its products. It is terrible that Australia does not
       have independent, objective, scientific investigation undertaken
       by government so that it is free of the purse strings of industry.
       That is absolutely essential.
	   
<p>       The Hon. Rick Colless: Hear! Hear!
	   
<p>       Mr IAN COHEN: I appreciate the support for that concept by the
       Hon. Rick Colless of the Coalition. We have lost a lot when we
       lose such independent scientific investigation. We have already
       lost a lot through lack of Federal Government funding to support
       objective scientific research. The United States of America and
       Australia are currently discussing a free trade agreement that
       will involve Australia relaxing its regulation of GE crops and
       joining the United States of America in its opposition to the
       European Union's ban on GE food and crops. How much more blatant
       can it get? There is no market for GE food. No-one knowingly wants
       to buy it. Even starving African nations have refused it. So the
       United States bullies and their Australian followers of fashion
       want to create a market demand and force-feed the citizens of the
       world with their GE products against the will of those citizens.
       We have seen a precedent in the role that Australia has taken in
       the Middle East of following the United States. At least the
       Greens have consistently opposed that type of international
       political organisation and support for a superpower. That is not
       in the interests of Australia, and it is certainly not in the
       interests of the majority of Australians.
	   
<p>       Clearly, there is an urgent need for community participation and
       debate on the serious risks posed by GE food crops to our farmers
       and their markets, the environment and our health. There is a
       severe shortage of credible information on the benefits of GE
       crops but plenty of evidence to suggest that we should be
       extremely cautious. GE crops should not be given the benefit of
       the doubt. Nor should the New South Wales community be asked to
       wear the risks and costs associated with the trialling of
       high-risk gene technology products. Certainly, the economic and
       environmental disasters that have already occurred in other
       countries that grow genetically engineered crops, such as Canada,
       Argentina, China, Mexico and the United States of America, should
       sound alarm bells about the significant economic and environmental
       risks involved. The Government pointed to the problems in its 3
       March press release when it said:
	   
<p>       Following the introduction of GM canola in Canada, sales have
       significantly reduced. US corn is no longer sold to Europe and has
       lost market share in Asia.
	   
<p>       Even the United States Government is now admitting its farmers
       have lost billions of dollars in their markets. In 2001, for
       example, United States corn growers lost $US12 billion as a result
       of the Starlink corn disaster, which was essentially a failure of
       buffer zones--an issue that constantly raises its head in this
       debate--to stop the intermingling of GE and non-GE crops. A report
       of the United States Department of Agriculture's Economic Research
       Service in 2001 found no advantages to United States farmers
       growing GE crops and could not explain farmers' earlier ready
       acceptance of biotech industry promises. An article in The
       Ecologist of October 2002 titled "Why Argentina can't feed
       itself--How GM soya is destroying livelihoods and the environment"
       details the disastrous experience that country has had with GE
       soya beans giving lower yields, farmers using more pesticides
       because weeds have developed chemical resistance, and markets
       being lost because of the rejection of GE soya for human
       consumption. Argentina is going to spend $US200 million helping
       farmers revert to conventional crops.
	   
<p>       Monsanto itself is in rapid decline too, losing $US1.75 billion in
       the first nine months of 2002, compared with a profit of $US399
       million a year ago. Monsanto's sales have declined by 19 per cent
       and the company has cited a continued decline in Roundup sales in
       the United States and lower than expected sales in Argentina. The
       company has recently announced 700 job cuts, sacked its president
       and chief executive, because of the company's poor financial
       performance over the past few years. It would be a disaster for
       farmers to be involved with a company that is going down. Even the
       Deutsche Bank has declared "GE is dead" and has withdrawn its
       support for it.
	   
<p>       The GE industry and government agencies perpetuate the myth that
       once the community is provided with "independent" information
       about GE food, they will over time accept it, and markets will
       therefore open up. It is apparent, however, that the more informed
       the community is about genetic engineering, the more passionately
       it rejects genetic engineering. Underlying that rejection is a
       growing understanding about where power in this debate lies and
       how it is used. It is not about science; it is about the way in
       which corporate secrecy and self-interest have eroded public
       trust. The community is rightly uncomfortable with the separation
       of food from nature and the threat to democracy and social justice
       which is inherent in the concentration of power in the hands of a
       small number of global agribusiness corporations.
       Nor has the community fallen for the lie that GE will feed the
       world. The community understands that enough food is produced
       globally to feed the world's population and that a redistribution
       of resources is needed. The United Nations Food and Agriculture
       Organisation has published figures showing that the world's
       starving people could be fed without the use of a single
       genetically engineered grain. Despite this, USAID has launched a
       $US100 million program to bring biotechnology to developing
       countries, because it is United States firms that stand to benefit
       the most from such deals. Frankly, the community is turning away
       in their droves from industrially produced food. They are seeking
       organic, locally produced food that supports farmers and looks
       after the land, limiting any further environmental destruction.
	   
<p>       Organic food is the fastest growing segment of American
       agriculture. According to the United States Organic Consumers
       Association, on current estimates, most of the $US360 billion in
       food sold at the retail level in the United States will be organic
       by the year 2020. In Europe the organic market is growing even
       more rapidly and spectacularly. Farmers in 130 nations are growing
       certified organic food, yet only a handful are growing GE crops on
       a commercial scale. Over 35 countries, including substantial
       export customers in Europe and Asia, have legislation controlling
       GE commodity imports. I think we would be backing the wrong horse
       if we make concessions for GE. Instead, let us see some serious
       commitment to genuine sustainable agriculture in New South Wales,
       the sort of agriculture that is being demanded by the community
       all over the world.
	   
<p>       We do not need GE food crops, and we will not be isolating
       ourselves from technology that can improve yields, disease
       resistance, improve soil, reduce pesticides and address
       environmental problems such as salinity if we ban GE crops. At any
       rate, GE crops do not address fundamental environmental problems.
       They maintain the status quo at best, and at worst will exacerbate
       problems and create new ones. Interestingly, earlier I spoke in
       the House with the Hon. Rick Colless about increased productivity
       and yields that can follow the application of proper scientific
       measures, while improving the quality of soils through regular
       crop processes. It has been proven that spending the appropriate
       quantity of time and energy on scientific investigation, with a
       view to creating a proper balance in our soils, will enhance crop
       production. That is a matter on which I would like to continue
       talking with the National Party about, because in that way from
       the bottom up we can help people on the land to be more productive
       and get the most out of their land without destroying it. The Hon.
       Rick Colless made a valid point. It is clear, with his background
       in soil science, that success in the rural sector can be achieved
       without adopting genetic engineering.
	   
<p>       The Hon. Duncan Gay: You are giving all this praise to the
       National Party branches on his behalf.
	   
<p>       Mr IAN COHEN: Certainly, and it is given where it is deserved. The
       honourable member knows that I will not stand on politics. When
       people say the right thing I support it, and I always have. I even
       support the Minister when he says the right thing.
	   
<p>       The Hon. Rick Colless: That wouldn't happen very often.
	   
<p>       Mr IAN COHEN: We will see. Dr Les Levidow, a United Kingdom
       research fellow at the Open University, has published several
       papers on risk assessment of gene technology products. Recently he
       was invited by Australia's premier research organisation, the
       CSIRO, to give advice about the application of the precautionary
       principle in genetically modified organism [GMO] risk assessment.
       Dr Levidow argues that in the case of genetically engineered crops
       it is important to know what counts as serious or irreversible
       damage. The national scheme in Australia accepts that risks will
       be associated with the release of GMOs in the environment, and
       proposes that these risks will be managed. Dr Levidow says that,
       in the assessment of those risks, it is critical to ask: What is
       the baseline it is being compared to? In the case of GE crops, for
       example, the approach to risk assessment is to exclude from
       consideration any problems that are already caused by the non-GE
       versions of the same crop.
	   
<p>       This approach accepts as the baseline problems such as pest or
       weed resistance, reliance on synthetic input, soil degradation,
       salinity and loss of biodiversity, which provides a relatively
       favourable comparison for any GE crop that may offer short-term
       improvements to some problems. The result of this approach in the
       long term, however, only further entrenches agricultural problems
       and makes farmers even more dependent on expensive technology and
       slaves to the spiralling costs of that technology and artificial
       inputs. It would be far more realistic and useful to compare GE
       crops to agricultural practices that address environmental
       problems and seek to improve on past practices by addressing soil
       nutrition and adopting holistic approaches to pest and disease
       management, for example. GE crops may not look so favourable under
       these circumstances.
	   
<p>       In Austria and Denmark, where there is a policy to expand organic
       agriculture, GE crops have been found to compare less favourably
       than in countries comparing GE crops to conventional agriculture.
       Genetic modification of crops also makes it possible to extend
       growing into new areas such as drought or salt-affected areas.
       Although some may say this is a benefit because more land becomes
       productively useful, it could also be argued that extending the
       environmental damage associated with agriculture into new and
       vulnerable areas certainly will not address the underlying
       environmental problems inherent in that type of agriculture. Dr
       Levidow said that the European Union risk assessment process took
       into account the impact of such extension of crops into new areas,
       and that Europe was now looking at more stringent comparators than
       simply the most chemically intensive farming methods to make their
       assessments of GE crops.
	   
<p>       The interpretation of the precautionary principle is full of
       opportunities for scientific and public discussion, but government
       and policymakers rarely open up such debates. Instead, fundamental
       judgments about what should count as damage that should be
       prevented and whether the scientific evidence is adequate to make
       judgments about such potential damage are often concealed under
       the banner of sound science, which is used often as a political
       slogan to silence doubts about safety. It is fundamentally
       misleading about the role of value judgments in science, and
       places the strongest burden of evidence on those concerned about
       risk.
	   
<p>       Licensed applicants generate a great deal of so-called objective
       science that is provided to the Office of the Gene Technology
       Regulator. This is totally unacceptable in this context and would
       not be accepted in many other contexts. The Greens have long said
       that we want to see the same sort of controls and understanding of
       the development of genetically engineered products that exists
       with medical products. We have said consistently that we would
       like to see trials in the hothouse. The control and care taken
       with the medical development of gene technology, which is widely
       used and not objected to by the Greens, is the type of scrutiny we
       need.
	   
<p>       The Hon. Dr Arthur Chesterfield-Evans: I would like to believe
       that the medical experimentation was married to an objective.
	   
<p>       Mr IAN COHEN: I take the point, but comparatively far greater
       scrutiny is placed on the medical development of gene technology
       than currently exists in the agricultural sector, and that is
       rather worrying. It is also telling that the objectives of the
       Commonwealth Gene Technology Act do not contain ecologically
       sustainable development, and the chosen definition of the
       precautionary principle is watered down to suit industry needs and
       is at odds with the definition of the precautionary principle in
       the New South Wales legislation. This inconsistency was identified
       by the standing committee inquiry. The Greens will move an
       amendment to the Gene Technology (New South Wales) Bill to address
       this inconsistency in the definitions. It is alarming that
       universities throughout Australia are issuing directives to
       departments to steer their research towards genetic engineering to
       attract funding. It is atrocious and cuts off another avenue for
       independent research.
	   
<p>       Recently Syngenta, a major biotech player, terminated a research
       partnership with the University of California. Biotech companies
       are pulling out of research contracts all over the globe. I hope
       that universities are not relying on this funding support for too
       long. Last year the Greens hosted a forum on genetically
       engineered crops and food. Luke Anderson, author and international
       speaker on genetic engineering, gave an informative presentation
       about the international context of GM food and crops, and this
       presentation only deepened our concerns. It was pointed out that,
       as with other agricultural products, research on the possible
       environmental consequences of introducing technology lags far
       behind the development of engineered varieties. As we have found
       from experience with some exotic plant species that were
       introduced into ornamental gardens before the beginning of this
       century and have only recently spread into the wild, it can take
       well over 100 years for the ecological effects of introducing new
       types of plants to become apparent.
	   
<p>       GE raises complex scientific, health, medical, political and
       ethical issues that have not been debated adequately in the
       community. It poses a serious risk to public health, the
       environment and our markets. It also has serious legal
       ramifications and economic implications. The Greens are concerned
       that members are being asked to make important decisions about the
       future application of gene technology in the absence of objective
       information and without adequate legal advice. No avenues are
       available for the public to be meaningfully engaged in a debate in
       New South Wales. I urge members to at least support the Greens
       amendment to the GE advisory council. The Government emphasises
       that the Gene Technology (New South Wales) Bill is part of a joint
       Commonwealth-State approach to the regulation of genetically
       engineered organisms.
	   
<p>       However, the subject matter of the bill is primarily a State
       issue. The bill is not based on any clear Commonwealth
       constitutional power. It relies upon power given to the
       Commonwealth by the State. New South Wales policy on GE should not
       be determined in accordance with the dictates of the Commonwealth:
       the people through their elected representatives in this
       Parliament should decide. The State Government should ensure that
       an appropriate regulatory framework is in place to safeguard the
       environment and interests of the people of New South Wales. The
       interim report of the Standing Committee on State Development on
       genetically modified food identified more than 17 substantive
       issues that need further investigation.
	   
<p>       The committee established that it would further research the
       implications of genetically modified food on international trade,
       and that would include examination of potential costs and benefits
       to New South Wales on export markets in relation to either
       restricting or facilitating the production of genetically modified
       food. The committee also undertook to examine the rights and
       responsibilities of producers of genetically modified food
       products in relation to the community, as well as producers of
       non-genetically modified food products. In particular, the
       committee undertook to investigate the implications of the gene
       technology regulatory framework for State government, local
       government and community interests.
	   
<p>       None of this has occurred, yet we are being asked basically to
       give the go-ahead to GE in New South Wales by passing the Gene
       Technology (New South Wales) Bill on the one hand, and by
       introducing some tentative arrangements for a potential moratorium
       on the other hand with the Gene Technology (GM Crop Moratorium)
       Bill. Although the Commonwealth Gene Technology Act 2000
       establishes the national regulatory scheme for gene technology and
       is a far better arrangement than the previous voluntary scheme,
       New South Wales and other States will adopt fundamentally flawed
       legislation and a resulting national scheme.
	   
<p>       There is an opportunity to amend this bill and that opportunity
       should be taken to address the shortcomings of the Commonwealth
       Act as it applies to New South Wales law and the shortcomings of
       the national scheme as it applies to this State. During debate on
       the Commonwealth legislation, Labor members, Democrats and Greens
       raised concerns about the serious deficiencies in the bill. For
       example, in Senator Forshaw's second reading speech he stated,
       when referring to the Commonwealth-State Senate Reference
       Committee Inquiry into Gene Technology:
	   
<p>       Of the 130 public submissions to the Inquiry there was not much
       support of the bill nor the scheme from the public.
	   
<p>       The New South Wales public is similarly concerned about the
       adoption of this bill. Members of the crossbench and Opposition
       have had discussions with representatives of concerned organic and
       conventional farmers from country areas of New South Wales,
       particularly with respect to proposals for introducing GE canola.
       There has been a complete failure by this Government to consult
       with the farming community on the potential impacts of introducing
       GE canola, which has been identified by the European Environment
       Agency as a high-risk crop that is likely to lead to
       cross-contamination. Senator Forshaw also raised concerns about
       the serious nature of the decisions that the Office of the Gene
       Technology Regulator has to make--decisions that in some cases
       will have major health, safety and environmental ramifications and
       that will place a huge responsibility of the office as well as the
       regulator. Labor proposed at that time that the office be
       structured in a very different way, with three persons rather than
       a single statutory office holder. Of course, that proposal was
       rejected.
	   
<p>       The point I make is that the independence of the regulator is
       critical if the public is ever to develop any confidence in the
       regulatory regime and indeed the technology. Greens amendments
       that will be moved at the Committee stage will address the problem
       of the extensive discretionary powers of the regulator. In
       addition to the independence of the regulator, one of the major
       concerns raised in the Federal inquiry's public hearings was the
       need for assurance that the objects of the legislation, namely,
       the protection of human health and safety and the environment,
       will be met. Some key directions must be given to the regulator
       about the accepted definition of the precautionary principle and
       how the principle should be applied when considering licence
       applications and other dealings with genetically modified
       organisms. The community has raised its concerns about various
       aspects of the bill. For example, as it stands the bill will allow
       only applicants to appeal against decisions of the regulator in
       the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Not allowing third parties a
       right of appeal regarding decisions of the regulator is both
       discriminatory and against the principles of natural justice.
	   
<p>       Other crossbench members will be moving amendments in Committee
       that will provide for third party appeal rights in both procedure
       and merit. Federal Labor amendments to the Commonwealth bill
       proposed that licence applications should be reviewed by the
       statutory community consultative committee, not just the technical
       advisory committee--which is the current arrangement. The Greens
       amendment will require the regulator to consult with the community
       consultative committee and the ethics committee in respect of
       every application, ensuring that the requirement for transparency
       of the process is upheld. It will also ensure that the views of
       the broader community, as reflected in the community and ethics
       committees, will be taken into consideration during the risk
       assessment process for licence applications. Honourable members
       will be interested to know that the latest communique from the
       community consultative committee dated 20 February 2003 states:
	   
<p>       The CTCCC expresses concern that a state of community unreadiness
       exists concerning the risk to the environment and the commercial
       release of GM canola, so significant that the applications should
       be declined at this time.
	   
<p>       Federal Labor's amendments also flag the issue of liability and
       insurance. The Commonwealth Gene Technology Act does not require
       licence holders to have insurance. It is beyond belief that, given
       the level of risk involved in gene technology and the potential
       for harm, insurance is not mandatory. Perhaps insurance cannot be
       made mandatory because insurers will not insure against the risks
       involved with GE crops for the reason that they cannot quantify
       the risks, and the risks are likely to be too great. It is a
       complete contradiction, therefore, that the foundation of the Gene
       Technology Regulator's assessment of applications is an assessment
       of risks and risk management. It is crucial that the risks in
       introducing genetically engineered crops in New South Wales are
       thoroughly assessed. There is already clear evidence that there
       have been disasters in other countries such as Canada where there
       is a widespread contamination of non-GE crops, and where farmers
       have suffered losses as a result. There are also very clear
       signals from the market that some people do not want to buy GE
       produce. Genetic engineering is such that once the genie is let
       out of the bottle, there is no turning back. It would be far wiser
       and more sustainable in the long term to support the GE-free
       farmers and certified organic farmers, who currently cannot supply
       enough of their produce to a world market that is clamouring for
       clean, green and GE-free produce.
	   
<p>       New Zealand and Tasmania have the right idea. They are protecting
       their clean, green and GE-free status for which they will reap
       financial rewards while at the same time they protect the
       environment. However the therapeutic application of gene
       technology is a very different issue that raises different
       questions and requires a separate debate. There are perhaps more
       defensible arguments for the continuation of research in that
       field. There needs to be extensive public debate to work through
       community concerns. The debate about GE food and crops has been
       obscured and confused by discussing these two major applications
       of gene technology as if the issues were the same. They are
       clearly different and raise different scientific, ethical and
       community concerns. As admitted by the industry itself, clients
       for these two sectors are completely different and the issues
       involved in the application of the technology require completely
       different management.
	   
<p>       Before proceeding any further I wish to define what I mean by
       genetic engineering as it applies to crops, as there is a common
       misconception that plant breeding and genetic engineering are one
       and the same thing. The argument is that plant breeding has been
       conducted for many years, so what is the big deal about genetic
       engineering? Plant breeding and genetic engineering are different
       and the perpetuation of misinformation serves only to illustrate
       the level of ignorance about the science behind GE and the
       pathetic deception by the proponents of GE.
	   
<p>       The Hon. Dr Arthur Chesterfield-Evans: It helps the big boys.
	   
<p>       Mr IAN COHEN: Indeed. Genetic engineering forces genetic material
       from wildly different species--plants, animals, viruses, bacteria
       and even human beings--into the genome of plants and animals. GE
       bypasses the normal regulatory mechanisms inherent in natural
       breeding processes within a species. The application of GE to
       create genetically engineered organisms breaches species barriers,
       disregarding each species' unique genetic make-up--for example,
       putting fish genes into tomatoes. Meanwhile, a paradigm shift is
       occurring in genetics with the central dogma being a linear model
       of cell functioning that no longer fits the facts. In an article
       published in the Australian Financial Review on 1 March 2002
       eminent biologist Professor Barry Commoner argued that one gene
       can give rise to multiple proteins--a fact confirmed by the human
       genome project--which essentially destroys the theoretical
       foundation of the genetic engineering industry. Professor Commoner
       warns that this information should compel regulators and
       governments to reassess the safety of genetic engineering using a
       revised model of complex genetic and protein systems. He rejects
       industry and government assurances that GE is science based and
       safe, because the testing assessments are fundamentally flawed.
	   
<p>       The process of gene insertion is random and imprecise and can give
       rise to unexpected and unpredictable effects. Such was the case
       recorded in the journal Nature in 1998, which reported on the
       discovery that GE herbicide resistance mustard plants were found
       to be 20 times more likely to outcross than the same plant with a
       conventionally introduced mutation. That was not an isolated
       instance. The danger of using viral and bacterial genes in GE was
       revealed in an experiment by Australian scientists at the
       Australian National University. Scientists who were trying to
       develop a mouse contraceptive engineered a protein into a mousepox
       virus. The result was unpredictable. Unexpectedly the scientists
       had created a deadly virus that killed 100 per cent of the mice
       used in the experiment. Not only did it kill mice without immunity
       to the mousepox virus but also 50 per cent of mice with immunity
       to mousepox as well. In other words, it was able to bypass the
       immune system of mice.
	   
<p>       The main problem of the bill is that it places the onus upon the
       community to prove that GE is unsafe. This is an unfair and
       impossible task. The technology is completely unproven and the
       community should not carry the risks associated with that
       technology. It is impossible for it to be proved unsafe; equally,
       it is impossible for it to be proved safe. This is the key problem
       with GE. There is no doubt that it carries a risk that the extent
       of the risk is unknown and unpredictable. Many independent
       scientists are warning that GE foods introduce new risks because
       of the potential for new allergenic, toxic and carcinogenic
       compounds that they may create in foods. Let us not forget the 37
       people killed by the GE L-tryptophan dietary supplements in 1987
       and more recently reports of allergic reactions to tortilla chips
       that tested positive to StarLink corn. StarLink corn was only
       intended for non-human consumption. However, it begs the question,
       what harm is it doing to animals? How is it that we have foods on
       our shelves and crops growing in our fields that pose such risks?
       On 14 November 2001 in this House the Hon. Tony Kelly, who is now
       the Minister for Rural Affairs, said:
	   
<p>       We need a system akin to the process of safety and efficacy
       assurances required of new drugs.
	   
<p>       I am inclined to agree, but currently the community is subjected
       to a massive experiment, against its will and choice, and is
       literally force-fed genetically modified foods on a safe until
       proved unsafe philosophy. Policies such as this have proved to be
       a disaster historically. One has only to look at the blind-eye
       approach taken to exposure to asbestos and the dangers of smoking
       to realise that that is a very stupid approach to the regulation
       of genetically engineered food. All the warning signs are here
       now. A precautionary approach should be adopted to this technology
       so we do not have a repeat of such significant and preventable
       disasters. It is a flawed scientific premise that genetically
       engineered food is substantially equivalent to other food and
       introduces no greater risk. The basis for that claim has been that
       the amount of new genetic material introduced is very small and
       poses no risk.
	   
<p>       Proper application of the scientific method requires that
       researchers should assume that GE food is substantially different
       from other food and is unsafe, and set about proving otherwise.
       Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. It has also
       transpired that because the GE industry cannot keep its GE
       material from contaminating other crops the definition of
       "GE-free" now means that food can contain 1 per cent GE
       contamination. That is truly outrageous and inappropriate. When I
       buy something that claims to be 100 per cent gluten free, I expect
       that the product is 100 per cent gluten free. However, if I buy
       food labelled "GE free", the food could have 1 per cent GE
       contamination. No studies have been done to prove the long-term
       safety of GE products. That approach has been severely criticised
       by scientific groups, including the European Union/US
       Biotechnology Consultative Forum in its report of December 2000
       and the Canadian Royal Society. Both groups have called for more
       extensive testing to prove safety and have highlighted the need
       for mandatory comprehensive labelling so adverse effects can be
       traced.
	   
<p>       The Australian Government has commissioned a three-year CSIRO
       study into the ecological effects of GE crops, but evidence has
       emerged overseas and in Australia of detrimental effects to soil
       ecology and non-target insects from genetically engineered crops
       with built-in pesticides. Beneficial insects such as bees are
       affected by GE pollen. In 1999 in the House of Commons Michael
       Meacher, the United Kingdom environment Minister, stated:
	   
<p>       [Despite precautions] it has to be recognised that bee activity
       may in some cases involve the dissemination of GE pollen beyond
       the isolation distances used.
	   
<p>       It has since been shown in farm-scale GE trials that bees can
       carry pollen up to 10 kilometres from test sites. That illustrates
       that buffer zones in GE management plans are practically useless,
       especially for open pollinated crops such as canola. It would be
       virtually impossible to maintain a GE-free canola industry in New
       South Wales if GE canola is commercially released in this State.
       One claim made about GE crops is that they require fewer chemicals
       because they can be engineered to withstand herbicides and
       pesticides. For example, industry claims that Roundup Ready soya
       beans are an environmentally friendly crop, but there is
       considerable evidence that plants are developing resistance to GE
       crops and that such crops require increased use of chemicals.
       Certainly that was the case in Argentina. During the crossbench
       briefing, Juliet McFarlane from the Network of Concerned Farmers
       told members that canola growers may even have to start using
       2,4-D again to kill volunteer Roundup Ready canola in between
       cropping cycles. That would negate any savings on pesticide use
       and would reintroduce a more hazardous pesticide.
	   
<p>       The data provided by the biotech industry on pesticide savings in
       canola is based on the Canadian experience. Canada does not have a
       problem with volunteers simply because of snow during the winter
       months. Australia, however, is a completely different proposition.
       Target insect pests are developing resistance to the Bt toxin
       engineered in cotton, and this is forcing farmers to use more
       pesticides on the crops. This defeats the whole purpose of
       genetically engineered crops that were designed to reduce
       pesticide and herbicide use. In order to compensate for the
       resistance, farmers now must allocate more of their land to insect
       refuges to prevent resistance developing. Scientists claim they
       can prevent further resistance happening by engineering even more
       potent Bt genes into cotton. Where does this end? Bt is a
       relatively low toxic and useful pesticide, but its useful life is
       shortened by its use in cotton.
	   
<p>       Herbicide resistance is another major problem, with weeds and
       volunteer crops already developing resistance to the chemicals.
       For example, in Canada a nine-point management plan has had to be
       introduced to control herbicide resistance in canola. Ryegrass in
       Australia is already proving to be resistant to some herbicides.
       How long before broad-scale herbicide resistance occurs in New
       South Wales? If we pretend it will not happen to us, we are surely
       being extremely naÃ¯ve. Genetically engineered canola is being
       trialled in many secret locations across New South Wales and there
       is a high risk of contamination of conventional canola from these
       crops grown for so-called experimental and seed purposes. A large
       proportion of canola trial crops are apparently grown to supply
       the overseas market with bulk GE-canola seed. It is unacceptable
       that those secret trials have been established under the guise of
       experimentation and carried out without the public's knowledge for
       what is essentially already apparently a commercial enterprise.
	   
<p>       The proponents of GE claim that it promises significant benefits
       for consumers. The Greens say that any potential benefits are far
       outweighed by the potential risks. GE results in less choice for
       consumers because of the potential for widespread contamination of
       conventional crops and potential loss of GE-free and certified
       organic markets. There is no method of guaranteeing the
       segregation of GE and non-GE crops. The result is that the
       community loses the ability to make a choice and is force-fed GE
       against their will and knowledge. Despite the promised benefits of
       GE, it is being rejected by consumers worldwide. As a result,
       markets for GE produce are shrinking and the markets for
       sustainably produced foods are growing. Organic markets are
       growing at 40 to 60 per cent annually; Japan will pay a premium
       for GE-free soybeans and the European Union wants more GE-free
       produce than we can possibly produce.
	   
<p>       The introduction by stealth of GE crops also exposes farmers to
       litigation by the corporation that owns the seed, as in the
       notorious case of Canadian farmer Percy Schmeiser, who was sued by
       Monsanto for growing their GE canola seed, even though he had
       never purchased seed from the company. His crop was contaminated
       by seeds and pollen from neighbouring crops. Farmers who
       participate in GE crop trials can be compromised if they wish to
       grow non-GE crops at a later stage. For instance, canola
       volunteers can lie dormant for between 6 and 10 years depending on
       the variety and can reappear in farmers' fields, as occurred in
       Tasmania, much to the alarm of farmers. It was reported in the
       April-May 2002 edition of Acres Australia, the national newspaper
       for sustainable agriculture, that the latest audit carried out by
       the Commonwealth Department of Primary Industries, Water and the
       Environment in conjunction with the Office of the Gene Technology
       Regulator, of former trial sites for genetically engineered crops
       has revealed seven sites with evidence of flowering GE plants that
       have volunteered after the site was apparently cleaned up.
	   
<p>       Contamination of farmland in this manner has the potential to
       affect the value and usability of land in the future. That concern
       was also expressed by the Chartered Institute of Surveyors in the
       United Kingdom, which warned that certain farms and even regions
       could become stigmatised for their GE status. Certainly, if one
       looks at the very rudimentary maps on the regulator's web site it
       is clear that Wagga Wagga is the GE capital of New South Wales at
       this stage. If GE contamination occurred on the North Coast, it
       could devastate the viable organic producers in that area who have
       reinvented themselves after dairy deregulation. Are we willing to
       jeopardise this viable new industry? Segregation of GE and non-GE
       crops is likely to be impossible and the costs to farmers for
       segregation and identity preservation would far exceed any cost
       savings from growing GE crops. A study on genetically modified
       grains funded by the Grains Research and Development Corporation
       published by ABARE in 2001 stated:
	   
<p>       There is now a substantial literature on the cost of segregation
       and identity preservation to do with GM grain. The literature
       generally suggests, for a mixed production system of conventional
       and GM grain, that identity preservation in terms of certifying
       non-GM status adds 5-15% to the cost of the grain delivery.
	   
<p>       The same study reports that the Federal Government is now spending
       $3.65 million of taxpayers' money to establish a program to assess
       the requirements and costs of segregating products developed with
       gene technology and to ensure that those products can be traced
       through to their origins. Why is the community paying to pave an
       easy way forward for the Monsanto and Bayer crop scientists of
       this world? The Network of Concerned Farmers has been trying to
       get figures on the costs of growing GE canola, but none are
       forthcoming. It cannot even get results from the 200 GE canola
       trial crops in New South Wales. It has tried to work out its own
       figures and it has calculated that it will cost approximately $80
       extra per hectare to grow GE canola.
	   
<p>       The Starlink corn disaster in the United States of America showed
       how a lack of segregation can lead to health risks and cost
       farmers their markets. Starlink corn was approved only for animal
       feed but it became mixed up with food that was destined for human
       consumption. It contaminated the human food chain, resulting in
       billions of dollars in recalled products. The cost to our farmers
       and manufacturers is ongoing. That episode highlights the
       inability of segregation to prevent contamination. At our
       crossbench briefing yesterday Juliet McFarlane from the Network of
       Concerned Farmers talked about some of the mistakes that occur
       when farmers are handling such vast quantities of grain. One type
       of grain could be put in the wrong hopper and unloaded from these
       massive machines. She referred also to shandying it down to make
       its protein content acceptable.
	   
<p>       Those are the sorts of mistakes that can occur on farms when
       massive harvesting operations are in process. The protein content
       in GE crops cannot be corrected, so we could be faced with great
       losses if mistakes are made in the handling and transport of these
       grains. Trials of GE crops producing pharmaceutical plastics and
       industrial enzymes are next on the GE agenda and threaten the
       security of our food supply. How would we manage if crops grown
       for an acute medical problem ended up in crops destined for our
       general food supply? What would be the consequences to soil
       ecology and what remediation measures would be required? Can we
       afford to use valuable agricultural land for industrial purposes?
       That is especially relevant to Australia as we face increasing
       degradation of our land from salinity and soil loss.
	   
<p>       Since the introduction of genetically engineered crops in 1996
       United States agricultural exports have declined 15 per cent. Our
       major trading partner, Japan, is demanding GE-free produce. Korea
       will not accept United States GE corn. Canadian farmers have asked
       the Government not to approve GE wheat for fear of losing their
       market to Australia's GE-free wheat. Major supermarket chains in
       the United Kingdom and Europe, and even in the United States, are
       eliminating GE products on their shelves. They also demand food
       sourced from animals that are fed a GE-free diet. Are we
       segregating GE cotton trash so that it does not end up in animal
       feed? What would our significant trading partner, Japan, do if
       Australian cattle were being fed GE food? Japan is still nervous
       about mad cow disease and it is sensitive to these issues. At a
       presentation to the Australian Institute of Health, Law and Ethics
       last year, Gary Goldberg, Chief Executive Officer of the American
       Corn Growers Foundation, said--
	   
<p>       The Hon. Ian Macdonald: GE residual canola is licensed for sale in
       Japan as a food for animals and for oil imports.
	   
<p>       Mr IAN COHEN: I remain firmly unconvinced about the oil issue
       raised by the Minister. The cotton that is grown in New South
       Wales essentially is seen as a non-food product, but it ends up as
       blended oil. I have asked questions in the House about that issue,
       but I have not received an answer.
	   
<p>       [Interruption]
	   
<p>       I believe the Minister was talking about canola. These products,
       which are subsequently included in oils, become lost on the
       general market. In many cases these products are then consumed by
       humans, which highlights the global style of marketing that is
       occurring. It is easy for contaminated products to be included in
       food that is destined for human consumption. These products should
       also be properly labelled--another major problem in this area of
       genetically engineered food. Gary Goldberg, Chief Executive
       Officer of the American Corn Growers Foundation, said:
	   
<p>       So what have genetically modified organisms done for the American
       farmer? They have made us liable for pollen contamination from
       other farms, forced us to segregate our GMO from non-GMO crops,
       diminished our export markets, made our customers lose faith in
       the ability of US farmers to provide the products they demand,
       increased corporate concentration within the seed industry and
       have cost the American farmer billions of dollars through lower
       commodity process. All this in the name of science.
	   
<p>       It is not surprising that some countries are now choosing to go
       completely GE free. Even though the European Union has lifted its
       ban on GE crops, individual countries have maintained their
       GE-free policies and enforced them. Ireland, Denmark and Germany
       have frozen GE crop trials and experiments. Sri Lanka, Cuba and
       Thailand ban GE food. There has been a great deal of one-sided
       debate about this complex issue.
	   
<p>       I thank those who helped to prepare my speech and the Greens
       amendments that will be moved in Committee. Jeni Emblem, a former
       staffer of Richard Jones, and Richard Jones, who is visiting the
       Parliament, have done a wonderful job preparing my speech. I am
       fortunate to have Richard Jones assisting me with this
       legislation. Jo Immig, a former staffer of Alan Corbett, is
       passionately concerned about genetically engineered food. I
       appreciate the support of all those people and I thank them for
       preparing material that I have been able to use in debate and that
       will be used later in Committee. I believe that I have a fairly
       balanced view, but many honourable members might disagree.
       Honourable members should be aware that this issue, which will
       have a massive impact on agriculture in New South Wales, should be
       treated seriously.
	   
<p>       The Hon. Dr ARTHUR CHESTERFIELD-EVANS [3.47 p.m.]: I enter debate
       on the Gene Technology (New South Wales) Bill by expressing my
       concern as I do not believe that the Federal and State governments
       have treated this legislation with the gravity that is warranted.
       The Commonwealth Gene Technology Act 2000 was the origin of the
       Gene Technology (New South Wales) Bill, which was first introduced
       in 2001. That bill adopted or applied the principles contained in
       the Commonwealth legislation as the gene technology area had been
       fairly ad hoc and directionless. There is no argument that this
       area must be regulated but we do not know whether the present
       Commonwealth legislation and the New South Wales bill are
       adequate.
	   
<p>       The Australian Democrats' position on gene technology is that
       genetically modified organisms [GMOs] require effective isolation
       risk management and independent assessment before their
       environmental release. Over the past 10 years a number of field
       trials have been conducted in a number of States. It has been
       difficult to find the location of those trials as the obligation
       to inform the public or even neighbouring landowners was
       non-existent. It is an appalling situation as the effect on the
       ecosystem of an area was not evaluated and the effect on
       neighbouring crops of the non-GM variety of a similar species was
       not considered.
	   
<p>       There are a number of major concerns: segregation of GM crops and
       non-GM crops in silo storage, contract harvesters travelling from
       farm to farm, and the decontamination of machines. The Australian
       Democrats' Federal policy calls for an environmental impact
       assessment of all GMOs as per the Environmental Protection and
       Biodiversity Conservation Act. The environment Minister must
       approve all GMOs for environmental release. GMOs require effective
       isolation, risk management and independent assessment before their
       environmental release. It is imperative that risks are both
       understood and minimised. That means significant ongoing research
       and an appropriate regulatory environment. The Democrats do not
       oppose every aspect or application of genetic technology and its
       potential benefits. We recognise that States have differing
       industry bases and market advantages and we support an individual
       State's choice to promote GM-free industries statewide via an
       opt-out provision in the Gene Technology Act 2000.
	   
<p>       The Australian Democrats fought hard to secure improvements under
       the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council labelling regime
       for genetically modified foods. Under the new regime, labels are
       required when modified DNA and/or proteins are present in the
       final product and the food has altered characteristics. However,
       the labelling requirements do not go far enough. We support
       labelling for highly refined foods such as oil made from modified
       corn, even though there is no modified DNA or protein in the final
       product; for all food using GM processing aids and additives; for
       foods using GM flavours, even if they are less than 0.1 per cent
       of the final product; for takeaway and restaurant food that uses
       GM ingredients and is prepared at the point of sale; and for all
       foods from 7 December 2001, including those long-life products
       already on supermarket shelves.
	   
<p>       My Federal colleague Senator John Cherry has highlighted the
       conflict that New South Wales in particular and Australia as a
       whole may have with the United States of America, which has
       challenged the European Union's GM crop ban. I have given notice
       of a motion regarding our trade in primary products with the
       United States, which cannot be assumed to act for our
       interests--indeed, America is our rival in many trade areas. It
       would be extremely convenient for the United States, which has
       lost its GM status, if we were to lose our GM status also as we
       would then be forced to take its side against the Europeans and
       attempt to force GM products onto European markets. If Australia
       remains GM free we will continue to have a marketing advantage
       over the United States, and it would be in the Americans' best
       interests to remove that advantage.
	   
<p>       The research issue has interested me for some time. Years ago
       research was conducted by interested amateurs, who fought against
       the establishment in the days when the church controlled all
       things. Galileo was told that he would be burnt at the stake if he
       did not recant and withdraw his support for the view of Copernicus
       that the Earth revolved around the sun. His research, which was
       privately funded, was not supported by the state. Then came a
       phase when the state funded research, and beneficial products such
       as penicillin were made freely available to the entire community.
       There was an attempt in the United States at one time to patent
       the use of anaesthetics--which were probably discovered in
       Scotland but that assertion is disputed. As a result of the
       ensuing dispute anaesthetics in the United States were of a lesser
       quality than those in Britain and Australia for some time. That
       technology should have been universally available yet the desire
       to patent intellectual property in order to make money denied the
       public its benefits for a long period.
	   
<p>       Drugs and vaccinations have become extremely expensive. The battle
       between patenting intellectual property for profit and acting in
       the public interest is becoming acute in many areas. We should
       consider some salient historical examples. The harmful effects of
       tobacco on health is the most studied subject in the history of
       science. Yet the industry denied the research, forced the repeat
       of studies and fought the findings at a political level. I believe
       it is still holding out against that research. Indeed, this
       Parliament has been supine on the issue, bowing to political
       pressure and failing to proclaim the smoke-free environments
       legislation. In other words, the Government did not, and does not,
       listen to science.
	   
<p>       The Government venally--and for reasons that are incomprehensible
       to anyone with the slightest interest in public health and
       welfare--ignores scientific evidence and bows to pressure from the
       tobacco industry. The New South Wales Parliament has a very
       un-proud history in this area, and both major parties have behaved
       abominably. The tobacco industry has demonstrated that it is
       totally without ethics by lying systematically for two
       generations--and the lies continue today. The pharmaceutical
       industry fares little better in a discussion about corporate
       ethics. As a doctor, I was a target for its propaganda for some
       years.
	   
<p>       I watched the effects of the industry's marketing tactics during
       my days with Billboard-Utilising Graffitists Against Unhealthy
       Promotions [BUGA-UP], when I took an interest in the ethics of
       advertising and of corporations, using the tobacco industry as a
       model. Increasingly, professors who conduct research depend upon
       grants, as do their large departments. Researchers are flown
       around the world and hailed as experts, and multinational
       companies facilitate their research papers. If their conclusions
       are not favourable to the drug company their research grants are
       stopped at the stroke of a pen, their staff disappear, their
       prestige vanishes and they can no longer travel overseas. As a
       consequence, researchers have difficulty claiming independence.
	   
<p>       This battle is being fought in the medical field. The Government
       allocates fewer and fewer funds to independent research and the
       national research effort has been hijacked by the Wills report's
       references to joint development and trials--all designed to make
       money and thus free the Government from funding independent
       research. In the face of cargo cult like demands that every
       research effort must show a profit, researchers think they are
       clever if they can link with a commercial organisation to gain
       expertise, enter the marketplace and make money. However, they
       then lose the ability to evaluate their findings impartially and
       free themselves from the market. As a consequence, their fate is
       regulatory capture.
	   
<p>       As university funding becomes more marginal, these institutions
       must seek funds from sources other than government and students.
       One solution is sponsored chairs, and the quid pro quo for
       sponsoring a chair is the use of products and technologies from
       the company sponsor. Some years ago I attended, as an expert on
       tobacco control, the annual meeting of the Atheroma Society of New
       Zealand, a small society that specialised in arterial disease. The
       entire weekend workshop was sponsored by the manufacturer of a new
       drug, and the key-note speaker was flown from the United States to
       the conference in Dunedin. He had conducted sponsored research of
       the drug that prevented atheroma--the blocking of arteries--and
       claimed that it was a wonder drug. Doctors who attended the
       meeting subsequently prescribed the drug widely.
	   
<p>       They became leaders in their field, which led to an explosive
       increase in the marketing of the drug. So that neutral special
       interest group effectively became an advocate for the drug company
       on the basis of a relatively small investment that was very well
       targeted. All education and drug research in the field was
       dominated by the company selling the drug. I explained that much
       better results could be obtained from exercise and tobacco control
       but of course no interest was shown in that point of view. I was
       permitted to speak for only 15 minutes while the experts from
       America and those from New Zealand who had also conducted
       experiments funded by the drug company spoke for six hours.
	   
<p>       In a sense that analogy relates to the difficulty of maintaining
       independent research in an environment in which the public
       interest is being continually and increasingly subverted by
       corporate imperatives. The same thing occurs in the gambling
       industry, where gambling research is slowly being carried out and
       is battling for independence from the gambling companies. The
       gambling problem is huge, with $994 per head per year being spent
       on gambling in New South Wales. There is still no good
       sociological research into the effects and harm of gambling, but
       the industry, by exerting pressure, gets away with doing what it
       wants.
	   
<p>       A salient book on gene technology, How the other half dies by
       Susan George, examines world agribusiness and how it has stopped
       countries producing subsistence agriculture and forced them to use
       their land to produce market crops, often for export, which have
       been treated with pesticides. What is not mentioned in the
       equation is that displaced subsistence farmers and their families
       do not have anything to eat. The gross domestic product [GDP] of
       the country may go up but the welfare of its citizens may go
       hopelessly down. People are quick to point to the changes to the
       GDP, but if the extra GDP money is spent on seed and fertiliser it
       is of little practical use to its people. Governments forget that
       their key function is to govern and regulate companies in the
       interests of their people. The purpose of governments is to act
       for their people against other global and very powerful forces.
	   
<p>       There is a lack of government-funded research, and there are
       problems with the joint venture agriculture programs, which lead
       to regulatory capture by some groups. On 15 May on the SBS program
       Insight it was pointed out that many of the supposedly neutral
       players in debate on this matter are, in fact, being paid by
       Monsanto: it is indeed regulatory capture. What is actually needed
       is independent testing. If people are genuinely involved in the
       testing they must share in the intellectual capital. Groups are
       not clearly visible--they are not merely farmers and consumers.
       There needs to be segregation, and the cost of segregation and
       cleaning equipment must be met by the proponents. Other costs must
       be met by independent scientists. The increasing use of herbicides
       will affect the soil bacteria, and may affect the ecosystem.
	   
<p>       The Network of Concerned Farmers, which lobbied for this bill,
       talked about volunteers, which are the plantings that come after a
       harvest. They pointed out that in Canada if a crop of canola is
       planted and then harvested the field is not used during winter
       because nothing else will grow. However, in Australia after a
       canola field is harvested wheat is planted and the so-called
       volunteers spring up, and if certain herbicides are not able to be
       used then others may be used. That may negate any benefit. The
       idea that one can use less herbicide is a nonsense because the
       Roundup Ready seedlings may interfere.
	   
<p>       In How the other half dies it is stated that corporate interests
       have overcome countries and regulators by appearing to have
       superior technology but do not act in the interests of the people.
       It is not hard to see that if Australia became contaminated with
       GM food we would have to support the United States of America in
       its attack on Europe. I believe we are already joined in the legal
       action in the world trade court. Australia and the United States
       are rivals. If we had a lot of GM-free food and took the United
       States markets, Europe would not be forced to accept GM crops.
	   
<p>       How the other half dies also refers to the creation of dependence
       on companies for seeds and pesticides. It is interesting that
       insurance seems to have been pushed to one side: it would be
       impossibly expensive and, thus, there would be no requirement for
       it. It is said that the market demands these things, but the
       market--if one believes insurance companies have a reasonable
       market, which I think is a dubious proposition--has spoken and
       said that insurance is prohibitively expensive. That means people
       will take the risk of not having insurance. Effectively, the
       Government is the insurer with the risk on the downside. That
       issue has not been adequately addressed in this bill.
	   
<p>       In relation to the Gene Technology (New South Wales) Bill, much
       has been made of Dolly the cloned sheep. Some people have jumped
       to the conclusion that soon we will have platoons of cloned people
       marching down the street, like something out of Brave New World.
       What is not so well publicised is that it took several hundred
       attempts to produce one Dolly--which was a defective organism and
       caused its death. All other attempts to produce organisms like
       Dolly were deficient in one way or another. Similarly, early
       attempts by Unilever to clone oil palms for their plantations in
       Malaya worked beautifully in the laboratory but when the seedlings
       were planted out, they never set fruit. Both Dolly and the oil
       palms illustrate the difficulty of reproducing a complete living
       organism by cloning. To talk about being able to clone humans is
       either fantasy or fraudulent at this point in time.
	   
<p>       Examples of producing a living organism by cloning is the
       technique of inducing bacteria to produce human-compatible
       insulin, which makes the treatment of diabetes cheaper and more
       widely available. Other examples are a vaccine for hepatitis B, a
       human growth hormone and a blood-clotting agent. In these
       applications a substance is extracted from the genetically
       modified organism [GMO] and there is no possibility of its
       escaping into the environment as a viable organism. In these
       cases, both the risk and the benefit are to the user of the
       technology. The complexity of gene systems makes it unlikely that
       gene technology will be successful on its own to improve the yield
       of a crop plant. It has been found that the process of fixing
       nitrogen depends on 17 genes in bacteria and on 50 genes in
       plants. Many GM crops have indeed been found to give lower yields
       than varieties bred by classical methods, for example, Roundup
       Ready cotton and maize. That makes us very suspicious of the
       claims that yields will be higher, and one wonders if it is
       marketing nonsense in order to get the crops into the field.
	   
<p>       The benefit gene technology promises to producers comes from
       simplifying and lowering the cost of producing a crop. There are
       also benefits for the producer of the GM seed and the chemicals
       needed to grow the crop. The risks associated with the technology
       on the other hand are to the consumer and the environment. For
       this reason it is important that the use of GM crops be strictly
       and effectively regulated and that extensive tests of all aspects
       be carried out before general use. A small percentage of the
       population is highly sensitive and may have an allergic reaction
       to a particular genetically modified organism. This happened in
       the case of soybeans with a gene taken from brazil nuts to improve
       its nutritional value.
	   
<p>       The percentage of allergic people is small but it seems to be
       increasing. Nonetheless, the fear of gene technology induced
       damage to health is highly exaggerated. Many consumers have this
       fear and object to using GM products. They constitute an important
       and growing market for GM-free products. Moreover, they are
       prepared to pay a premium for such products. Producers who wish to
       supply that market are affected by the use of GM crops by others
       in various ways Contamination of GM-free crops can occur in
       various ways, such as by cross pollination from a GM crop grown
       somewhere in the district, and is very difficult to avoid.
	   
<p>       The Gene Technology Regulator requires a buffer zone to be
       determined for each licensed GM planting. This may be up to a few
       hundred metres, but in Canada a canola crop was claimed to be
       contaminated by cross-pollination carried by an insect from a GM
       crop four kilometres away. We were told by the Network of
       Concerned Farmers that even a Monsanto-sponsored trial found
       contamination of a crop from a GM canola crop that was three
       kilometres away. Contamination can occur through distribution of
       seed from a combine previously used during seeding or harvesting.
       Such machinery is often used by contractors on many farms, and it
       is difficult to clean those machines of residual grains or seeds
       between jobs. This applies also to post-harvest transport and
       storage.
	   
<p>       There is a worldwide growth in the demand for non-GM produce, and
       in some countries and to some multinational food companies only
       GM-free produce is acceptable. For example, Canada and Saudi
       Arabia will accept only livestock that has not been fed GM
       produce. However, GM cottonseed and cotton trash have already been
       used in cattle feed in Australia. Bonlac Food, Murray Goulburn and
       the National Food Company do not use produce from GM fed
       livestock, according to an article in the Herald and Weekly Times
       of 18 October 2000. Unilever, Kraft and Nestle exclude GM
       ingredients from some products, according to an article in the
       Sunday Tasmanian of 11 June 2000. The export of American corn and
       soya bean to Europe has dropped by more than half because of
       resistance to the use of GM produce.
	   
<p>       There are many ways in which the use of specific GM crops can harm
       the environment. Properties introduced into a cultivated species
       by gene technology can be transferred to a wild species, with
       disastrous results. This can occur by cross-pollination, if the
       species are related, or via pests, parasites or non-pollinating
       foraging insects to non-related species. I instance that the use
       of Roundup Ready crops, such as canola and maize, led to herbicide
       resistance being transferred to the wild radish, which is related
       to canola, making it a super weed which requires a much more toxic
       herbicide for its control.
	   
<p>       Although the use of Roundup-ready crops has the benefit of
       requiring less conservation of the soil, it leads in practice to
       greater use of Roundup because of greater resistance of weeds.
       This benefits the manufacturer, but it also interferes with soil
       bacteria that are essential to keep the soil healthy. It
       interferes with the fungal mycorrhysomes which are essential for
       mobilising nutriments for plant growth. It increases the amount of
       residual glyphosate in the crop, leading to pressure to increase
       the maximum residue limit in food products. An equivalent
       situation has arisen from the widespread use of BT cotton. This
       includes a gene from the bacillus thuringiensis and leads to the
       emergence of insects that are resistant to the toxin produced by
       the bacillus. This diminishes the effectiveness of one of the few
       environmentally acceptable insecticides available to organic
       growers.
	   
<p>       There are also more general ways in which the use of genetically
       modified organisms causes damage to the environment. The transfer
       of genes through gene technology from one species to another
       involves the use of viruses that can overcome the defensive
       systems of many different organisms. These viral vectors are used
       to carry the desired gene from one species to the other. They
       become incorporated in the gene system, the genome, of the
       genetically modified organisms and retain their ability to
       transfer genes and invade other species. This leads to an increase
       in spontaneous mutations and thus to the destabilisation of
       species. An example of this is the rapid emergence of the
       BT-resistant insects that I have mentioned previously.
	   
<p>       Another tool used in gene technology is the marker gene. These
       genes make genetically modified organisms resistant to
       antibiotics. This enables genetically modified organisms to be
       selected from among the unaltered organisms, which are killed by
       the antibiotic. Some of these antibiotics are used in treating
       human diseases, and if resistance to them spreads throughout the
       environment they lose their effectiveness. This was the reason
       that the use of a particular genetically modified maize was
       rejected in the United Kingdom. It contained a marker gene that
       conferred resistance to ampicillin. This antibiotic is widely used
       in medicine, and it would be a great loss if it became
       ineffective. Naturally, of course, the cost of this would not be
       borne by the agricultural company. Alternative marker genes can be
       used and, according to a recent United Kingdom Government report,
       there are methods of eliminating the marker genes from the final
       genetically modified organism.
	   
<p>       When a farmer decides to use genetically modified seeds, he has to
       enter a contract not to collect some of the crop for future seed.
       The genetically modified organism is patented, and in buying the
       seed he is given a licence by the owner of the patent for only a
       single use. The farmer also has to have a licence under the Gene
       Technology Act that regulates such things as: the size of the
       buffer zone to be kept fallow, or to be planted with the non-GM
       crop; the removal of "volunteer plants" growing after the removal
       of the crop; and the amount of liability insurance to be taken
       out, et cetera. On top of that, he has to buy the pesticide and
       fertiliser needed to grow the crop. All this diminishes the power
       of the farmer to use his own discretion in running the farm
       according to his experience and local conditions.
	   
<p>       Each licence for genetically modified organisms dealings raises
       its own problems and own risks. It is good to have a central,
       competent authority to deal with these. Many involve specifically
       local factors, so it is important to have local input into the
       decisions. The factors may be geographic, economic or social.
       Although it is very good that there is, more or less, uniform
       legislation and regulation of gene technology matters in all the
       States and Territories, the ultimate responsibility for such
       matters still lies with individual governments. It is therefore
       important that the State Government have some source of
       independent--that is, independent from the Federal Government and
       from industry--knowledge and advice in these matters. There
       should, therefore, be a New South Wales advisory committee on gene
       technology, which could be called upon when questions arise that
       are specific to New South Wales. Such questions can be scientific,
       economic, social, legal or operational. The committee should thus
       represent a wide range of knowledge and expertise. The committee
       should have about 10 members and be administered by a neutral
       authority, such as the Chief Secretary. It should meet as required
       when problems arise, but at least twice a year. The sorts of
       problems that the committee might be expected to deal with are
       enumerated in the summary sheet.
	   
<p>       Under the Gene Technology Act the Ministerial Council can set
       policy guidelines, but it cannot interfere with any particular
       applications before the Gene Technology Regulator. There should be
       some mechanism by which the State can express its concern about a
       particular case. Although the State Department of Agriculture can
       advise the Gene Technology Regulator, the Gene Technology
       Regulator need not accept or follow such advice. Obviously, in the
       case of the cognate bill, nor does the Minister. The Gene
       Technology Regulator is not obliged to follow the advice of the
       organisations that he consults. This includes State agriculture
       departments, the SGTAC and local government. The Gene Technology
       Regulator is empowered to initiate his own investigations and,
       presumably, will have funds for this. The SGTAC will have no funds
       to carry out its own investigations. There should be some
       mechanism by which the Gene Technology Regulator is made to take
       up important problems raised by the SGTAC.
	   
<p>       Under the Gene Technology Act only two avenues are open for
       appeals against decisions of the Grain Technology Regulator. An
       applicant for a licence can appeal for review by the Gene
       Technology Regulator or directly to Parliament, or to the
       Administrative Decisions Appeals Tribunal for a legal, which
       hopefully would mean a substantive, review. The last-mentioned
       avenue is also open to an aggrieved party who is directly affected
       by a decision. The only other avenue is a common law claim for
       damages due to a decision by the Grain Technology Regulator or to
       an infringement of a licence. This avenue is also open to an
       aggrieved party only and does not offer the possibility of a third
       party being involved in the common interest, or otherwise.
	   
<p>       The Gene Technology Act does not define any liability that the
       user of gene technology or the Gene Technology Regulator may have
       for environmental damage or for damage caused to a third party.
       Such damage is envisaged in section 62 (3), in dealing with
       licence conditions which may "require a license holder to be
       adequately insured against any loss, damage or injury that may be
       caused to human health, property or the environment by the
       licensed dealing". However, companies that go belly up may not
       necessarily pay those sorts of damages.
	   
<p>       If that were not enough, I should now talk directly about the Gene
       Technology (GM Crop Moratorium) Bill. This bill, in its draft
       form, gives absolute power to "the Minister", without even stating
       which Minister. This absolute power is entrenched in the
       legislation and cannot be challenged in many of its aspects.
       Clause 12 prevents the challenge, review or questioning of any
       order made by the Minister. This is an impossible situation for
       the Minister and the growers affected by the bill. The Minister
       may not have been in his portfolio for many months and could not
       possibly know all the answers to all the aspects of a complex
       field, such as genetically modified organisms--even if those
       answers were known with some certainty by an independent
       committee. Of course, in science the definition of "certainty"
       tends to be a statistical definition. The problems that arise in
       the field differ from region to region and change in time, and the
       Minister cannot rely on the decisions made by the Federal Gene
       Technology Regulator for the whole of Australia. It is therefore
       essential that there be an ongoing, statutory advisory committee
       charged with evaluating and planning the use of genetically
       modified organisms in New South Wales. It is proposed to establish
       such a committee under an amendment of the cognate Gene Technology
       (New South Wales) Bill.
	   
<p>       Clause 14 prevents the Minister from making any directions unless
       he can give positive proof that a GMO is involved in that
       activity. This would prevent him from acting on a suspicion or a
       report given under clause 21. Clauses 17 and 18 provide that
       directions under the bill can be appealed only by an aggrieved
       party to the Supreme Court. Such an appeal does not inhibit the
       execution of a direction until the court hears the appeal.
       Challenges under the Administrative Appeals Tribunal also appear
       to be excluded. Once again, we will be caught up in court waiting
       times. Clause 38 gives very wide powers of delegation to the
       Minister and the Director-General of Agriculture. In the last
       section authorised persons include "any person of a class
       prescribed by the regulations". This seems to open the way for
       self-regulation by the industry, or the situation created in the
       case of building inspectors when the whole regulatory function was
       abandoned to the private sector.
	   
<p>       The committee must be independent, have an adequate budget for
       experiments and be totally separate from control by companies. The
       omens are not propitious. The cost benefits must be analysed and
       the ecological effects on soil bacteria, pestilence and other
       organisms, et cetera must be examined extremely carefully. The
       gung-ho approach to the writing and introduction of the bill does
       not in any way suggest that the Government is assessing the
       situation seriously. I thank John Hepworth from Greenpeace, who
       said that there is no real evidence of benefit in yields. He is
       concerned about the total ministerial power and NSWAgriculture
       being part of the joint venture, as is the Victorian Department of
       Agriculture. Consequently, funding pressure will come from the
       corporate sector and the department will pressure the Minister to
       go ahead.
	   
<p>       I wonder how the Minister can resist this, with the expertise in
       his department, but obviously his office does not have this same
       degree of expertise. Greenpeace pointed out that in the United
       States, Monsanto has sued farmers who have used seed from the year
       before and farmers whose land or products are contaminated as if
       it is their fault. Clause 16 should work the other way around. The
       bill will be repealed in 2006, but surely it should continue until
       it is clear that GM crops are safe, and in what form they are
       safe. Greenpeace pointed out that the legislation does not clearly
       outline the conditions attached to the three-year moratorium on GE
       canola crops in New South Wales and, thus, does not clearly fulfil
       the Government's pre-election commitment.
	   
<p>       Clause 6 states that the legislation will expire on 3 March 2006,
       which makes little sense if the legislation establishes a
       framework to put in place a moratoria on different food crops.
       Clause 7 will allow the Minister to establish a moratorium order.
       The details of the specific moratorium order are not contained
       within the legislation and would need to be added. It would be
       more sensible for the moratorium order to contain the end date
       rather than the legislative framework. The repeal date makes sense
       only if the legislation is structured such that the terms of the
       moratorium are included in the legislation. If the legislation
       remains open-ended as a framework to establish a moratorium, then
       the moratorium order for GM canola should be tabled with the
       legislation. If the repeal date remains in place then details of
       the moratorium for GM canola should be part of the legislation.
	   
<p>       The discretionary capacity of the Minister to prohibit cultivation
       in New South Wales is not adequate. The mechanism to advocate a GM
       moratorium should require parliamentary approval. Clause 16 leaves
       it open for non-GM farmers who have been subject to contamination
       to be liable for clean-up costs. Liability for contamination
       should rest with the responsible party, including the technology
       provider and the proponent. The advisory committee is not referred
       to in the legislation, but its role should be outlined. Greenpeace
       would like the legislation to achieve, either in the moratorium
       order or the legislation itself, a moratorium on the commercial
       release, which includes prohibition on the cultivation and/or
       growing of genetically engineered canola in New South Wales and
       prohibition on the introduction of GE canola into agricultural
       supply chains in New South Wales.
	   
<p>       Exemptions must be subject to approval in the first instance by
       the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator [OGTR] as an
       experimental dealing; technology providers, proponents and growers
       are able to guarantee no contamination and are fully liable for
       any contamination that occurs, including all clean-up costs; there
       are no prudent and feasible alternatives to the use of GE in the
       proponent's trial; and proponents must demonstrate the purpose of
       experimental dealing and the need for the experiment. Greenpeace
       states that the advisory committee is similar in composition to
       the Gene Technology Grains Committee, which has failed to
       adequately represent farmers and the wider grain industry. It
       suggests there is no point in creating a new committee that
       embodies the failures of the existing committee and recommends
       that representatives of the Australian Consumers Association, the
       Grain Harvesters Association, non-GM farmers, the Organic Farmers
       of Australia, the Local Government Association, the Twynam
       Agriculture Group, the Stock Feed Manufacturers Association of
       Australia, the food industry, dairy companies, the honeybee
       industry, grain exporters, grain marketers, grain handlers, the
       New South Wales Farmers Association and an environmental
       representative be appointed to the committee.
	   
<p>       The Food Policy Officer of the Australian Consumers Association
       states that every consumer has the right to make an informed
       choice and to expect that governments will make decisions to
       protect them and their interests. The concern of the association
       is that the approach taken by some governments and bureaucracies
       is to convince consumers that GM is necessary and inevitable.
       There is no consumer demand for GM because consumers are concerned
       about its impact on public health and the environment. Some
       consumers are opposed to GM on the basis of ethical or religious
       beliefs. Biotechnology companies will benefit by increasing
       control over food production and consumption. The more information
       consumers have about genetically modified food the more cautious
       they become. Currently, available research has been carried out by
       or on behalf of biotechnology companies with an interest in
       showing that GM is not harmful. There is a severe lack of truly
       independent research.
	   
<p>       Most studies are carried out on animals such as rats and chickens
       over a short time frame of four days to four weeks. Much of the
       research is incapable of reaching conclusions about the long-term
       implications of genetic modification on health. The Australian
       Consumers Association points out the precautionary principle
       which, in medical parlance, is: above all do no harm. The
       possibility of serious harm or lack of scientific certainty should
       not be used as a reason to postpone measures to prevent harm. The
       Gene Technology Regulator is concluding that GM crops are safe but
       currently available evidence proves otherwise, which is
       effectively a reversal of proof. Lack of evidence of harm does not
       indicate safety; rather, it indicates that more research is
       required before a concrete conclusion can be drawn about the
       safety of GM crops on health and the environment.
	   
<p>       State and Territory governments attempted to address consumer
       concerns in GM labelling legislation, but the Federal Government
       preferred to ignore these concerns. The Federal Government is
       supporting United States action over the European Union GM
       moratorium, and the States and Territories are taking a similar
       precautionary approach. The Australian Consumers Association
       supports the State and Territory moratorium, as they will allow an
       opportunity to further investigate the implication of GM on
       health, the environment, international markets and trade. The
       Australian Consumers Association believes that the Gene Technology
       (GM Crop Moratorium) Bill will not deliver on Premier Carr's
       pre-election promise of a three-year moratorium on the commercial
       release of GM crops. Under the legislation the Minister will take
       on a similar role to the Gene Technology Regulator, approving or
       denying individual GM applications. This does not constitute a
       moratorium.
	   
<p>       The bill must encompass GM trials rather than leaving a loophole
       for quasi-commercial large-scale GM field trials, and it must be
       consistent with the Gene Technology Act acknowledging the role of
       the Gene Technology Regulator while giving the New South Wales
       Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries the ability to intervene
       should the regulator's decision pose significant risks. The
       Minister's advisory panel fails to include adequate consumer
       representation and, therefore, must be amended. The New South
       Wales Farmers Association is seeking provision in the legislation
       for a three-year trial of GM canola of a size that reflects real
       production conditions, no more than 5,000 hectares but likely to
       be much smaller. They want the trial to include the sale of GM
       crops to overseas markets to ensure that export is possible.
	   
<p>       New South Wales Farmers also want an independent committee to
       report to the Minister on the supply chain and market access
       issues. They recommended that the committee be comprised of an
       independent chairperson, canola growers, a scientist, an
       agronomist, and representatives from the Grain Harvesters
       Association, bulk handlers, marketers, and NSW Agriculture. We are
       concerned that on balance the bill has been introduced hastily. It
       gives far too much power to the Minister and there is insufficient
       budget and time for an independent assessment. The composition of
       the committees creating the assessment must be changed. We will
       certainly move amendments and support other amendments in the hope
       that it will be regulated. We do not oppose the concept of the
       bill, but its nature and the haste with which it was put together
       needs a great deal of further attention.
	   
<p>       Reverend the Hon. FRED NILE [4.29 p.m.]: The Christian Democratic
       Party supports in principle the Gene Technology (New South Wales)
       Bill and its cognate bill, the Gene Technology (GM Crop
       Moratorium) Bill. The Christian Democratic Party shares the
       concerns that have already been expressed by other honourable
       members during this debate. We are moving into unknown territory
       when we treat food with gene technology. As other honourable
       members have observed, the debate is similar to debate on changes
       to human beings through cloning. Many people feel that science is
       rushing ahead too quickly for our society. Questions have been
       asked about tests that show no harmful results of gene technology.
       In many areas of scientific endeavour, it is not a matter of what
       happens in one, two or even three years: the effects may not be
       evident for generations. Although innovation may be undertaken
       with good intentions, sometimes there is a cumulative effect of
       technology which may not show up for a long period. I hope and
       pray that that is not the case, but that is one of the concerns of
       the Christian Democratic Party.
	   
<p>       I remember seeing a recent television program on a very healthy
       young mother who followed every rule and regulation about food she
       should eat while pregnant. Because she had been told that fish is
       very good for pregnant women, she ate a great deal of deep-sea
       fish. She suffered many miscarriages and did not realise until she
       obtained the results of scientific tests that she had accumulated
       an almost fatal dose of mercury. Even after she stopped eating a
       particular species of fish, her mercury levels dropped very
       slowly. Such contamination occurs only because the larger fish eat
       smaller fish and consequently deep-sea fish had accumulated
       mercury. Unexpected side-effects can occur from changes to the
       food chain, and in the case of the technology the effects may only
       be evident in the long term. For that reason, gene technology must
       be monitored carefully by scientists and responsible authorities.
	   
<p>       As honourable members know, the Gene Technology (New South Wales)
       Bill gives effect to a nationally consistent statute-based
       regulatory scheme to protect public health and safety and the
       environment from risks associated with gene technology. It is
       worthwhile remembering that powers for the protection of public
       health and safety and protection of the environment are vested in
       the Commonwealth. I was pleased to note that this legislation is
       designed to be part of a national approach and to complement
       Commonwealth legislation that was passed in 2000. The Commonwealth
       Gene Technology Act 2000 clearly states:
	   
<p>       The object ... is to protect the health and safety of people, and
       to protect the environment, by identifying risks posed by or as a
       result of gene technology, and by managing those risks through
       regulating certain dealings with GMOs.
	   
<p>       The Commonwealth legislation spells out that there will be a
       regulatory framework to provide that where there are threats of
       serious or irreversible environmental damage, a lack of full
       scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing
       cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation, and
       to provide an efficient and effective system to the application of
       gene technologies. The powers to legislate to protect health and
       safety and the environment are vested in the Commonwealth,
       although I am not suggesting that this Parliament should be
       uninterested in such matters. The point I make is that it is a
       matter of establishing a proper order of authority and sequence in
       dealing with these matters so that honourable members do not
       approach the legislation before this House as though this State is
       operating in a vacuum.
	   
<p>       In my view some honourable members who participated in this debate
       are really debating the Commonwealth's legislation which covers
       the protection of public health and safety and the protection of
       the environment. My reading of the Commonwealth legislation
       suggests that the Commonwealth Parliament deliberately intended to
       cover the field. Because that legislation originated at the
       Federal level, it provides all the definitions of terms which will
       be adopted by all State Legislatures in complementing the
       Commonwealth Act. The definitions include:
	   
<l>       gene technology means any technique, modification of genes or
       other genetic material, but does not include:
	   
<l>       (a) sexual reproduction.
	   
<p>       The Commonwealth legislation does not apply to any technology that
       relates to human beings. The Commonwealth Act also states:
	   
<l>       genetically modified organism means:
	   
<l>       (a) an organism that has been modified by gene technology.
	   
<p>       That definition provides further detail that I will not go into.
       Because protections are provided in the Commonwealth legislation,
       that relieves this State of the responsibility of formulating
       provisions under State jurisdictions. Severe penalties are
       provided in the Commonwealth Act against persons who do not
       conform to regulations relating to gene technology. The
       Commonwealth Act provides for a number of offences, including
       aggravated offences which cause significant damage to health or
       safety of people or to the environment. Section 38 states:
	   
<p>       An offensive is an aggravated offence if the commission of the
       offence causes significant damage, or is likely to cause
       significant damage, to the health and safety of people or to the
       environment.
	   
<p>       I will not go into detail, but that provision shows that a great
       deal of care has been taken in moving into gene technology
       innovation. I note also that the regulator will be a Federal
       entity. My attempts to establish whether the regulator will be a
       board or a commission have led me to the belief that the regulator
       will be one person who acts on the advice of a technical advisory
       committee and a gene technology community consultative committee.
       At the Federal level there is also an ethics committee. Because
       those controls have been established at the Federal level, there
       is no need to have State counterpart ethics committees. The
       Federal Gene Technology Ethics Committee is comprised of people
       with expertise and ethical experience in matters concerning the
       environment, health, applied ethics, law, religious practices,
       population health and agricultural practices, among others.
	   
<p>       The Hon. Ian Macdonald: They are working currently. The members
       have been appointed.
	   
<p>       Reverend the Hon. FRED NILE: Yes. The Commonwealth Act covers the
       fields of protection and safety in the application of gene
       technology, although some honourable members who have participated
       in this debate have been speaking as though the State Parliament
       is operating in a vacuum which justifies the State Minister
       setting up similar bodies--as if New South Wales has independent
       responsibilities for gene technology innovation. We are part of a
       national network. The Minister has the power to provide
       exemptions, but does he do that in consultation with the regulator
       so that the exemptions would be approved by the Minister and/or
       the regulator?
	   
<p>       The Hon. Ian Macdonald: No. The trials employ the regulator's
       protocol, on the advice of the advisory committee.
	   
<p>       Reverend the Hon. FRED NILE: But the regulator does not have to
       confirm the Government's decision?
	   
<p>       The Hon. Ian Macdonald: No. They have a structure which would be
       applied.
	   
<p>       Reverend the Hon. FRED NILE: The Minister explained at the
       crossbench briefing that the Gene Technology (GM Moratorium) Bill
       basically deals with marketing, and that is why it contains
       nothing about safety, health, environment--those matters are
       covered in the Federal legislation, which applies to New South
       Wales. Obviously there is tension over the use of GM products. The
       European Union has been strongly opposed to GM products, but
       apparently it has now lifted that ban. GM products have been
       widely used in the United States of America, Canada, the
       Argentine, China, India, and other countries. If Australia moves
       more strongly into this area, its future markets may be affected
       and countries may not purchase our GM products. Apparently the
       countries to which we currently sell our products will not be
       affected. Obviously, those involved in marketing would ensure that
       if GM crops are produced there would still be a market for all our
       products.
	   
<p>       There would be no point in having advanced technology that would
       prevent us from selling our products. However, there are other
       practical problems with trials, including their size. At briefings
       crossbenchers heard that the plots would be 1,000 hectares or
       more, because to be beneficial they need to be fairly large.
       Small-plot trials did not deliver conclusive results. The Minister
       will need to resolve the size of the buffer between GM and non-GM
       areas when he considers any exemptions. The Gene Technology (GM
       Crop Moratorium) Bill fulfils the commitment by the Premier given
       prior to the March State election to place a three-year ban on the
       commercial release of GM food products in New South Wales, such as
       canola, mustard and field peas. The moratorium applies from 3
       March 2003.
	   
<p>       Pest-resistant cotton products, which have been grown in New South
       Wales for several years, will be exempt from that moratorium.
       About one-third of the New South Wales cotton crop is GM cotton.
       Of course, as other honourable members have said, we do not eat
       cotton. Therefore GM cotton production is not as controversial as
       is the production of GM foods. I have a recollection, however,
       that product from cotton farmers was being treated and sold to
       animals for stock feed. Does that mean that GM products were
       consumed by animals in stock feed and then by humans via the food
       chain? Perhaps I should not have said that: the Greens may not
       have been aware of that fact. The crossbenchers have received
       briefings from a number of organisations concerned about gene
       technology. Greenpeace was concerned about the discretionary
       capacity of the Minister to prohibit cultivation. The briefing
       paper from Greenpeace stated:
	   
<p>       Clause 16 leaves it open for Non-GM farmers who have been subject
       to contamination to be liable for clean up costs. Liability to
       contamination should rest with the responsible parties including
       the technology provider and the proponent.
	   
<p>       The non-GM farmer should not be penalised for the practices of GM
       farmers. I ask the Minister to explain whether that interpretation
       is correct. The New South Wales Farmers Association appears to be
       sitting on the fence. In a document entitled "GM moratorium allows
       more time for research" the association stated:
	   
<p>       The State Government's moratorium on GM crops has been welcomed by
       the NSW Farmers' Association, which says more research needs to be
       done before there's a general release of the technology.
	   
<p>       Association President, Mal Peters, says a lot of questions still
       need to be answered from a farming perspective, such as the
       performance of GM crops, whether they can be kept apart from
       non-GM crops and their ability to be sold.
	   
<p>       The association wants more trials held so that final decisions can
       be made. Its statement continued:
       These trials must be tightly controlled, but big enough to test
       the claims of the biotech companies about how the crops perform in
       the field, along with the capabilities of the supply chain and
       both domestic and international markets.
	   
<p>       In some respects the New South Wales Farmers Association is
       hedging its bets, but obviously it supports both bills. A
       deputation from the Network of Concerned Farmers, which is
       concerned about some aspects of the moratorium bill, addressed the
       crossbenchers. It submitted:
	   
<p>       Any new trials must be decided by the [advisory] committee and
       must comply with the following criteria:
	   
<l>       A 10 km notification zone.
	   
<l>       Zero contamination within the notification zone.
	   
<l>       The Minister, in his wisdom, will have to weigh up those matters,
       as well as determine the size of the trials.
	   
<p>       The Hon. Ian Macdonald: The advisory committee will address that,
       taking into account the national protocol.
	   
<p>       Reverend the Hon. FRED NILE: And the committee will advise the
       Minister of its resolution. The Australian Consumers Association
       was fairly negative about the use of gene technology. The
       association is unhappy about some of the conditions of the
       moratorium. It stated:
	   
<p>       This legislation will not deliver on Premier Carr's pre-election
       promise of a three-year moratorium on the commercial release of GM
       crops.
	   
<p>       That is because the Minister can grant exemptions. But the
       association wants a total moratorium.
	   
<p>       The Hon. Ian Macdonald: We never said we would ban research.
	   
<p>       Reverend the Hon. FRED NILE: The Christian Democratic Party
       supports the bills. There is no point moving amendments that would
       reverse some of the objectives of the bills. Maybe in Committee
       members will debate whether the amendments are in line with the
       objects of the bills. We will vote on the amendments on the basis
       of trying to maintain the objects of the two bills.
	   
<p>       The Hon. RICK COLLESS [4.48 p.m.]: The Gene Technology (GM Crop
       Moratorium) Bill relates to the Government's pre-election
       commitment to enact a three-year moratorium on the commercial
       release of genetically modified [GM] plants. The bill enables the
       Minister to make an order prohibiting the cultivation in New South
       Wales of a GM food plant and to make an exemption order under the
       moratorium to allow the cultivation of GM food plants. It enables
       the Minister to elect a person or persons to destroy or dispose of
       any GM food plant found to be grown in contravention of the
       moratorium. The bill makes it an offence to fail to comply with
       the direction of the Minister and allows the Director-General of
       NSW Agriculture to appoint inspectors with wide-ranging powers to
       examine sites and crops to determine whether the moratorium under
       the bill has been complied with. Finally, the bill enables the
       Supreme Court to grant an injunction restraining a person from
       contravening the proposed Act.
	   
<p>       The Minister has also indicated that a GM advisory council will be
       established to monitor field trials under a moratorium. The bill
       enacts a moratorium on the release of GM food crops consistent
       with the New South Wales Coalition's policy, although the
       Government's moratorium is shorter than the five-year moratorium
       proposed by the Coalition. As the shadow agriculture Minister, the
       Deputy Leader of the Opposition, has indicated, the Coalition has
       some serious concerns about this bill. Let me reiterate those
       concerns. First, the Minister becomes the sole arbiter of whether
       an exemption can be granted under the moratorium. Second, the bill
       does not give any details on how the trials may be conducted under
       the moratorium, including what contamination issues might be
       addressed and what guidelines will be enacted to protect
       conventional crops from potential GM contamination. Third, the
       bill does not specify how genetic plant material that is seized in
       contravention of the moratorium will be disposed of, and it makes
       no reference to what measures will be put in place to ensure that
       GM contamination does not occur during the disposal process.
	   
<p>       The bill contains no reference to the advisory council referred to
       in the Minister's press release of 15 May and it does not allow
       any appeal process against the Minister granting an exemption to
       the moratorium. As has already been said in this House on a number
       of occasions, the bill also enacts the repeal of the Act on 3
       March 2006. I believe that is inappropriate as it automatically
       repeals the Act even if the forthcoming research trials ultimately
       preclude the widespread release of GM crops. The Opposition does
       not oppose this bill but it proposes to move amendments in
       Committee along the following lines: to replace the advisory
       council structure and functions in the bill based on the structure
       used to enact the New South Wales Game Council under the Game and
       Feral Animal Control Bill 2002; to include strict definitions on
       how trials may be conducted under a moratorium, including
       guidelines and requirements relating to contamination issues; to
       allow a defined appeal process against the granting of a
       ministerial exemption order; and to specify methods of disposal of
       seized GM material and specified guidelines for the transport of
       GM-contaminated material.
	   
<p>       The Coalition has openly consulted with the New South Wales
       Farmers Association, the Australian Wheat Board, the Network of
       Concerned Farmers, the Natural Produce Network and Greenpeace
       Australia. The Federal Gene Technology Act 2000, which underpins
       the new regulatory system, took effect on 21 June 2001. The new
       system, which is Australia's first national regulatory system for
       gene technology, is designed to protect the health and safety of
       people and the environment by identifying risks posed by or as a
       result of gene technology, and to manage those risks by regulating
       certain dealings with genetically modified organisms. The new
       regulatory system replaces the former voluntary system overseen by
       the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee. The legislation also
       establishes a statutory officer, the Gene Technology Regulator, to
       administer the legislation and make decisions under that
       legislation. The regulator is supported by the Office of Gene
       Technology Regulator [OGTR]--a Commonwealth regulatory body
       located within the health and ageing portfolio.
	   
<p>       The Act prohibits persons from dealing with genetically modified
       organism GMOs unless the dealing is exempt, is a notifiable
       low-risk dealing on the register of GMOs, or is licensed by the
       regulator. The OGTR has received an application from Aventis
       CropScience Pty Ltd for a licence for the limited and controlled
       release of genetically modified, herbicide-tolerant canola
       registered under the trade name InVigor. InVigor canola plants
       have been genetically modified to introduce a hybrid breeding
       system based on male sterile and fertility restorer lines, and to
       be tolerant to the herbicide glufosinate ammonium. Lines T45 and
       Topas 19/2 have been genetically modified to introduce glufosinate
       ammonium tolerance but do not contain the hybrid breeding system.
       Glufosinate ammonium, a herbicidal chemical marketed as Liberty
       Herbicide and Basta, is used to control a range of weeds as a
       post-emergent herbicide over the top of the genetically modified
       canola crop. Commercially grown canola yields from 1 to 2.5 tonnes
       of seed per hectare, with an oil content of between 40 and 50 per
       cent. The post-crushing meal is also used as a high-protein animal
       feed.
	   
<p>       Before I became a member of Parliament I was an agricultural
       consultant. I did a lot of work with canola, soybean and maize
       growers, and growers of many other crops. We obtained some
       interesting results for those three crops. I refer, in particular,
       to yield increases of 20 per cent in canola with an increased oil
       content of 6 per cent--rising from 43 per cent to 49 per cent.
       This was achieved by better crop management, more appropriate
       fertiliser use, and developing with the farmer an understanding of
       biological fertiliser management. Weed control was also improved.
       I will refer to a couple of different types of plants to reveal
       how this improved weed control can occur. The plants that are
       generally used as crop plants and which are high in protein can be
       referred to as proteinaceous plants. They are encouraged by high
       and better crop nutrition.
	   
<p>       The other sorts of plants--weed-type plants that can be referred
       to as carbonaceous plants--can survive under conditions of lower
       calcium, lower phosphorous and lower sulfur in the soil. The
       plants are called carbonaceous plants because they only have
       access to the nutrients of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. They are
       the weed species. When we manage the soil correctly, the
       proteinaceous plants, or the high-value crop plants--wheat,
       canola, barley, corn, soybeans and those sorts of plants--are
       favoured by better nutrition conditions in the soil and will
       compete much more effectively with the carbonaceous plants or the
       weed species. I also had similar results with soybeans and corn,
       with a 20 per cent increase in yield and higher oil content in
       soybeans and a 20 per cent increase in maize crops just by better
       understanding the crop nutrition requirements and the biological
       activity of the soils.
	   
<p>       The literature for InVigor canola states that yield increases of
       up to 15 per cent can be achieved when compared with yields for
       conventional open-pollinated canola species. One must ask: Why
       were the yield increases not compared to currently available
       non-GM hybrid varieties such as the Hyola lines, which also have a
       considerable yield advantage over the open-pollinated varieties?
       Apples are not being compared with apples; they are being compared
       with onions. The yield increases that my client farmers achieved
       were with the Hyola hybrids. They were compared to the same
       variety in the same year but with conventional fertiliser
       management as recommended by the mainstream agencies.
	   
<p>       Canola oil is used in the manufacture of a variety of products.
       Canola meal is primarily used as a feed for livestock, but it is
       also used in poultry and fish feed, pet foods and fertilisers. The
       OGTR's risk assessment and risk management plan states that none
       of the canola plants from the release, or their by-products, will
       be used in human food or animal food. I wonder what will happen to
       the meal that is obtained from the crushing of this genetically
       modified canola seed? Oil derived from InVigor canola has been
       approved for human consumption by Food Standards Australia New
       Zealand--formerly the Australian New Zealand Food Authority. In
       the research that I have done on this topic I have not been able
       to locate the research papers that confirm its suitability for
       human consumption that must have been reviewed by Food Standards
       Australia New Zealand. I am sure that they exist, but I have not
       been able to find them.
	   
<p>       The Hon. Duncan Gay: That is not uncommon when one is trying to
       research a subject.
	   
<p>       The Hon. RICK COLLESS: It is difficult to find the opposing view
       promoted by the proponents of the GM technology.
	   
<p>       The Hon. Duncan Gay: I have found that when statements are made
       and it is hard to find supporting evidence for them.
	   
<p>       The Hon. RICK COLLESS: Absolutely. I have also found it difficult
       to find such supporting evidence. Given that deoxyribonucleic acid
       [DNA] is an amino acid--all amino acids are the building blocks of
       proteins--and it has been modified in genetically modified crops,
       the question that remains relates to the amino acid molecular
       structure of GMO crops. Has the structure of the resultant
       proteins been changed and by how much? That is the question to
       which I have not been able to find an answer. What effect will
       these changed proteins have on the health and wellbeing of
       animals, including humans, who ultimately consume these proteins?
	   
<p>       InVigor Canola has been grown in various locations and conditions
       in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia,
       Queensland and Tasmania. The largest approved trial site was 712
       hectares. The regulator has made an initial assessment that the
       potential release does not pose a significant risk to human health
       or the environment. However, I am concerned that some of this
       genetic material may have already escaped into the environment. Is
       it already too late to prevent the contamination of wild
       populations of Brassica species? With so many unanswered questions
       regarding vested interests and complex health, environmental and
       economic issues involved in this debate, the Coalition welcomes
       the moratorium.
	   
<p>       At present three genetically modified agricultural crops are
       commercially available in Australia: Ingard BT Cotton, Roundup
       Ready Cotton, and Ingard/Roundup Ready Cotton. Canola may well be
       the next GM crop commercially available in Australia, irrespective
       of whether the majority of farmers and the wider community want
       it. Agrifood Awareness Australia promotes itself as an industry
       initiative established in May 1999 to increase public awareness
       of, and encourage informed debate about, gene technology. The
       organisation was founded by six peak bodies, including the Grains
       Research and Development Corporation, Avcare, the National Farmers
       Federation, the Seed Industry Association of Australia, the
       Australian Biotechnology Association and the National Agricultural
       Commodities Marketing Association.
	   
<p>       Agrifood Awareness Australia has released the results of a survey
       involving 1,000 participants that was conducted in June 2002 by
       Market Attitude Research Services on behalf of the Commonwealth
       Government agency Biotechnology Australia. As to the perceived
       benefits of GM foods, 75 per cent of survey respondents reported
       decreased use of pesticides and chemicals on crops, 69 per cent
       believed agricultural land would be used more efficiently and that
       higher yielding crops would lead to less expensive food, 53 per
       cent of respondents believed the risks of GM food currently
       outweigh the benefits, and 43 per cent of respondents felt that
       the risks will decrease with time. Some 73 per cent of respondents
       believed that they required more information about the technology.
	   
<p>       It is worth noting that the perceived benefits of decreased use of
       pesticides and higher-yielding crops can be achieved by more
       appropriate agronomic practices and by growing healthier crops.
       Healthy crops are more resistant to insect attack and weed
       invasion, as I explained earlier. The Network of Concerned Farmers
       [NCF] is a loose network of farmers who are concerned about the
       economic, environmental and social impacts of genetic engineering.
       The network aims to protect the rights of farmers to grow non-GE
       crops. Due to what they consider to be the impossibility of
       co-existence and segregation, they are working to stop the release
       of GE crops in Australia. Their concerns about GE canola relate to
       marketability, herbicide resistance, environmental impacts,
       patents and the corporate control of farming.
	   
<p>       The NCF is supported in its concerns by the Australian Wheat Board
       [AWB], which recently announced its opposition to the commercial
       release of genetically modified canola. In a submission to the
       Office of the Gene Technology Regulator [OGTR], the AWB said that
       there are not enough adequate safeguards to protect the integrity
       of the wheat crop. Andrew Lindberg, AWB managing director, said
       that the introduction of genetically modified canola might place
       at risk export markets in the Middle East and Asia. The AWB is one
       of the world's largest wheat management and marketing companies.
       It is responsible for the management and marketing of all
       Australian export bulk wheat and accounts for about 3 per cent of
       the total value of Australia's exports and about 12 per cent of
       Australia's total farm exports. The AWB joins a long list of
       grains industry organisations that oppose the release of
       genetically modified canola, including the Australian Barley
       Board, Pulse Australia, Twynams Agriculture Group, ICM
       Agribusiness and others. Farmers are concerned that State
       governments have not prepared appropriate legislation. Issues such
       as moratorium legislation, GM-free zones, licence conditions
       applying to economic assessment and comparisons of supply chain
       models, and contingency planning and insurance matters must be
       prepared and instigated prior to the release of GMOs.
	   
<p>       The Hon. Duncan Gay: Twynams is an interesting case because it
       grows GM cotton.
	   
<p>       The Hon. RICK COLLESS: Yes, but it is opposed to the release of GM
       canola.
	   
<p>       The Hon. Duncan Gay: And quite rightly so.
	   
<p>       The Hon. RICK COLLESS: Yes. Twynams is certainly a mainstream
       agriculture company. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition makes an
       interesting point. There are two distinct groups in this debate:
       those who farm organically for the sake of it and mainstream
       producers who have identified an advantage in selling to the
       organic market. We are obviously most concerned about those
       mainstream producers who see a huge benefit in producing crops
       with organic certification and gaining a subsequent market
       advantage.
	   
<p>       Non-GM farmers do not approve of the OGTR crop of management
       plans, which they say place unacceptable impositions on the non-GM
       grower. They believe the risk management assessment prepared by
       the OGTR does not address adequately the control of volunteer
       plants post harvest of the GM crop. Contrary to statements made by
       the OGTR, many farmers believe there is a major difference between
       GM-modified canola and non-GM canola and there is a need to keep
       GM crops and non-GM crops segregated at a far greater purity
       level. Farmers want other concerns to be addressed. They believe
       the five-metre buffer zone determined by the OGTR is insufficient
       to control contamination. GM canola becomes a weed and, unlike
       other weeds, it is impossible to remove from non-GM canola crops.
       The consequence and management of gene stacking has not been risk
       assessed adequately. Non-GM seed production is not possible under
       existing plans using 400-metre buffer zones. The exclusion of the
       risk assessment of economic and social risk is unreasonable and
       the OGTR must consider economics. There is no field testing kit
       available to detect contamination in non-GM crops.
	   
<p>       Licence conditions must identify GM canola as a notifiable crop.
       Neighbours must be notified that GM crops are being grown in order
       to ensure effective risk management. This requirement is
       consistent with requiring farmers who use herbicides such as
       endosulfan that have an impact on export markets to notify their
       neighbours of that usage. Cotton farmers who use that herbicide
       must notify their neighbours who run cattle to give them the
       opportunity to take appropriate action to avoid potential
       endosulfan contamination. The same regime should apply to
       genetically modified material. Responsibility for a contamination
       clean-up plan must be demanded of Bayer as part of the risk
       management of its product.
	   
<p>       The NCF argues that the results of recent research in Britain have
       shown that gene transfer from genetically modified food occurs
       within the guts of humans and that gene transfer from crops to
       nearby weeds is also higher than expected. In fact, that is openly
       acknowledged in the OGTR's risk assessment and risk management
       plan. The NCF also claims that other research from Canada and the
       United States of America suggests that the growing of crops that
       are genetically modified to be herbicide resistant could result in
       the increased use of some herbicides, with adverse health and
       environmental effects.
	   
<p>       Should the herbicide-resistant gene escape into non-GM crops and
       wild populations, higher herbicide concentrations would need to be
       applied in order to control the genetically modified weeds. Other
       concerns of the NCF are, first, that it is a difficult crop to
       contain as it is open-pollinating and spillages are commonplace.
       They are often evidenced on the side of the road and on railway
       lines, and throughout pasture and cereal crops volunteer plants
       are often seen in abundance. It is worth noting that recently the
       Government attempted to blame a canola seed spillage on a railway
       line for one of its Tangara trains suddenly accelerating. It
       claimed the canola seed on the line reduced the traction of the
       train, but I do not think anyone really believes that. Is that an
       open admission that it is impossible to keep canola seed in a rail
       truck?
	   
<p>       The second concern is that the Federal Government's GMO
       legislation deals only with health, safety and the environment and
       does not consider any commercial impacts. Third, conventional
       farmers will have to bear the costs of segregating GM seed at silo
       delivery points. These concerns must be addressed. The European GM
       ban and the Australian moratoria on the development of GM crops
       provide breathing space for proper and further research. This can
       be done with the proposed field trials. Paula Fitzgerald from
       Agrifood Awareness Australia confirms in her article "The Grains
       Millennium Opportunity or a Great Myth Overload" that canola may
       well be the next GM crop commercially available in Australia. She
       says that overseas, particularly in Canada, transgenic canola
       accounts for much of the canola grown.
	   
<p>       The canola industry in Canada recently commissioned a study to
       qualify and quantify the agronomic and economic impacts of
       transgenic canola. The study surveyed 650 growers in western
       Canada, with half answering questions on transgenic canola and the
       other half responding to questions on their conventional canola.
       In addition, 13 case studies were conducted with growers of both
       transgenic and conventional varieties. In answer to the question
       why they chose transgenic varieties, more than 50 per cent of
       growers said that the key benefit and motivator for adopting
       transgenics was more efficient weed control and ease of herbicide
       management in preventing weed resistance. Nineteen per cent noted
       better yield, better return and more profit.
	   
<p>       Ms Fitzgerald briefly summarised other findings from the study,
       which includes the finding that more than 80 per cent of growers
       of transgenic canola said that weed control was more effective and
       59 per cent said herbicide management to delay weed resistance was
       easier. In regard to managing volunteer canola, 76 per cent of
       growers of transgenic canola said that it was the same as or
       easier than managing conventional canola. On average, transgenic
       systems resulted in three bushels to the acre, or a 10 per cent
       yield advantage over conventional varieties in 2000. The growers
       of transgenic canola used less fuel due to fewer field
       operations--tillage, harrowing, fertiliser, less summer fallow, et
       cetera. Growers reported using slightly more fertiliser for
       transgenic canola, which translated to a higher cost when compared
       to conventional canola. Growers of transgenic canola used less
       herbicide than growers of conventional canola.
	   
<p>       These are all very desirable outcomes, but it is important that we
       do not substitute good agronomic science with untested and
       questionable biotechnology. Mal Peters, President of New South
       Wales Farmers, said recently that any trials must be tightly
       controlled, but big enough to test the claims of the biotechnology
       companies as to how the crops perform in the field, along with the
       capabilities of the supply chain and both domestic and
       international markets. There is a huge division in public opinion
       in New South Wales, and the only way to resolve it is to ensure
       that there is an economic assessment, based on scientific
       judgement sourced from an independent trial. I want more intensive
       research into variations in the amino acid and protein structure,
       and any potential variations to human health, animal health and
       environmental risks that may emanate from the broadscale
       production of GM canola.
	   
<p>       I do not believe that the research that has been carried out with
       mice is sufficient in the short term. We need to look at the
       long-term cumulative subclinical effects on various animal and
       plant species in the environment. I want much more research into
       the fundamental agronomic health of agricultural soils and the
       impact on crop, animal and human health. There is plenty of
       evidence around the world to suggest that healthy soils lead to
       healthy plants and healthy plants lead ultimately to healthy
       animals. If humans eat healthy plant and animal material they will
       ultimately be healthy. It is a tight-knit circle of which we need
       to be aware.
	   
<p>       Canola is a self-pollinating plant but cross-pollination is
       possible. It reproduces by wind and insect pollination with the
       potential for the pollen to disperse about a metre through plants
       brushing together in the wind. Also, canola pollen attracts a
       range of nectar-feeding and pollen-collecting insects, the most
       important of which is the honey bee. Beekeepers advise that bees
       regularly fly up to 10 kilometres in search of and to collect
       pollen, although there has been heated debate about that distance.
       Recently the Belgium Government refused to approve an application
       from Aventis to conduct field tests with GM herbicide-tolerant
       canola because the Belgium Minister for Consumer Interests, Health
       and Environment noted that pollen may be transferred up to four
       kilometres by bees.
	   
<p>       Generally, GM canola trial sites are separated by 400 metres from
       other Brassica crops--this is often referred to as a buffer
       zone--and the sites are surrounded by a 15-metre buffer of non-GM
       canola or a non-Brassica crop with a similar flowering time. In
       addition, a 50-metre zone around the site is monitored for
       sexually compatible species one month before planting, and from a
       week before the crop begins to flower until it stops flowering.
       Any sexually compatible plants found in the area must be removed.
       These guidelines are established to minimise the risk of any GM
       canola plants escaping from the site or of pollen spread. It is
       desirable that that process be implemented on the release of these
       field trials, but if it is to be implemented after the general
       release of GM canola it will result in considerable conditions
       being imposed on canola farmers.
	   
<p>       In reality, it will not happen and the escape of GM material into
       the wild populations will result. The OGTR's risk assessment and
       risk management plan acknowledges that the risks exist. It states
       that the risk of InVigor canola establishing as a weed is low and
       the transfer of introduced genes to non-GM canola crops is low. It
       states that there is potential for transfer of the introduced
       genes to weedy relatives of canola via outcrossing. The likelihood
       of transfer of the introduced genes to other organisms is also
       low. Even though the plan insists that the risks are low, the fact
       that they are acknowledged in any form concerns me.
	   
<p>       Last year much publicity was given to a Canadian grain farmer who
       came to Australia to spread the word that GM canola was safe. He
       addressed meetings all over this State. On 15 March the SBS
       program Insight claimed that the farmer, Bruce Dalgarno, was paid
       a daily allowance of $150 by Monsanto, plus his travel expenses.
       This caused a major scandal in Canada. Insight claimed that Paula
       Fitzgerald, from Agrifood Awareness Australia, knew of Bruce
       Dalgarno's links with Monsanto when it invited him to come to
       Australia. In May 1999, when Agrifood Awareness Australia was
       launched, it described itself as an industry initiative,
       established to increase public awareness of, and encourage
       informed debate about, gene technology.
	   
<p>       It says it is committed to providing quality, factual information
       on the use of gene technology in agriculture, and the implications
       this may have on the entire food chain. It is an alliance
       supported by three peak bodies: the National Farmers Federation,
       the Grains Research and Development Corporation and Avcare, which
       represents chemical companies including Monsanto and Bayer. The
       Grains Research and Development Corporation [GRDC] is one of the
       world's leading grains research organisations, responsible for
       planning, investing and overseeing research and development,
       delivering improvements in production, sustainability and
       profitability across the Australian grains industry.
	   
<p>       One has to ask how independent is the factual information being
       released by this organisation and why the National Farmers
       Federation so closely aligned itself. Insight also reported that
       new studies conducted by the Research Centre of the University of
       Adelaide recently suggest that the chance of contamination between
       GM canola and non-GM canola is extremely low. However, those
       studies were partially funded by--surprise, surprise--Monsanto and
       Bayer. The Gene Technology Grains Committee is a voluntarily
       established industry committee that has been given the role by the
       State Government to represent the grains industry. There is
       concern that there is no transparency or obvious criteria
       regarding guidelines for how this committee intends to involve or
       acknowledge industry stakeholders in its decisions.
	   
<p>       Many farmers have criticised the committee's protocols. The
       Network of Concerned Farmers has criticised the membership of the
       committee with a make-up of GM developers, 34 per cent; Avcare, 11
       per cent--an organisation funded by chemical and biotech
       companies; farm chemical suppliers, about 3 per cent; government,
       20 per cent; consultants, 3 per cent; grains industry lobby and
       research groups, 18 per cent; trading companies, 5 per cent; and
       the organic industry, 3 per cent. Insight claims that Avcare
       established this committee and runs its meetings. It was also
       claimed, and confirmed by the chairman of the Gene Technology
       Grains Committee, that Avcare paid for an outside consultant to
       prepare the chairman's public relations strategy. So how balanced
       is the debate out there? There is not enough research, not enough
       people being heard.
	   
<p>       On the other side of the argument is Dr Norman Borlaug, renowned
       as the father of the green revolution for his role in the
       development of miracle wheat and who assisted in developing
       high-yielding disease-resistant strains of wheat, transforming
       agriculture and averting famine in many parts of the world. Dr
       Borlaug has raised the interesting concept, which should appeal to
       many of my upper House colleagues, that growing more crops per
       acre leaves more land for nature and, furthermore, that without
       higher yields peasant farmers will continue to destroy wild lands
       and species to keep from starving. Sustainable higher yields could
       save both. The world is already farming 37 per cent of its land
       area, and the wild forests are what are left over after humans
       harvest their food and forest products.
	   
<p>       Currently there are 55 million hectares planted to GM crops
       globally. It is imperative that we push ahead with trials of
       genetically modified crops. We cannot afford to bury our heads in
       the sand over this issue. The biggest challenge that faces wealthy
       western nations such as Australia in the future is how we feed the
       150 to 180 people born every minute in developing countries. As I
       said earlier, we should not be forfeiting good science in
       agriculture for the adoption of trendy genetic engineering before
       all unknown aspects of the science and the potential pitfalls are
       fully researched. I am not opposed to genetic engineering per se,
       but I am opposed to genetic engineering before all the research is
       completed and when it is being promulgated as a solution to poor
       agricultural science. I look forward to the debate in Committee.
	   
<p>       Reverend the Hon. Dr GORDON MOYES [5.23 p.m.]: I note a number of
       criticisms of the bills. The Leader of the Christian Democratic
       Party indicated that we will support both bills in principle, but
       I foreshadow that in the Committee stages I will move an amendment
       that will answer some of the criticisms regarding membership of
       the advisory council, some of which were made by the Hon. Rick
       Colless, and the functions of the council. I feel sure the
       amendment will answer some of those criticisms that have already
       been made in the House. I foreshadow that I will recommend that
       the members of the advisory council should be representatives of
       the peak farming bodies, the grain industry, the department,
       environmental groups, the biotechnology industry and scientific
       research organisations, as well as an independent chair. I will
       also outline the functions of the advisory council. I mention that
       at this stage in the hope that it will obviate the concerns of
       some honourable members about those matters.
	   
<p>       The Hon. Dr PETER WONG [5.24 p.m.]: I will make only brief comment
       on these bills. It is obvious that the bills we are debating today
       have created great concerns for many Australians, including
       farmers, environmentalists and communities, as well as many
       members of Parliament. It is obvious also, from listening to the
       debate, that at present there are no answers to many questions
       that are being asked. I believe this is a clayton's moratorium. It
       is a done deal. What remains to be discussed is how we can protect
       the interests of at least some of our farmers, how to minimise the
       harmful impact of this proposal on our environment, and how to
       extract from the multinationals a better deal for our farmers and
       consumers.
	   
<p>       I have a feeling that, regretfully, we are being forced to debate
       and implement policy on genetically engineered foods, and that
       many Australians are not in favour of that policy. In this case we
       are being asked to follow an agenda that is not initiated by
       Australia itself. It is not a happy situation in which we find
       ourselves. Advocates of GE canola, for example, highlight the
       success of increased yields of up to 15 per cent. By the way,
       there was not even a guarantee by the providers of GE seeds. It
       was also claimed that GE canola requires less use of insecticides
       and herbicides. Again, this is a point that is debatable. One of
       the strongest arguments is that there is a strong market for GE
       canola oil; and, by the way, the whole world is going that way
       anyway, and why do we not follow?
	   
<p>       Even assuming that all those goals are achievable, albeit in a
       trendy way, a number of honourable members have mentioned that
       many farmers are concerned about the risks they must take for
       crops that are imposed upon them unnecessarily. No doubt, for
       some, their crops will be harder to sell. There is no doubt that
       the risk of crop contamination by GE canola is more than small.
       Worst of all, eventually those farmers affected may be asked to
       meet the costs of contamination themselves. Therefore, I am
       concerned that, on behalf of the New South Wales Government, we
       are forced to befriend biotech companies, and that in turn the
       livelihood of New South Wales farmers could be severely
       disadvantaged, without offering them or consumers a better choice.
	   
<p>       The Government obviously cannot guarantee that GE trial crops will
       not contaminate GE-free crops. Therefore, I do not believe at this
       stage that this pseudo moratorium represents the interests of, or
       will benefit, either consumers or farmers. We have to remember
       that at the moment New South Wales farmers are going through a
       drought. This proposal will only add to their plight. The
       pressures that farmers are under at present are already causing
       social impacts such as depression, suicide and family breakdowns.
	   
<p>       Ms LEE RHIANNON [5.29 p.m.]: I support my colleague Mr Ian Cohen,
       who has comprehensively outlined the growing concerns of people
       around the world about genetically engineered crops and produce.
       The common demand is that a moratorium be put in place while we
       learn more about the consequences of these crops. We can learn a
       great deal from some very interesting developments overseas. I
       refer specifically to the current situation in the Philippines,
       where a number of people have been on a hunger strike since 22
       April to oppose the introduction of a genetically modified corn
       crop, Bt corn, which is patented by Monsanto Corporation, and
       contains in every cell, including the grains, a built-in poison to
       kill the corn borer. This has created a number of problems,
       including the possible contamination of the local corn industry.
       As we have heard from previous speakers, once GM crops are in
       place, non-GM crops can be contaminated.
	   
<p>       Evidence of the damage that Bt corn can do to people's health is
       already available. A histopathologist from the United Kingdom, Dr
       Stanley Ewen, has warned that Bt corn can increase the risk of
       stomach and colon cancers. The hunger strikers in the Philippines
       are protesting about this variety of GE corn. These incredibly
       courageous people include Robert Verzola, a member of the
       Philippine Greens and a former member of the National Committee on
       Biosafety of the Philippines; his compatriot Luisita Esmao, who
       was unfortunately hospitalised on 10 May; Ann Larracas; and Father
       Robert Reyes. Their contribution and the significance of their
       protest are enormous because they reflect the degree of concern of
       people around the world with the introduction of GE crops, similar
       to that of the Greens and many other groups in Australia. I urge
       the new Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in the carriage of
       his first bill to do the right thing by the people and the
       environment of New South Wales.
	   
<p>       The Hon. IAN MACDONALD (Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries)
       [5.32 p.m.], in reply: I thank honourable members for their
       comments on the bills. On 3 March when the Government announced
       that it would proceed with these bills it was clear that a
       moratorium would be imposed on the commercial release of crops for
       primarily food consumption. Honourable members have had 2Â½ months
       to prepare themselves for the debate. In early May I announced in
       this House that the bill would be introduced on 20 May, it would
       be debated, and it was the Government's intention that it would be
       dealt with this week. I made that very clear-cut commitment in
       answer to a question during question time about what the
       Government was doing with the bills. Consequently, honourable
       members had plenty of time to ready themselves, and it is obvious
       from today's debate that they have prepared themselves well. They
       have provided a range of views on the application of genetically
       modification technology.
	   
<p>       I have listened intently to each speaker, and I intend to reply at
       some length to the objections and questions raised by each member.
       The bills provide a very workable and important regime. Together
       they will ensure that New South Wales participates effectively in
       the national scheme for the regulation of genetically modified
       organisms through the Federal Office of the Gene Technology
       Regulator [OGTR]. Participation in the national scheme will have
       significant advantages over this State trying to establish its own
       regulatory system. The Office of the Gene Technology Regulator
       will provide a transparent regulatory scheme with the strength
       that only a nationally consistent scheme can offer. The moratorium
       bill will guarantee that farmers and the broader community have
       the time to ensure that the potential of this technology for the
       betterment of humankind is achieved with an absolute minimum of
       adverse impact on the marketing potential of New South Wales both
       domestically and, more importantly, internationally of non-GM food
       plants.
	   
<p>       As I said, it is realistic to hope for plants that will either
       cope with environmental stresses, such as soil and water salinity,
       or even improve the environment to better compete with severe
       environmental weeds or the bioremediation of contaminated land.
       The Government is keen to ensure that this State does not miss out
       on the potential benefits promised by this technology. The science
       in this area and the world situation in regard to the marketing
       opportunities for GM crops and food products are moving so fast
       that a moratorium lasting any longer than three years, which the
       Opposition put forward during the election campaign, would pose a
       risk that this State could miss out on these benefits. Three years
       is adequate to consider these issues. The GM advisory committee I
       announced today will assist in reviewing the situation. The
       committee will investigate such matters as affecting the
       management of the GM moratorium on food crops as the Minister
       refers to it for investigation.
	   
<p>       The GM advisory committee will report to the Minister on advances
       in science that may affect the management and use of GM technology
       as it affects agriculture and related industries. It will provide
       a capacity to seek consensus from stakeholder members on important
       GMO matters, including marketing issues when GM crops are approved
       for release by the Gene Technology Regulator and GM food crop
       trials. A number of matters must be canvassed further than the
       contributions to the debate. I do not think a number of members
       understood the OGTR processes. The committees structured under the
       OGTR consist of a very broad range of individuals that encompasses
       thoroughly most of the aspects of the debate.
	   
<p>       During the debate and when referring to the Greens amendment, the
       Hon. Ian Cohen mentioned pollen being transferred by bees and he
       suggested that pollen could be spread over 10 kilometres from its
       source. My advice is that Australian investigations have shown
       that the vast majority of pollen travels less than 10 metres. In
       extreme cases when there is evidence of wind transfer it may
       travel up to 1.5 kilometres and up to 4 kilometres by insect
       transfer. The size of buffer zones to manage pollen transfer will
       vary with type, size and location of each research trial. The
       restriction of pollen transfer can be addressed on a case-by-case
       basis by requiring pollen traps to be located at trial sites and
       by requiring the GM plant to be bagged or covered when flowering.
       Those detailed protocols are required by the OGTR when issuing
       licences for research trials to address the unintended
       environmental contamination.
	   
<p>       The key issues raised by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition
       during his contribution to the debate included a request for a
       moratorium, more detail in the bill and a guarantee of zero
       contamination. My response is that we do not live in a world which
       guarantees zero risk in any area of human endeavour. No aspect of
       farming has a zero tolerance and there is no such guarantee in any
       part of life. Even the most stringent market for the importation
       of food in the world, the European Union, allows a tolerance of
       0.9 per cent for unintended GP contamination. The Deputy Leader of
       the Opposition also complained that the bill does not set out any
       details of the advisory council to which I referred in my second
       reading speech.
	   
<p>       The key points of clarification sought by the Deputy Leader of the
       Opposition are the functions of the council and its reporting
       obligations. I indicated clearly in my second reading speech the
       role and membership provisions relating to the advisory council. I
       would have thought it obvious that a ministerial advisory council
       report to the Minister. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition also
       commented that no grain marketing representative was proposed to
       be a member of the advisory council, and a similar concern was
       expressed by the Hon. Rick Colless. I indicated in my second
       reading speech that the Australian Wheat Board International would
       be invited to take up membership of the council.
	   
<p>       The Hon. Duncan Gay: We are pleased to hear that. Why was that not
       part of your press release?
	   
<p>       The Hon. IAN MACDONALD: As I stated, it was mentioned in my second
       reading speech. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition also mentioned
       that currently there are no details on how trials would be
       approved. He seeks clarification on what a Minister will take into
       account in deciding whether to approve a trial, what the size of
       required buffer zones will be, and what will happen to the
       material that is harvested from trials. He also points out that
       there is no appeal from grants of exemptions to orders for trials.
       As I indicated in my second reading speech, the details of
       research trial design are far too complex and variable for
       honourable members to expect them to be set out in detail in
       legislation. That subject is properly the domain of experts and
       should be dealt with by the advisory council.
	   
<p>       I also have indicated that the conditions imposed on the conduct
       of research trials under exemption orders would mirror those that
       the OGTR has imposed on trials under Commonwealth legislation. In
       other words, the protocols that will be in place for trials
       granted under exemption orders in this State will import the
       Federal rules for conduct of such trials. Licences for trials are
       available publicly on the OGTR web site and honourable members may
       see for themselves the detailed conditions that apply. It is not
       secret information: It is publicised on the Internet and
       honourable members are free to examine it.
	   
<p>       Issues mentioned by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, such as
       buffer zones, the fate of harvested material and lots of other
       issues, will be more than adequately addressed in exemption
       orders. While I give this undertaking, I must insist that these
       issues cannot be addressed in the legislation. I will refer all
       these points to the advisory council and require it to advise me
       on the conditions that should be imposed on the conduct of
       research trials under this legislation. I reiterate that under no
       circumstances will I permit trials to be conducted in New South
       Wales under less stringent conditions and standards than those
       imposed by the OGTR. I give that absolute guarantee.
	   
<p>       The Deputy Leader of the Opposition also pointed out that there is
       no right of appeal against the promulgation of an exemption order,
       especially for neighbours who may feel that their rights are being
       infringed by a trial that is being conducted on an adjoining
       property. This is another issue that I will refer to the advisory
       council. While I will require the council to conduct a rigorous
       examination of the issue and provide me with expert advice, I
       anticipate that exemption orders will require that immediate
       neighbours must be notified of a proposal to conduct a trial.
       Under the rules applying to the OGTR, I understand that that is
       already the practice. There are parallels in other aspects of
       life: for example, in an agricultural environment, a neighbour
       must be notified of a proposal to build on adjoining land, but
       that person will not necessarily be able to prevent the building
       from going ahead.
	   
<p>       While I do not accept that neighbours should have a total right of
       veto over the conduct of a trial, I will be guided by my advisory
       council, as I have already stated. During the debate the Deputy
       Leader of the Opposition also mentioned that the Australian Grain
       Harvesters Association has indicated its concerns over the
       production of GM crops as it believes that contamination is
       inevitable. As honourable members would know, large headers are
       not easy to clean, but header owners are already required to clean
       them at the New South Wales border to prevent contamination by
       Queensland wheat and they must also clean out the headers when
       moving from one type of crop to another. The Deputy Leader of the
       Opposition has sought to elevate this issue to a higher plane by
       seeking a guarantee of zero contamination.
	   
<p>       All food labelling standards allow a small tolerance for the
       unintended presence of genetically modified organisms [GMOs] and
       as I stated earlier it is unrealistic to expect zero tolerance. I
       have used contract harvesters a number of times on various crops
       grown on my property, including canola, and I would not allow a
       header to work on my property without making sure that it had been
       adequately cleaned. Concerns of that nature can be addressed, and
       they are currently being addressed under Commonwealth legislation.
       They can also be dealt with adequately in the protocols that have
       been implemented under the Commonwealth Act.
	   
<p>       The Australian Wheat Board will make a very good contribution to
       the advisory council. Some honourable members during the debate
       intimated that they had inferred the council would be a pro-GM
       body. However, my understanding from a reading of the literature
       relating to organisations that have sought representation on the
       advisory council is that probably the majority of council members
       will support the moratorium for various reasons. For example, they
       may not necessarily support the proposition that gene technology
       cannot be developed at some time in the future. That might be a
       position held by the Hon. Ian Cohen, but the council will no doubt
       adopt a sceptical approach to arrangements and protocols for the
       safe handling of GMOs to avoid contamination. I believe the
       representative organisations will examine the concept of trials in
       a comprehensive manner and will give a great deal of thought to
       how the trials should be conducted. I say that because I am
       convinced that they really want the answers.
	   
<p>       It is all very well for honourable members to be against the bill
       based on something they read on a web site indicating that the
       proposal has some type of downside. On that basis, they seek to
       prevent the Government from going ahead with its proposals. As I
       have stated very clearly in my second reading speech and
       throughout debate on the bill, the proposal is for scientific
       trials to be conducted. The proposal is not for the commercial
       release of canola at all. The trials are exactly what the
       Government has said they are--research trials based on proper
       proposals that are designed to operate effectively in meeting
       research criteria for addressing issues that may be important in
       the future. Having said all of that and despite my wish to debate
       many more of the points raised by the Hon. Ian Cohen and the Hon.
       Dr Arthur Chesterfield-Evans, I believe it is time to conclude the
       second reading debate. I commend the bill to the House.
	   
<l>       Motion agreed to.
	   
<l>       Bills read a second time.
	   
<l>       Committee consideration to stand as an order of the day.
	   
<l>       [The Deputy-President (The Hon. Tony Burke) left the chair at 5.50
       p.m. The House resumed at 8.00 p.m.]
