<h>   GREAT SOUTH LAND EXPLORATION LEASE 

<h>   Wednesday 24 November 2004

<p>   Mr FINCH (Question) - Mr President, would the Leader reveal what, if
   any, plans the Government has for the future of Great South Land's oil
   and gas exploration lease, SEL 13/98, which covers the eastern half of
   Tasmania?

<p>   As the Leader will be aware the Australian Financial Review reported
   on Friday that SEL 13/98 has just been renewed for a further five
   years, effectively tying up half of Tasmania for oil and gas
   exploration to an unlisted company whose chairman has stated that he
   is inspired by visions.

<p>   As the conditions of the lease require a reported exploration
   expenditure of $21 million, and Great South Land is reported to have
   capital of less than $13 000, how soon can the State Government ensure
   more effective exploration of lease SEL 13/98?

<l>   Mr Harriss - That would be on Mr Rattray's property, wouldn't it?

<l>   Mrs Rattray-Wagner - I will pass that on.

<l>   Mr AIRD - I thought you were going to make a land tax comment.

<p>   Mr President, I thank the honourable member for his question. The
   State Government is aware of Pierpont's article in last Friday's, that
   is 19 November 2004, Australian Financial Review but has no comment to
   make on the journalist's assessment on how a company is run.

<p>   From the Government's position, Great South Land Minerals Ltd - GSLM -
   was granted a special exploration licence for oil and gas exploration
   over 30 356 square kilometres of mainland Tasmania for five years from
   18 May 1999. GSLM applied for an extension of this special exploration
   licence over a reduced area on 6 May 2004. For the renewal the licence
   has been reduced to 15 035 square kilometres, approximately 50 per
   cent of the original area granted.

<p>   Renewal of exploration licences can be made provided the applicant
   demonstrates that they have the technical ability to carry out the
   proposed work program and the funds to undertake the agreed work
   program. As part of their renewal application, GSLM presented the
   Government with a letter from GEM Global Yield Fund - GGYF - London,
   which stated that GGYF had entered into an equity line of credit with
   GSLM to provide up to Â£150 million to finance exploration for oil and
   gas in the Tasmanian basin.

<p>   The renewal was granted on the basis that the licensee intends to
   spend $21.5 million on exploration during the renewal period to define
   or disprove commercial quantities of oil or gas. As a condition of
   renewal, GSLM have agreed to meet additional licence conditions that
   will ensure that the community gets a fair return from allocation of
   such a large area. These conditions are as follows:

<l> · GLSM has provided a staged expenditure budget of $21.5 million over
   five years.
   
<l> · The Government requires GLSM to meet 80 per cent of cumulative
   expenditure commitment at the end of each year of the licence. Failure
   to meet this critical condition will result in revocation of the
   licence.

<l> · Expenditure claimed under the licence must be consistent with
   industry charges current at the time of the claim.
   
<l> · Expenses significantly higher than industry standards will not be
   accepted.
   
<l> · Copies of all receipts shall be provided for consulting fees claimed
   as expenditure.
   
<l> · MRT will be provided with copies of reports or advice from
   consultants to substantiate such claims.

<p>   GSLM shall provide a review of exploration activities to Mineral
   Resources Tasmania - MRT - on 1 April and 1 October in each year and
   GSLM shall provide a full interpretation report for the seismic work
   carried out between January 2001 and June 2001. This report must be
   provided to MRT by 1 December 2004.

<p>   The Minister for Infrastructure, Energy and Resources has already
   publicly announced a renewal of the Great South Land licence in a
   media release on Friday 29 October. The media release also included
   details of various licence conditions, as previously mentioned.
