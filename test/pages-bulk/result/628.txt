<h> Suddenly Simple

<p>   My `earthshaking' (for me anyhow) revelation on Monday has continued
   to variously wreak havoc and incite bliss in my consciousness (not to
   mention my dreamwork).  Truly, the shift in consciousness I
   experienced in my truck at that moment was a massive perceptual
   re-arrangement.  A bit scary, but endurable particularly given the
   ramification of the insight in almost every area of my life.  Despite
   the $0.10USD words and elaborate psychological theories involved in
   this insight, the integration that followed has lead to a very simple
   experiential awareness applicable to most anything I have encountered
   in the last two days.  Even at a corporate level my application of
   this new knowledge was accepted, respected, and assisted in furthering
   conceptualization of a multi-national dilemma, eventually to result in
   a book in an unrelated field, but for which I have supplied the title
   and premise.

<p>   Interpersonally, I have been struggling somewhat with this in a
   particular setting in which understanding is easily misinterpreted as
   sickness.  However, my spiritual guide has assured me that a massive
   progression toward clarity has been set in motion and my discomfort is
   largely around the potential for conflict that this new knowledge
   lends.  Fortunately, great suggestion was afforded me, and taken
   wholeheartedly, in how to manage conflict and differences of opinion
   in this particular social milieu.

<p>   It is surprising to me how my extreme desperation, and eventual
   submission through exhaustion, continues to be an integral part of my
   growth.  In accepting this, I was initially dismayed at the
   unfamiliarity of being undeniably and consumingly lost.  I see now
   that this is precisely the step that is required for increased
   awareness.  To relent in direction finding allows one to observe
   reality for what it is: a falsehood, a misperception.  Only then may
   one process the surroundings for what they truly are, be found, and
   select (yes, choice) a direction for conscious movement.  I do not
   think that makes much sense and is poorly articulated, but hopefully
   it will remind me of the basic concept I had in mind this morning.

<p>   Three more books on Taoist philosophy arrived today from Amazon.
   Unfortunately, I have been given a deadline for a major task and will
   not be able to enjoy them any time soon. I will instead attempt to
   complete six months of work in two days: Saturday and Sunday.  I may
   or may not succeed, but I will certainly succeed in trying.  For now,
   I continue addressing the next most pressing project.

<p>   Job #2 changed drastically today as I made a new beginning.  This time
   around, the subject matter involved in the work is dear to me and
   something that I am enthusiastic about.  Some might even suggest I
   have a certain expertise in the subject.  I continue to fight this
   presumptuous assertion, but must admit that my reasoning for attempt
   at remaining humble is based on a fine understanding of the
   fundamental tenets.  Again, a paradoxical endeavor, but one that I
   most fully appreciate and revere, thus lending me what they are
   calling `expertise.' Semantics is Chomsky's area.  I will stick to
   feelings in relationships.
