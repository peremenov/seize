      <h>RAY SUAREZ: 
	  <p>For more on Kabila's death and Congo's new president, we get 
      three views. Faida Mitifu is Democratic Republic of the Congo's ambassador 
      to the United States. Susan Rice served as Assistant Secretary of State 
      for African Affairs during the Clinton administration. And Philip 
      Gourevitch is a staff writer for The New Yorker magazine. He's written 
      extensively about central Africa. Philip Gourevitch, who would want 
      Laurent Kabila dead and why? 
      <h>PHILIP GOUREVITCH: 
	  <p>Well, Laurent Kabila was never suffering from a 
      shortage of enemies. He was not a popular leader. He was a deeply 
      unpopular leader. And with time, he managed to stay in power largely by 
      playing off former allies against one another, and to do so both 
      externally, with countries that had supported his original rise to power 
      and playing them off against one another, but also internally. As time 
      went on, he became increasingly a man who ruled by a paranoid style of 
      government. And since he did not really govern so much as hold power, he 
      did nothing for the people or for the country. He simply maintained power 
      and maintained his name attached to the presidency. He consistently 
      consolidated his power more and more in the hands of an ethnic base from 
      his home province of Katanga. There was a clique within the government and 
      also within the military. And there seems to have been a good deal of 
      disgruntlement amongst those who saw their position in the country being 
      threatened by this Katangese core, as well as one hears lots of stories 
      about deep dissatisfaction with Kabila on the part of his external allies, 
      Angola and Zimbabwe, and to a lesser degree Namibia, who have essentially 
      propped him up in power while he faces a rebel and foreign threat in the 
      East. 
      <h>RAY SUAREZ: 
	  <p>Ambassador Mitifu, what has your government been able to 
      determine about the murder? Who was behind it? Who was interested in 
      having it happen? 
      <h>FAIDA MITIFU: 
	  <p>My government has abstained itself from pointing at anybody 
      so far. The investigation continues. We know that he has been shot by a 
      bodyguard, but whether the bodyguard acted on his... on himself or whether 
      somebody or someone or some organization was behind the bodyguard, we 
      don't know yet. We have some clues so far, but there are not enough to 
      really make a conclusive report about his murder. 
      <h>RAY SUAREZ: 
	  <p>Have there been threats to the president's life in the past? 
      <h>FAIDA MITIFU: 
	  <p>No, up until so far, no. There haven't been any threats on 
      the president's life except before the one that left the country when the 
      former chief of staff actually attempted to enter the provincial compound 
      with a silent revolver. But since then, I've never heard of any attempt on 
      the president's life. 
      <h>Government control of the country
      <h>RAY SUAREZ: 
	  <p>The government in Kinshasa and its new president, Joseph 
      Kabila, how much of this large country do they really control? 
      <h>FAIDA MITIFU: 
	  <p>Well, we control about half of the national territory, and 
      hopefully we'll be able to control and administer the entire country. We 
      control the entire western part of the country, and also a little more 
      than half of the central part of the country and a little bit toward the 
      north... northern part of the country. 
      <h>RAY SUAREZ: 
	  <p>Susan Rice, would you agree with that understanding of how far 
      the government in Kinshasa has really run? I mean, this is a place if you 
      put it over Western Europe, it would cover much of Western Europe. Do they 
      really control half the country? 
      <h>SUSAN RICE: 
	  <p>Half the country is under governmental control; roughly half 
      remains under rebel control. One of the difficulties in governing the 
      Congo historically even before the invasion of Rwanda and Uganda was the 
      fact that it's a vast country with limited infrastructure. And so in the 
      best of circumstances, the writ of the central government in Kinshasa is 
      relatively weak over the far-flung provinces. But as a matter of law and 
      as a matter of practical facts on the ground, until the invasion, 
      obviously the government in Kinshasa had sovereign control over the 
      entirety of Congo's territory, and now it's about 50 percent. 
      <h>RAY SUAREZ: 
	  <p>Does the killing of President Kabila create new circumstances 
      that might create an opening for peace, for settlement between warring 
      factions, or does it create a recipe for more chaos in the short term? 
      <h>SUSAN RICE: 
	  <p>I think it's very difficult to tell, Ray, in a short term 
      what's going to come about in the Congo. One would certainly hope that any 
      change, and this change in particular, might lead to greater resolve on 
      the part of the government and the people of Congo, as well as the 
      belligerents fighting in the Congo to see peace finally come to pass. That 
      would mean all of the concerned parties redoubling their efforts to 
      implement the Lusaka agreement, which was signed in 1999, which remains, 
      in my judgment, the most viable basis for peace in the Congo. It has the 
      elements that can lead to the withdrawal of foreign forces, 
      democratization and opening of political space, as well as the necessary 
      steps to rid the Congo of rebel elements that have been destabilizing 
      Congo's neighbors. 
      <h>RAY SUAREZ: 
	  <p>Ambassador, why was the Lusaka accord never put into place? 
      Why did the UN force never take up its positions in your country? 
      <h>The Lusaka accord
      <h>FAIDA MITIFU: 
	  <p>I believe it's because the Lusaka accord has lots of flaws 
      in it. I remember even when it was signed, journalists commenting the 
      Lusaka accord that it was an accord that was almost impossible to 
      implement. You will remember that when we signed the Lusaka accord, the 
      international community had not recognized yet Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi 
      as armies of occupation. It was talking about rebels. It was talking 
      about, of course, the inter-Congolese dialogue, which we are and still are 
      committed to. And it tended to tie directly the Congolese dialogue with 
      the withdrawal of foreign forces, and it was... in the beginning it was 
      difficult because also the UN as well also trailed its feet before sending 
      in observers. So there was a lot of problems, and there were also, in the 
      country, most people believed that we should not negotiate the integrity 
      of our territory. Also, Lusaka was not popular, because the people felt as 
      if they were not consulted when it was signed and they didn't feel like 
      they were bound to Lusaka. So there was that internal pressure also on our 
      government.
      <h>RAY SUAREZ: 
	  <p>Philip Gourevitch, maybe you could give us a quick look at who 
      is on the ground there. What foreign armies have taken up positions inside 
      the country, and how do they rack up against each other? 
      <h>PHILIP GOUREVITCH: 
	  <p>Well, essentially, the country is divided in half, east 
      to west. And in the east, you have Uganda and Rwanda, who are backing 
      rebel movement, some of which are fairly substantial and have a fair 
      amount of internal structure, and some of which are really proxy puppet 
      movements. And they occupy about half of the country, and they are 
      fighting generally together against two forces: The government formally of 
      Laurent Kabila and now handed off by his cronies to his son, without, of 
      course, any consultation whatsoever with the will of the Congolese people; 
      and also fighting against the former genocidal militias of the Rwandan 
      genocide, who are alive with Kabila's government. 
      <p>To a large degree, Kabila's decision to ally with these genocider provoked 
      the current war, and various other factions. There's Burundi in the east, 
      there's Uganda fighting some of its own issues. On the other side, 
      basically Kabila's army really was unable to... Kabila was never able to 
      defend his own territory; he was supported in the war by Angola and 
      Zimbabwe primarily, and to a lesser degree Namibia. Some troops came in 
      from Chad, but they were badly beaten and withdrew. Libya's Colonel 
      Qaddafi has consistently supported that struggle as well on behalf of the 
      Kabila regime. So right now really -- and this is what one saw today at 
      the funeral of Kabila -- the primary security force of the so-called 
      government of the Congo is, in fact, Zimbabwe and Angolan troops. So you 
      have a country divided between two vying groups of foreign alliances who 
      are probably going to have to negotiate or fight out what will come next, 
      which is deeply uncertain. 
      <h>RAY SUAREZ: 
	  <p>Well, Susan Rice, the new administration now finds itself with 
      this new or old/new problem, a huge and unstable country in the heart of a 
      continent that they're just now trying to come to grips with. What's on 
      tap for America as it looks to Central Africa? 
      <h>SUSAN RICE: 
	  <p>I think the United States' interest in Central Africa and the 
      Congo remain consistent. And our approach is unlikely to change 
      dramatically under the new administration. We have strongly backed the 
      Lusaka agreement. We continue to think it's viable and important to be 
      implemented. I would have to respectfully disagree with the ambassador 
      about the reasons for Lusaka's failure. It was a complicated agreement, 
      but it was inherently a balanced agreement. It had something in it for 
      everybody, first and foremost for the people of Congo, who would get their 
      sovereignty restored and a democratic process under way. Secondly, 
      security for Rwanda's neighbors, which as Philip correctly said, has been 
      a critical issue and one of the precipitating factors in the conflict. And 
      of course the withdrawal of the foreign forces, which is part of the 
      restoration of sovereignty. The reason the agreement wasn't implemented is 
      because the signatories didn't abide by their commitments. And in 
      particular, President Kabila's government failed to implement its end of 
      the deal. Now there's blame to go around, and all of the sides share in 
      that. But I think it's particularly important to note that President 
      Kabila and his government blocked, for a long time, the deployment of the 
      United Nations -- it wasn't that the UN was dragging its feet -- and made 
      it very difficult for Congo's allies, even those from Angola and Zimbabwe 
      who have a greater interest in seeing Lusaka effectively implemented to 
      get on with the business of peace in the region and developing their own 
      countries. 
      <h>RAY SUAREZ: 
	  <p>Is peace possible in your country in the near term? 
      <h>FAIDA MITIFU: 
	  <p>Absolutely, peace is possible. Peace is possible because we 
      are committed to peace. If in this government and Joseph's leadership 
      during this interim period, is committed to peace. We're calling him a 
      president who is actually residing during this short time, which is the 
      interim period, because we want, and have always wanted, that the new 
      leader of the DRC will have to have the mandate of the people. We are 
      committed to elections. Last time when President Kabila was in New York, 
      he said that again, and renewed his commitment, actually, to elections in 
      the country. That's very important for us. 
      <h>RAY SUAREZ: 
	  <p>Madam Ambassador, guests, thank you very much.
