      <h>MARGARET WARNER: 
	  <p>Amb. Negroponte, welcome, and thanks for being with us. 

      <p>We have heard roughly that there was a 60 percent turnout. What is the 
      latest you can tell us or what more do you know about the ethnic breakdown 
      of the turnout, ethnic and religious?
      <h>AMB. JOHN NEGROPONTE: 
	  <p>I think it's very difficult to say at this time. The 
      Independent Iraqi Electoral Commission has even pulled back a bit from 
      giving out any estimates, and I think we're going to have to wait for the 
      next day or two before we get some reliable turnout figures.
      <p>But clearly there's going to be important representation from the Kurdish 
      areas, from the Shiia groups, from the non-sectarian parties based here in 
      Baghdad, and probably slightly lesser representation in terms of the 
      proportions on the part of the Sunni people living in the so-called Sunni 
      Triangle area.
      <h>Constructing a future
      <h>MARGARET WARNER: 
	  <p>And give us your sense of how soon, just in practical 
      terms, we'll actually see this transitional national assembly sit down to 
      meet?
      <h>AMB. JOHN NEGROPONTE: 
	  <p>Well, of course, this is the first time that all 
      this is happening, so none of us have much of an experience base to refer 
      back to, but the results are supposed to be known in the next seven or ten 
      days; I think then there's allowance for perhaps challenges and so forth, 
      so let's assume a couple of weeks until the results are finally certified. 

      <p>And then it will take some time for the new assembly to organize itself 
      and its first act will be to pick a new presidency, which it will have to 
      select by a two-thirds vote, so that could take several weeks time.
      <h>MARGARET WARNER: 
	  <p>Now of course an overriding issue is how to get the 
      Sunnis to participate in this political process that's about to unfold. 
      How do you think that is going to go?
      <h>AMB. JOHN NEGROPONTE: 
	  <p>Well, first it is an important issue. I wouldn't 
      call it "the" overriding issue, by any means. I think the overriding issue 
      is to move the democratic process in this country forward and yesterday 
      was a major advance in that direction. 
      <p>Now, as far as the involvement of Sunni or any other groups, what we've 
      heard from the political leaders who are candidates in this election is 
      that they want to take an inclusive approach towards the future political 
      life of this country. 
      <p>So, I think you're going to see efforts to involve the Sunni in the new 
      executive branch, through cabinet positions and the like, and I think 
      there is also the intention to try and involve them in various ways in the 
      drafting of a new constitution. 
      <p>Because under the interim constitution of Iraq, any combination of three 
      provinces at the time of the referendum on the constitution can block 
      ratification. So, it's very much in the interest of all concerned if only 
      to get the constitution ratified to include representation from all 
groups.
      <h>MARGARET WARNER: 
	  <p>Are you personally in touch with senior members of what's 
      been called the Sistani Slate, even though we know he was neither a 
      candidate nor officially endorsed, but the United Iraqi Alliance, the 
      Shiite-dominated slate, that is expected to get the greatest number of 
      votes. I mean, do you have a personal reading of what their intentions 
are?
      <h>AMB. JOHN NEGROPONTE: 
	  <p>Well, we at various levels in our embassy, right 
      down to our political reporting officers we have maintained contact with 
      all segments of the Iraqi political spectrum and of course some of the 
      members of the Sistani List are people who are either in the government - 
      such as the finance minister, for example, or the vice president -- and 
      others are individuals whom we knew when there was a - a governing council 
      at the time of the coalition provisional authority, so I would say that 
      we're quite well acquainted with representatives of that list and in 
      fairly constant dialogue with them.
      <h>Encouraging participation
      <h>MARGARET WARNER: 
	  <p>Now what about the Sunni leaders who urged a boycott? 
      They have at least given interviews in which they said they want to be 
      part of the process, but what more can you tell us about their intention? 
      <h>AMB. JOHN NEGROPONTE: 
	  <p>Well, there is no monolithic Sunni leadership to my 
      understanding, which is perhaps one of the issues that has been a 
      complicating factor. 
      <p>But certainly we have maintained contact with a variety of leaders from 
      the Al-Anbar and Nineveh Provinces, which is where many of these Sunnis 
      reside. 
      <p>I have myself, for example, been in occasional contact with the leader of 
      the Iraqi Islamic Party, which is Sunni-dominated. So, again, we have 
      reached out to those groups and intend to continue to do so in the weeks 
      and months ahead.
      <h>MARGARET WARNER: 
	  <p>But do you think that - first of all - the fact of 
      yesterday's election, the relatively high turnout, do you think this is 
      going to from what you know make them feel more estranged and alienated 
      or, in fact, encourage them that, you know, this train is leaving the 
      station, to use an old political cliché, and they should get involved?
      <h>AMB. JOHN NEGROPONTE: 
	  <p>Right. I think it's actually encouraging them to 
      want to get on the train. In fact, I think initially a number of them were 
      really trying to test the system to see if they could somehow or another 
      cause a delay in the elections. 
      <p>But when the inevitability of the elections became apparent, I think we 
      saw a number of these Sunni groups and certainly Sunni voters want to 
      participate more in the political process and for example members of some 
      of the Sunni parties that were not actively involved in the election have 
      already indicated to us that they would like in some way to be involved in 
      the drafting of the constitution. 
      <p>So rather than having a polarizing effect, as some have suggested, I think 
      this election could well, in the end, have a unifying consequence. 
       
       
       
       
       
       
       
       

      <h>Formulating an exit strategy
      <h>MARGARET WARNER: 
	  <p>And what do you think - again the fact of yesterday's 
      election and the results means for the prospect of getting American troops 
      out of Iraq? 
      <h>AMB. JOHN NEGROPONTE: 
	  <p>Well, first of all, it's certainly a very important 
      step in terms of the government and the people of Iraq taking on even 
      greater ownership for the management of their own affairs. 
      <p>So it's been a very, very important advance towards political democracy. I 
      think parallel to that one of our highest priorities going forward is 
      going to be to train and equip and try to help motivate Iraqi armed 
      forces, their military and their police forces, so that they can take on 
      an ever -- a greater responsibility for their own security. 
      <p>We'd like to see a gradual shift from us being out on the lead on security 
      issues to the Iraqi forces being in the lead so that we can reduce our 
      profile.
      <h>MARGARET WARNER: 
	  <p>Some of these parties started this campaign by saying 
      they wanted U.S. troops out quickly. And that did seem to shift toward the 
      end. 
      <p>Again, how do you read their intentions - I'm talking now about for the 
      United Iraqi Alliance, perhaps a couple of the other major parties, in 
      terms of whether they want to at least start talking about a timetable for 
      withdrawal?
      <h>AMB. JOHN NEGROPONTE: 
	  <p>Well, a timetable was mentioned in some of the 
      campaign documents of some of these parties. But when we spoke to many of 
      these political leaders, they clarified that they didn't want to mean to 
      suggest that coalition forces should leave the country precipitously; in 
      fact, many of them have said to us that they think that would be dangerous 
      and would leave a serious vacuum. 
      <p>On the other hand, I think they feel, and I think on this point we agree 
      with them, that it is important that Iraqi forces themselves be enabled as 
      rapidly as possible to take over the primary responsibility for their 
      security and ultimately to take over full responsibility for the security 
      situation in their own country. 
      <p>And I think that's an objective that our two countries share in common.
       <h>Defending against attacks
       <h>MARGARET WARNER: 
	   <p>I know you're not a military expert, but the interior 
      minister was quoted or the interim interior minister was quoted yesterday 
      - he thought it would take perhaps 18 months for the full Iraqi security 
      forces to be able to handle things on their own? Does that sound 
      reasonable to you?
      <h>AMB. JOHN NEGROPONTE: 
	  <p>Well, we've been reluctant to try and put a 
      timetable on this to give a time estimate simply because we don't want to 
      create some kind of expectation that then subsequently might lead to a 
      disappointment. 
      <p>But what I can assure you is that we really are working extremely hard on 
      this issue of training, equipping, and motivating of the Iraqi armed 
      forces. And I would give to you as an example the extremely good 
      performance that they displayed yesterday in protecting these 5,300 
      polling centers throughout the country. 
      <p>The Iraqi forces deserve a tremendous amount of credit for the success of 
      yesterday's election.
      <h>MARGARET WARNER: 
	  <p>Now this 72-hour lockdown does end tomorrow. Are you 
      braced for insurgent attacks?
      <h>AMB. JOHN NEGROPONTE: 
	  <p>Well, one never knows exactly what to predict. Of 
      course, there's been a pattern, a fairly steady pattern of violence in 
      recent weeks and months. 
      <p>Obviously, we're doing our best to control and stabilize those situations 
      and hopefully some of the lessons learned from the experience of preparing 
      for the elections will be helpful going forward. But I'd be very wary of 
      trying to predict for you exactly what might happen in the next few days. 
      <p>I think that it is reasonable to expect that this insurgency will continue 
      for sometime to come and that the best way to deal with it is to keep 
      steadily working away at it through political action, such as these 
      elections, through training and equipping and motivating of their armed 
      forces and the economic reconstruction activities that we have underway. 
      <p>And I think through that combination of measures, I think that we over 
      time will be able to effectively deal with the insurgency that Iraq is 
      facing.
      <h>MARGARET WARNER: 
	  <p>Amb. John Negroponte, thanks for being with us.
      <h>AMB. JOHN NEGROPONTE: 
	  <p>Thank you very much.
