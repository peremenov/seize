            by Peter Tyson   

      <p>For most of his adult life, from about the age of 30 until his death at 78 
      in the year 1642, Galileo propounded his theory of how the tides work. Yet 
      a lengthy summary of our understanding of the tides that the British 
      physicist Lord Kelvin published in 1882 mentions Galileo only in passing. 
      <p>Why the cursory treatment? Because Galileo's theory of the tides, while 
      extremely well thought out and eminently reasonable considering the state 
      of scientific knowledge at the time, was wrong. Indeed, it was the most 
      significant stumble in an otherwise brilliant scientific career. A look 
      back at Galileo's big mistake offers clues to how and why such a great 
      thinker could have made it, and what lessons it can offer us today. 


       <h>A planet like a barge  
      <p>It was in 1595 when Galileo, just shy of his 30th birthday, first came up 
      with his explanation for the tides. The idea occurred to him while 
      traveling on a barge that was ferrying freshwater to Venice. (Galileo 
      lived in nearby Padua and often visited Venice.) He noticed that whenever 
      the barge's speed or direction altered, the freshwater inside sloshed 
      around accordingly. If the vessel suddenly ground to a halt on a sandbar, 
      for instance, the water pushed up towards the bow then bounced back toward 
      the stern, doing this several times with ever decreasing agitation until 
      it returned to a level state. 
      <p>Galileo realized that the Earth's dual motion—its daily one around its 
      axis and its annual one around the sun—might have the same effect on 
      oceans and other great bodies of water as the barge had on its freshwater 
      cargo. The key, as Galileo saw it, was that even though we don't sense it, 
      different parts of our planet move at different speeds depending on the 
      time of day. It's as if the Earth were a barge, which sped up, slowed 
      down, and periodically changed direction. 
      <p>In his "Treatise on the Tides," a paper he wrote in 1616, Galileo used a 
      diagram to explain why he thought this was true (see animated version at 
      right above). In this animation, the Earth revolves in a counterclockwise 
      direction both on its axis and around the sun. 
      <p>Galileo demonstrated that the combination of the two motions—the so-called 
      "absolute motion"—is always fastest on the part of the circle near A, 
      because that part is moving in the same direction for both the daily and 
      annual movements. And it is always slowest on the part of the circle near 
      B, because that part is moving in opposite directions for the daily and 
      annual movements. He determined that because the two absolute motions are 
      additive on one side of the globe and subtractive on the other, the 
      extreme ends of any sufficiently large basin of water, such as the 
      Mediterranean Sea, would be moving at different speeds. The daily 
      acceleration and deceleration of that body of water, he reasoned, effects 
      a sloshing within it—the tides. 
      <p>The chief objection to Galileo's argument was that his model should have 
      called for only one high tide a day, whereas there are roughly two. 
      Galileo explained this away by stating that many other factors play a role 
      in creating a specific tidal situation. These include the length of a 
      basin, its orientation, its depth, the shape of its coasts, the effect of 
      winds, and so forth. 


       <h>A sensible theory  
      <p>Galileo thought he had discovered the correct explanation for the tides, 
      one that would sink the other leading hypothesis of the day—namely, that 
      the moon triggered the tides. In 1609, the German mathematician Johannes 
      Kepler had written, "The sphere of influence of the attraction which is in 
      the moon extends as far as the Earth, and incites the waters up from the 
      torrid zone...." But because Kepler and other proponents of the moon 
      theory could offer no scientific explanation for such influence, Galileo, 
      who worked strictly on the basis of what he could see with his own eyes, 
      found it impossible to believe; the theory smacked of the occult, he 
      declared. (It wasn't until Sir Isaac Newton published his law of universal 
      gravitation in 1687 that Kepler's "attraction" gained a firm scientific 
      footing. Today, of course, most schoolchildren know that Kepler was right: 
      the moon's gravitational tug gives rise to the tides.) 
      <p>Galileo also thought his tidal theory provided powerful support for the 
      notion that the Earth revolved around the sun (and not the other way 
      around, as virtually everyone in the world then believed). This notion was 
      first advanced in the mid-16th century by the Polish astronomer Nicolaus 
      Copernicus, who maintained that our planet's rotation and revolution 
      around the sun accounted for the apparent movement of the heavenly bodies. 
      Galileo believed in the Copernican rather the Ptolemaic system, which had 
      held sway ever since Aristotle and his successor Ptolemy. The Ptolemaic 
      view, that the Earth was the center of the universe and all heavenly 
      bodies revolved around it, was insinuated by Catholic teachings to be 
      supported by the Bible and was therefore upheld by the Vatican. 
      <p>Even as he published his tidal theory in 1616, however, Galileo may have 
      had some lingering doubts about it. At the end of the "Treatise," he says 
      he hopes his idea "does not turn out to be delusive, like a dream which 
      gives a brief image of truth followed by an immediate certainty of 
      falsity. This I submit to the judgment of intelligent investigators." Such 
      scientific investigators would not appear for some time, and then, alas, 
      they would judge him wrong. 


       <h>In deep water  
      <p>In the meantime, Galileo had to face investigators of a different stripe: 
      inquisitors. Within two months, the Inquisition placed Copernicus's book 
      on the Index of Prohibited Books. Called before the Pope's theological 
      adviser, Roberto Cardinal Bellarmino, Galileo was forced to agree not to 
      defend or hold Copernicus's doctrine. 
      <p>For years, Galileo kept his thoughts on the matter close to his chest, but 
      eventually he could contain himself no longer. He fervently believed 
      Copernicus was right, and he would tell the world. In 1632, Galileo 
      published his Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems. During the 
      six years he had labored on it, Galileo's working title for the book had 
      been On the Flux and Reflux of the Sea, and indeed, he reprised his 1616 
      argument in the last of the book's four sections. 
      <p>All the old arguments were there. At one point, for example, one of the 
      book's three main characters, Salviati, who is a thinly disguised stand-in 
      for Galileo, says, "Among all the famous men who have philosophized [about 
      the tides], I wonder more at Kepler than any of the rest. Though he is a 
      free and acute genius, he has lent his assent to the moon's dominance over 
      the oceans and to other occult happenings and other such trifles." 
      <p>In a dramatic way, Galileo also broke his promise to obey the Church's 
      mandate not to espouse the Copernican system. The Dialogue represents, as 
      another superior thinker, Albert Einstein, put it in a foreword to a 1953 
      edition of the book, "a downright roguish attempt to comply with this 
      order in appearance and yet in fact to disregard it. Unfortunately, it 
      turned out that the Holy Inquisition was unable to appreciate adequately 
      such subtle humor." Galileo was placed under house arrest and the Dialogue 
      banned. 


       <h>A strenuous quest  
      <p>Einstein had keen insights on why Galileo acted so rashly. First of all, 
      it was Galileo's longing to find a mechanical proof of the Earth's motion, 
      Einstein felt, that misled him into not only formulating but clinging so 
      tenaciously to his flawed theory on the tides. The planet's motion 
      accounts for the tides, Galileo posited, and the tides account for the 
      planet's motion—it was all so neat. Moreover, all Galileo's astronomical 
      observations convinced him that Copernicus was correct, and he wanted 
      desperately to prove that fact scientifically. As Einstein put it, "His 
      aim was to substitute for a petrified and barren system of ideas the 
      unbiased and strenuous quest for a deeper and more consistent 
      comprehension of the physical and astronomical facts." 
      <p>Even Galileo's greatest blunder reveals his greatest strength as a 
      scientist. Referring to the tidal theory, Stillman Drake, a leading 
      Galileo scholar, once wrote, "The prime source of Galileo's effectiveness 
      was his bringing together of mathematics, astronomy, and physics in an 
      inseparable relationship. Hence even a questionable example of such a 
      relationship given by him was still capable of revealing to others what 
      sort of thing should be sought after in constructing a scientific 
      explanation." For another view of Galileo's contribution, see His Place in 
      Science.) 
      <p>That is, even though Galileo was wrong in this instance, he was right 
      about the direction of science (and showed it by example): away from a 
      more speculative, deductive approach and towards a more empirical, 
      experimental method. Galileo didn't make it into Lord Kelvin's seminal 
      paper on the tides. But for all his work, including his tidal theory, he 
      secured a place in history as the first modern scientist.  
        
             
                  <p>Galileo thought the tides occurred because of the Earth's 
                  daily rotation around its axis and its yearly circuit around 
                  the sun. For his reasoning, and an explanation of this 
                  animation, see main text at left. 




             <p>Galileo appears before the Inquisition, circa 1632, in a 
                  19th-century painting by Joseph-Nicolas Robert-Fleury. 




             <p>In the only mention of Galileo in his classic 1882 treatise 
                  on the tides, Lord Kelvin wrote that the Italian astronomer 
                  found the idea that the moon caused the tides "a lamentable 
                  piece of mysticism...."
