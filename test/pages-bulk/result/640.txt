      <h>Introduction
      <h>Performance Appraisal 

      <p>The history of performance appraisal is quite brief. Its roots in the 
      early 20th century can be traced to Taylor's pioneering Time and Motion 
      studies. But this is not very helpful, for the same may be said about 
      almost everything in the field of modern human resources management.

      <p>As a distinct and formal management procedure used in the evaluation of 
      work performance, appraisal really dates from the time of the Second World 
      War - not more than 60 years ago.

      <p>Yet in a broader sense, the practice of appraisal is a very ancient art. 
      In the scale of things historical, it might well lay claim to being the 
      world's second oldest profession!

      <p>There is, says Dulewicz (1989), "... a basic human tendency to make 
      judgements about those one is working with, as well as about oneself." 
      Appraisal, it seems, is both inevitable and universal. In the absence of a 
      carefully structured system of appraisal, people will tend to judge the 
      work performance of others, including subordinates, naturally, informally 
      and arbitrarily. 
      <p>The human inclination to judge can create serious motivational, ethical 
      and legal problems in the workplace. Without a structured appraisal 
      system, there is little chance of ensuring that the judgements made will 
      be lawful, fair, defensible and accurate.

      <p>Performance appraisal systems began as simple methods of income 
      justification. That is, appraisal was used to decide whether or not the 
      salary or wage of an individual employee was justified.
      <p>The process was firmly linked to material outcomes. If an employee's 
      performance was found to be less than ideal, a cut in pay would follow. On 
      the other hand, if their performance was better than the supervisor 
      expected, a pay rise was in order.
      <p>Little consideration, if any, was given to the developmental possibilities 
      of appraisal. If was felt that a cut in pay, or a rise, should provide the 
      only required impetus for an employee to either improve or continue to 
      perform well. 

      <p>Sometimes this basic system succeeded in getting the results that were 
      intended; but more often than not, it failed.
      <p>For example, early motivational researchers were aware that different 
      people with roughly equal work abilities could be paid the same amount of 
      money and yet have quite different levels of motivation and performance.

      <p>These observations were confirmed in empirical studies. Pay rates were 
      important, yes; but they were not the only element that had an impact on 
      employee performance. It was found that other issues, such as morale and 
      self-esteem, could also have a major influence.
      <p>As a result, the traditional emphasis on reward outcomes was progressively 
      rejected. In the 1950s in the United States, the potential usefulness of 
      appraisal as tool for motivation and development was gradually recognized. 
      The general model of performance appraisal, as it is known today, began 
      from that time.

       <h>Modern Appraisal 
      <p>Performance appraisal may be defined as a structured formal interaction 
      between a subordinate and supervisor, that usually takes the form of a 
      periodic interview (annual or semi-annual), in which the work performance 
      of the subordinate is examined and discussed, with a view to identifying 
      weaknesses and strengths as well as opportunities for improvement and 
      skills development.
      <p>In many organizations - but not all - appraisal results are used, either 
      directly or indirectly, to help determine reward outcomes. That is, the 
      appraisal results are used to identify the better performing employees who 
      should get the majority of available merit pay increases, bonuses, and 
      promotions.

      <p>By the same token, appraisal results are used to identify the poorer 
      performers who may require some form of counseling, or in extreme cases, 
      demotion, dismissal or decreases in pay. (Organizations need to be aware 
      of laws in their country that might restrict their capacity to dismiss 
      employees or decrease pay.)

      <p>Whether this is an appropriate use of performance appraisal - the 
      assignment and justification of rewards and penalties - is a very 
      uncertain and contentious matter.

       <h>Controversy, Controversy
      <p>Few issues in management stir up more controversy than performance 
      appraisal.

      <p>There are many reputable sources - researchers, management commentators, 
      psychometricians - who have expressed doubts about the validity and 
      reliability of the performance appraisal process. Some have even suggested 
      that the process is so inherently flawed that it may be impossible to 
      perfect it (see Derven, 1990, for example).

      <p>At the other extreme, there are many strong advocates of performance 
      appraisal. Some view it as potentially "... the most crucial aspect of 
      organizational life" (Lawrie, 1990).
      <p>Between these two extremes lie various schools of belief. While all 
      endorse the use of performance appraisal, there are many different 
      opinions on how and when to apply it. 

      <p>There are those, for instance, who believe that performance appraisal has 
      many important employee development uses, but scorn any attempt to link 
      the process to reward outcomes - such as pay rises and promotions.

      <p>This group believes that the linkage to reward outcomes reduces or 
      eliminates the developmental value of appraisals. Rather than an 
      opportunity for constructive review and encouragement, the reward-linked 
      process is perceived as judgmental, punitive and harrowing.

      <p>For example, how many people would gladly admit their work problems if, at 
      the same time, they knew that their next pay rise or a much-wanted 
      promotion was riding on an appraisal result? Very likely, in that 
      situation, many people would deny or downplay their weaknesses.

      <p>Nor is the desire to distort or deny the truth confined to the person 
      being appraised. Many appraisers feel uncomfortable with the combined role 
      of judge and executioner.
      <p>Such reluctance is not difficult to understand. Appraisers often know 
      their appraisees well, and are typically in a direct 
      subordinate-supervisor relationship. They work together on a daily basis 
      and may, at times, mix socially. Suggesting that a subordinate needs to 
      brush up on certain work skills is one thing; giving an appraisal result 
      that has the direct effect of negating a promotion is another.
      <p>The result can be resentment and serious morale damage, leading to 
      workplace disruption, soured relationships and productivity declines.
      <p>On the other hand, there is a strong rival argument which claims that 
      performance appraisal must unequivocally be linked to reward outcomes.
      <p>The advocates of this approach say that organizations must have a process 
      by which rewards - which are not an unlimited resource - may be openly and 
      fairly distributed to those most deserving on the basis of merit, effort 
      and results.
      <p>There is a critical need for remunerative justice in organizations. 
      Performance appraisal - whatever its practical flaws - is the only process 
      available to help achieve fair, decent and consistent reward outcomes.
      <p>It has also been claimed that appraisees themselves are inclined to 
      believe that appraisal results should be linked directly to reward 
      outcomes - and are suspicious and disappointed when told this is not the 
      case. Rather than feeling relieved, appraisees may suspect that they are 
      not being told the whole truth, or that the appraisal process is a sham 
      and waste of time. 

       <h>The Link to Rewards
      <p>Recent research (Bannister & Balkin, 1990) has reported that appraisees 
      seem to have greater acceptance of the appraisal process, and feel more 
      satisfied with it, when the process is directly linked to rewards. Such 
      findings are a serious challenge to those who feel that appraisal results 
      and reward outcomes must be strictly isolated from each other.
      <p>There is also a group who argues that the evaluation of employees for 
      reward purposes, and frank communication with them about their 
      performance, are part of the basic responsibilities of management. The 
      practice of not discussing reward issues while appraising performance is, 
      say critics, based on inconsistent and muddled ideas of motivation.
      <p>In many organizations, this inconsistency is aggravated by the practice of 
      having separate wage and salary reviews, in which merit rises and bonuses 
      are decided arbitrarily, and often secretly, by supervisors and managers.
