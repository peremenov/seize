                  <h>Description: 
                  <p>The effective business, Peter Drucker observes, focuses on 
                  opportunities rather than problems. How this focus is achieved 
                  in order to make the organization prosper and grow is the 
                  subject of this companion to his classic, The Practice of 
                  Management. The earlier book was chiefly concerned with how 
                  management functions; this volume shows what the executive 
                  decision-maker must do to move his enterprise forward. 
                  <p>One of the notable accomplishments of this book is its 
                  combining specific economic analysis with a grasp of the 
                  entrepreneurial force in business prosperity. For though it 
                  discusses "what to do" more than Drucker's previous works, the 
                  book stresses the qualitative aspect of enterprise: every 
                  successful business requires a goal and spirit all its own. 
                  Peter Drucker again employs his particular genius for breaking 
                  through conventional outlooks and opening up new 
                  perspectives--for profits and growth. 
                  <h>Excerpt:
                  <h>Business Realities
                  <p>That executives give neither sufficient time nor sufficient 
                  thought to the future is a universal complaint. Every 
                  executive voices it when he talks about his own working day 
                  and when he talks or writes to his associates. It is a 
                  recurrent theme in the articles and in the books on 
management.
                  <p>It is a valid complaint. Executives should spend more time and 
                  thought on the future of their business. They also should 
                  spend more time and thought on a good many other things, their 
                  social and community responsibilities for instance. Both they 
                  and their businesses pay a stiff penalty for these neglects. 
                  And yet, to complain that executives spend so little time on 
                  the work of tomorrow is futile. The neglect of the future is 
                  only a symptom; the executive slights tomorrow because he 
                  cannot get ahead of today. That too is a symptom. The real 
                  disease is the absence of any foundation of knowledge and 
                  system for tackling the economic tasks in business.
                  <p>Today's job takes all the executive's time, as a rule; yet it 
                  is seldom done well. Few managers are greatly impressed with 
                  their own performance in the immediate tasks. They feel 
                  themselves caught in a "rat race," and managed by whatever the 
                  mailboy dumps into their "in" tray. They know that crash 
                  programs which attempt to "solve" this or that particular 
                  "urgent" problem rarely achieve right and lasting results. And 
                  yet, they rush from one crash program to the next. Worse 
                  still, they known that the same problems recur again and 
                  again, no matter how many times they are "solved."
                  <p>Before an executive can think of tackling the future, he must 
                  be able therefore to dispose of the challenges of today in 
                  less time and with greater impact and permanence. For this he 
                  needs a systematic approach to today's job.
                  <p>There are three different dimensions to the economic task: 
                  (1)The present business must be made effective; (2) its 
                  potential must be identified and realized; (3) it must be made 
                  into a different business for a different future. Each task 
                  requires a distinct approach. Each asks different questions. 
                  Each comes out with different conclusions. Yet they are 
                  inseparable. All three have to be done at the same time: 
                  today. All three have to be carried out with the same 
                  organization, the same resources of men, knowledge, and money, 
                  and in the same entrepreneurial process. The future is not 
                  going to be made tomorrow; it is being made today, and largely 
                  by the decisions and actions taken with respect to the tasks 
                  of today. Conversely, what is being done to bring about the 
                  future directly affects the present. The tasks overlap. They 
                  require one unified strategy. Otherwise, they cannot really 
                  get done at all.
                  <p>To tackle any one of these jobs, let alone all three together, 
                  requires an understanding of the true realities of the 
                  business as an economic system, of its capacity for economic 
                  performance, and of the relationship between available 
                  resources and possible results. Otherwise, there is no 
                  alternative to the "rat race." This understanding never comes 
                  ready-made; it has to be developed separately for each 
                  business. Yet the assumptions and expectations that underlie 
                  it are largely common. Businesses are different, but business 
                  is much the same, regardless of size and structure, of 
                  products, technology and markets, of culture and managerial 
                  competence. There is a common business reality.
                  <p>There are actually two sets of generalizations that apply to 
                  most businesses most of the time: one with respect to the 
                  results and resources of a business, one with respect to its 
                  efforts. Together they lead to a number of conclusions 
                  regarding the nature and direction of the entrepreneurial job.
                  <p>Most of these assumptions will sound plausible, perhaps even 
                  familiar , to most businessmen, but few businessmen ever pun 
                  them together into a coherent whole. Few draw action 
                  conclusions from them, no matter how much each individual 
                  statement agrees with their experience and knowledge. As a 
                  result, few executives base their actions on these, their own 
                  assumptions and expectations.
                  <p>1. Neither results nor resources exist inside the business. 
                  Both exist outside. There are no profit centers within the 
                  business; there are only cost centers. The only thing one can 
                  say with certainty about any business activity, whether 
                  engineering or selling, manufacturing or accounting, is that 
                  it consumes efforts and thereby incurs costs. Whether it 
                  contributes to results remains to be seen.
                  <p>Results depend not on anybody within the business nor on 
                  anything within the control of the business. They depend on 
                  somebody outside--the customer in a market economy, the 
                  political authorities in a controlled economy. It is always 
                  somebody outside who decides whether the efforts of a business 
                  become economic results or whether they become so much waste 
                  and scrap.
                  <p>The same is true of the one and only distinct resource of any 
                  business: knowledge. Other resources, money or physical 
                  equipment, for instance, do not confer any distinction. What 
                  does make a business distinct and what is its peculiar 
                  resource is its ability to use knowledge of all kinds--from 
                  scientific and technical knowledge to social, economic, and 
                  managerial knowledge. It is only in respect to knowledge that 
                  a business can be distinct, can therefore produce something 
                  that has a value in the market place.
                  <p>Yet knowledge is not a business resource. It is a universal 
                  social resource. It cannot be kept a secret for any length of 
                  time. "What one man has done, another man can always do again" 
                  is old and profound wisdom. The one decisive resource of 
                  business, therefore, is as much outside of the business as are 
                  business results.
                  <p>Indeed, business can be defined as a process that converts an 
                  outside resource, namely knowledge, into outside results, 
                  namely economic values.
                  <p>2. Results are obtained by exploiting opportunities, not by 
                  solving problems. All one can hope to get by solving a problem 
                  is to restore normality. All one can hope, at best, is to 
                  eliminate a restriction on the capacity of the business to 
                  obtain results. The results themselves must come from the 
                  exploitation of opportunities.
