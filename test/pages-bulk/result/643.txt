      <p>apping into the unique skills of knowledge workers requires leaders to 
      adopt new ways of thinking and to apply new models of organization to the 
      workplace. According to Harvard business professor Rosabeth Moss Kanter in 
      Executive Excellence, "Your structures should be very loose and very 
      flexible: less hierarchy, more opportunity for people to play many 
      different roles. Sometimes you may be a team leader, and at other times 
      you may be a team member. Also, be very flexible with respect to titles, 
      and very fluid in terms of moving people from project to project, 
      depending on the requirements. And be very project oriented, rather than 
      fixed-job oriented."
      <p>Knowledge workers are not limited to the world of high-tech, New Economy 
      business. They are found in every industry and every business and, as 
      Peter Drucker has pointed out, in some surprising places -- including 
      symphony orchestras. And one orchestra in particular -- New York 
      City-based Orpheus Chamber Orchestra -- has become a model for Kanter's 
      new kind of loose and flexible organization. 

      <h>Orpheus Chamber Orchestra
      <p>rpheus Chamber Orchestra is an orchestra with a difference: it has no 
      conductor. The group was founded in 1972 by cellist Julian Fifer and a 
      small group of like-minded musicians with the goal of bringing the chamber 
      music ideals of democracy, personal involvement, and mutual respect into 
      an orchestral setting. In an interview with Ron Lieber in Fast Company 
      (May 2000, p. 286), Fifer stated, "I loved chamber music's clarity of 
      sound and flexibility of temperament. I wanted to bring that camaraderie 
      and spirit into a larger setting. And in order for everyone to be able to 
      communicate more effectively, it seemed necessary to do without a 
      conductor." Orpheus, widely considered to be one of the world's great 
      orchestras, comprises 27 permanent members -- employees who cannot be 
      fired -- and a number of substitute players who fill in where necessary, 
      as well as a board of trustees and administrative management.
      <p>In most orchestras, the conductor directly supervises each musician; the 
      conductor not only decides what music will be played but how it will be 
      played as well. There is little room for the opinions or suggestions of 
      the musicians themselves; such input is rarely solicited and even less 
      often welcomed. Like workers reporting to an autocratic manager, 
      orchestral musicians are expected to unquestioningly follow the direction 
      of the conductor -- anything less invites humiliation before one's 
      colleagues and may be grounds for immediate dismissal.
      <p>As a result, orchestral musicians are a notoriously unhappy class of 
      employees. Paul Judy reports that when Harvard Business School professor 
      J. Richard Hackman studied job attitudes among people working in 13 
      different job groups, he discovered that symphony orchestra musicians 
      ranked below prison guards in job satisfaction. Further, when asked about 
      their satisfaction with opportunities for career growth, symphony 
      orchestra musicians fared even worse, ranking 9th out of the 13 surveyed 
      job categories. Clearly, although the results of an orchestral performance 
      can be exceptionally uplifting, the means of attaining these results are 
      often anything but uplifting to those whose job it is to achieve them.
      <p>In place of the traditional fixed leadership position of conductor, 
      Orpheus has developed a unique system of collaborative leadership that 
      invites every member of the orchestra to participate in leadership 
      positions, either leading the group in rehearsal and performance as 
      concertmaster, or by leading one of the orchestra's many different formal 
      or informal teams. This system is extremely flexible -- musicians freely 
      move in and out of positions of leadership -- and it can be used to 
      quickly adapt to changing conditions in the marketplace or within the 
      group itself.
      <p>This free flow of leadership positions within the group encourages all the 
      members of the orchestra to give their personal best performance. Cellist 
      Eric Bartlett says, "When there's an important concert, everybody feels 
      it, and everybody goes into it doing their absolute best work, giving it 
      their utmost concentration, playing off of each other, and making sparks 
      fly. For the most part, in a conducted orchestra, you play a more passive 
      role. Not only is less expected of you, but less is expected from you. You 
      have to play extremely well, but you're not playing off of your colleagues 
      -- you're playing off of that one person in front of the orchestra holding 
      the baton. I don't see that people in regular orchestras are emotionally 
      involved in the same way. Everybody plays well, they do a very good job, 
      but the level of individual emotional involvement isn't there."
      <p>With no conductor to act as a filter to the what and the why behind the 
      group's decisions, the members of Orpheus are uncommonly energized and 
      responsive to the needs of the organization and to the desires of its 
      leaders. Turnover is extremely low and employee loyalty is extremely high. 
      The result is a better product, increased customer satisfaction, and a 
      healthier bottom line. 

      <h>Principles of Orpheus Leadership
      <p>rpheus Chamber Orchestra has labeled its system of collaborative 
      leadership the "Orpheus Process." While the process is not without its 
      difficulties -- getting 27 talented and strong-willed people to agree to 
      anything can often be a very real challenge -- it has served the group 
      well over the past three decades and it continues to evolve to meet the 
      needs of the orchestra and its customers: the listening public. This 
      process, detailed in the accompanying sidebar, is built on a foundation of 
      eight principles:
      <h>1. Put power in the hands of the people doing the work.
      <p>In recent years, company leaders have heard a common refrain: 
      organizations that empower their workers with true authority and 
      responsibility can expect better products and services, more satisfied 
      customers, and increased revenue and profits. Unfortunately, the reality 
      of the situation is that many managers have been slow to give up power, in 
      many cases withholding it altogether. According to a Gallup poll of 1,200 
      U.S. workers, while 66 percent of respondents reported that their managers 
      asked them to get involved in decision making within their organizations, 
      only 14 percent of these same workers reported that they felt they had 
      actually been given real authority.
      <p>According to double-bass player Don Palma, a member since the group's 
      founding in 1972, the difference between working in Orpheus and working in 
      a traditional orchestra is dramatic. Says Palma, "I took one year off from 
      Orpheus at the very beginning and went to the Los Angeles Philharmonic. I 
      just hated it. I didn't like to be told what to do all the time, being 
      treated like I wasn't really worth anything other than to be a good 
      soldier and just sit there and do as I was told. I felt powerless to 
      affect things, particularly when they were not going well. I felt 
      frustrated, and there was nothing I could seem to do to help make things 
      better. Orpheus keeps me involved. I have some measure of participation in 
      the direction the music is going to take. I think that's why a lot of us 
      have stayed involved for so long."
      <p>Unlike most orchestras, whose conductors wield full and unquestioned 
      authority over the musicians playing under their baton, Orpheus musicians 
      decide for themselves who will lead the group, how a piece of music will 
      be played, who will be invited to join their ranks, and who will represent 
      them on the board of trustees and within management. The group's 
      administrators do not impose their vision on the musicians, and 
      disagreements that cannot be resolved through Orpheus's regular process of 
      discussion and consensus-building are ultimately settled by a vote of all 
      of the members of the orchestra.
      <h>2. Encourage individual responsibility for product and quality.
      <p>Because Orpheus has no conductor and therefore no single person to take 
      responsibility for the quality of its performances, each member of the 
      orchestra feels a very real and personal responsibility for the group's 
      outcomes. Orpheus gives every individual the opportunity to lead, but it 
      also creates an imperative that everyone pull together. Instead of 
      focusing solely on perfecting their own approach to performance, each 
      musician takes a personal interest in perfecting the performances of their 
      colleagues and the overall sound of the orchestra. It is therefore not 
      uncommon for a violinist to comment on the playing of a flutist, or the 
      timpani player to comment on a cellist's approach to phrasing or bowing. 
      In a regular, conducted orchestra, not only would such crossing of 
      organizational lines be unwelcome, it would be unthinkable.
      <h>3. Create clarity of roles.
      <p>While leadership within Orpheus is not fixed with any one particular 
      person or position, the organization's members have clear roles in 
      addition to their jobs as musicians, administrators, or members of the 
      board of trustees. For each piece of music, for example, the musicians 
      elect one person to serve as concertmaster, the person appointed to lead 
      the group in rehearsal and performance. Some members of the orchestra 
      serve on the board, others represent the musicians within the group's 
      administration, and still others participate in formal and informal teams. 
      All roles are communicated widely throughout the organization.



      <h>4. Foster horizontal teamwork.
      <p>Says Peter Drucker, "No knowledge ranks higher than another; each is 
      judged by its contribution to the common task rather than by any inherent 
      superiority or inferiority. Therefore, the modern organization cannot be 
      an organization of boss and subordinate. It must be organized as a team."
      <p>Because no one person has all the answers to every question that may arise 
      within the orchestra, Orpheus relies on horizontal teams -- both formal 
      and informal -- to tap the expertise of all of its members. These teams 
      are horizontal because members are not artificially limited to focusing 
      their attention on only very narrow issues or opportunities; members of 
      teams within Orpheus naturally reach across organizational boundaries to 
      obtain input, act on opportunities, solve problems, or make decisions. 
      Says violinist Martha Caplin, "We're all specialists, that's the beginning 
      of the discussion. When I talk to another performer or another musician in 
      the group, it's on an equal level. It's absolutely crucial that we all 
      have that attitude."
            Not every team is an effective team.
      <p>Leaders should be aware that not every team is an effective team, and they 
      must work to ensure that the members of teams take positive steps to 
      ensure their own effectiveness. John Lubans, deputy university librarian 
      at Duke University, has studied Orpheus's workings, and in a report 
      published in the Duke University Libraries Information Bulletin in 1997, 
      he cites a variety of reasons for why teamwork is effective within the 
      group. He notes that the purpose and mission for the team are clear and 
      understood by each team member; members' team roles are stated, agreed 
      upon, and understood; all members work an equal amount doing real work in 
      the team; members pay attention to how they work together; outcomes drive 
      the purpose of the team; deadlines are stated and respected; teams receive 
      demonstrable support; teams are accountable to the organization and its 
      leaders; and each team knows its interdependence with other teams and does 
      everything to support those other teams. These rules are valid for any 
      team, not just those within Orpheus.
      <h>5. Share and rotate leadership
      <p>In most organizations leadership is fixed, that is, leadership authority 
      is formally vested in certain positions and not in others. Managers are by 
      definition leaders and workers are expected to be followers. The higher up 
      the organization chart an individual's position resides, the more power he 
      or she wields. Fixing leadership in positions rather than in people wastes 
      the leadership potential within employees whose positions are not a part 
      of the organization's formal leadership hierarchy. This potential is often 
      ignored or discarded, and occasionally punished.
      <p>Sharing and rotating leadership among all the orchestra's musicians is the 
      heart and soul of the Orpheus Process. While most orchestras fix 
      leadership authority within one particular position, the conductor, 
      Orpheus takes a different approach. Whenever the orchestra decides to take 
      on a new piece of music, the group appoints one of its members to lead the 
      development of the piece. The leader is selected on the basis of what 
      skills and knowledge he or she brings to the piece -- someone who is 
      expert in baroque music will be selected to lead a Handel selection, 
      someone who is particularly knowledgeable about twentieth century 
      composers will take on a Stravinsky piece. In this way, leadership is 
      shared and rotated among the different members of the group, and the 
      strengths of individual members of the group are brought to the fore.
      <h>6. Learn to listen, learn to talk.
      <p>The members of Orpheus know the power of communication, and it is the 
      lifeblood of the organization. Not only are members expected to listen to 
      one another's views and opinions, and to respect what is said and the 
      person who said it -- whether or not they agree with what is being said -- 
      members are also expected to talk. But there is a right time and a wrong 
      time to talk. According to Orpheus violinist Eriko Sato, "Fundamentally, I 
      don't think everybody's opinion should be addressed at all times. There 
      are certain places and times for certain things to be said -- the 
      appropriate moment. Everybody knows what's wrong, everybody can feel 
      what's wrong -- but do you have a solution? Do you know how to solve a 
      problem?"
      <p>No topic is considered out of bounds for the members of the group, and 
      constructive criticism is always welcome. This freedom of expression is 
      surprising when one realizes that orchestral musicians are trained from an 
      early age specifically not to offer their opinions to the group and 
      instead to defer to the direction of the conductor. Few conductors welcome 
      the suggestions of the musicians working under their baton, most actively 
      discourage them. In Orpheus, two-way communication is expected, fostered, 
      and reinforced almost constantly.
      <h>7. Seek consensus (and build creative systems that favor consensus).
      <p>As an increasing number and variety of employees become involved in their 
      organizations' decision-making processes, and as organizations become less 
      autocratic and more democratic, achieving consensus on decisions becomes 
      more important. Consensus, which derives from the Latin word for "shared 
      thought," requires a high level of participation and trust among the 
      members of an organization. Employees must be willing to listen to the 
      views of others and to be flexible and willing to compromise on their own 
      positions.
      <p>Traditionally, as the importance of a decision increases, the number of 
      people involved in it decreases in direct proportion. An organization's 
      most important decisions are most often made by its top management team, 
      usually without input from line workers. This is most certainly not the 
      case in Orpheus Chamber Orchestra. In Orpheus, the more important the 
      decision to the organization, the more people are involved in it. But 
      involving more people in the process doesn't dilute the final result, it 
      strengthens it. Violinist Ronnie Bauch is quoted in Christopher Hoenig's 
      The Problem Solving Journey saying, "What you get isn't a watered-down, 
      middle-of-the-road kind of interpretation which you could easily imagine 
      -- you know, General Motors decides to interpret music -- but you get 
      interpretations of extraordinary originality."
      <p>In an organization such as Orpheus where positional power is minimal, and 
      where leadership is not fixed, the ability of leaders to build consensus 
      and to convince others to support their opinions is paramount. Without 
      consensus, little can be accomplished in the organization.
      <h>8. Dedicate passionately to your mission.
      <p>Passion is the spark that can make an ordinary organization great -- and a 
      great organization truly exceptional. When employees are passionate about 
      the jobs they do, the organizations they work for, and the customers they 
      serve, there is little that they cannot accomplish.
      <p>This passion, however, sometimes boils over, causing more than a few 
      arguments and heated exchanges. According to violist Nardo Poy in The 
      Problem Solving Journey, "There are times in rehearsal, because of the way 
      we work, the intensity, the directness, often we do get pretty emotional, 
      angry at each other. And yet, when our rehearsal is over, that's pretty 
      much it, for the most part it's over. Either right after rehearsal or the 
      next day, you're still friends." Because musicians in Orpheus feel free to 
      express themselves with one another, resentments and feuds rarely have an 
      opportunity to develop. This results in an environment where all the 
      members of the organization are focused on one thing: producing the very 
      best product possible.
      <p>A measure of the passion that Orpheus's members feel for their 
      organization is the fact that although the majority of them also play for 
      other groups, including the New York Philharmonic and the Metropolitan 
      Opera, and teach at schools such as Juilliard and the Manhattan School of 
      Music, they consider playing for Orpheus to be their most fulfilling 
      musical experience.
      <p>By removing the position of conductor from the organization, New York 
      City-based Orpheus Chamber Orchestra has unleashed an incredible amount of 
      leadership from its members. While the organization and its structures 
      keep evolving, this Grammy-award-winning group continues to perform at the 
      top of its game -- a level of excellence that few other orchestras can 
      approach. And, as long as Orpheus relies on its own members to guide and 
      energize the group, it's likely that this will be the case for many years 
      to come.
      <p>Quotations from musicians come from Leadership Ensemble, by Harvey Seifter 
      and Peter Economy (Henry Holt & Company, 2001), except where otherwise 
      noted. 

            <h>The Orpheus Process
            <p>The Orpheus Process translates the communal creativity of a small, 
            four-piece chamber music group -- where each musician has an equal 
            voice in determining how a piece of music will be played -- into the 
            much larger and more complex setting of an orchestra. The Orpheus 
            Process comprises five key elements: 
              <p>Choosing Leaders. For each piece of music Orpheus performs, a 
              committee of musicians chosen by orchestra members selects a 
              concertmaster, the first-chair violinist. The orchestra's members 
              also select a leadership team of five to seven players, called the 
              core. In Orpheus, the concertmaster anchors the core, leads 
              performances, and works closely with all the musicians to develop 
              a unified vision for the music. Each instrumental section (cello, 
              oboe, and so on) selects individuals to represent it within the 
              core.
              <p>Developing Strategies. Before a piece of music is taken to the 
              full orchestra, the core meets to decide how it will be played. 
              The goal: developing an overall interpretive approach to the 
              music. The core accomplishes this goal through rehearsals where 
              many different approaches can be tried in a streamlined fashion.
              <p>Developing the Product. After the core is satisfied with its 
              chosen approach to the piece, it is taken to the full orchestra to 
              be rehearsed and refined even further. Musicians from throughout 
              the orchestra make suggestions to improve the piece and critique 
              the playing of their colleagues. When disagreements arise, as they 
              do in any organization, the orchestra members work to reach 
              consensus. If consensus cannot be reached within a reasonable 
              period of time, then a vote is taken and the issue is settled.
              <p>Perfecting the Product. Immediately before every concert, one or 
              two members of the orchestra are selected to go out into the hall 
              and listen to the group as the audience will hear it. These 
              musicians report back to the entire group and suggest final 
              adjustments and refinements based on the actual sound of the full 
              orchestra.
              <p>Delivering the Product. The final step is performance, the 
              ultimate result of the Orpheus Process. The Orpheus Process does 
              not end here, however. After every concert, participants 
              informally discuss their impressions of the performance and make 
              suggestions for further adjustments and refinements -- all with an 
              eye to improving subsequent performances of the piece.
