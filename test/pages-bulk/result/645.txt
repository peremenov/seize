                              <h>2002 Canadian GP: Car-by-Car
                              10/06/2002
                              <h>Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro
                              Has revised aerodynamic package for this circuit
                              <h>1. Michael Schumacher
                              <p>Sunday: Fastest in warm-up but also suffered 
                              engine failure in spare car. Beaten into third 
                              place off the grid, moving up to second when 
                              Montoya stopped under the safety car. Inherited 
                              lead when leading teammate stopped on lap 26, now 
                              with 12s lead. Pitted and stopped for 11.4s on lap 
                              38, dropped to second place and pushed by 
                              Raikkonen, retook lead when Montoya stopped on lap 
                              51. Lead grew to 21s when Montoya retired on lap 
                              57, but then eased up so victory by 1.1s. 1st 
                              <p>Saturday: Fastest in both morning sessions. Engine 
                              very good in qualifying. Disappointed not to be 
                              able to fight for pole. Lost time on third run, 
                              his fastest. Didn't extract full potential from 
                              car. 2nd/1m 13.018s
                              <p>Friday: Glanced wall on outside of final chicane 
                              with right hand rear wheel towards end of morning 
                              session and pitted with broken wheel rim. Ran 
                              three sets of tyres as he worked on race set-up, 
                              determined not to leave anything for chance after 
                              last year's problems. 3rd/1m 15.788s
                              <h>2. Rubens Barrichello
                              <p>Sunday: No major problems in warm-up. Good start, 
                              running two stop strategy and up to second place, 
                              then overtaking Montoya to lead lap one when 
                              Montoya runs wide. Opened up 4.3s when safety car 
                              came out. Then opened up gap to teammate, to 5.0s 
                              before pitting for 10.6s, longish to clean out 
                              side pods. Rejoined sixth, just behind Coulthard, 
                              but then dropped back. Moved up to third again 
                              with pit stops, but then stopped again on lap 54 
                              in 5.8s, dropping to fourth, just behind 
                              Coulthard. Tried to overtake Coulthard on lap 61 
                              when Coulthard delayed by slower car but ran over 
                              kerb in final chicane and then settled on third to 
                              the flag. 3rd 
                              <p>Saturday: Went off onto grass at turns eight/nine 
                              and on regaining track, locked up brakes and 
                              slammed into wall, damaging right hand front 
                              wheel. Hit kerb and spun at turn three/four on 
                              third run in qualifying. Admitted playing catch-up 
                              for most of the day. 4th/1m 13.301s
                              <p>Friday: Fastest in morning session, then short cut 
                              chicane in afternoon session and suffered brake 
                              problems. Finds car well balanced. Need to find 
                              right settings now. 8th/1m 16.440s
                              <h>West McLaren Mercedes
                              <p>Slightly upgraded Mercedes V109 engine to be used 
                              on Saturday
                              <h>3. David Coulthard
                              <p>Sunday: Routine warm-up although two off-track 
                              excursions. Moved up two places to sixth at the 
                              start, pushed by Heidfeld and Fisichella after 
                              safety car period, but then pulling away again, 
                              but struggling with oversteer. Pushed by 
                              Barrichello after the Ferrari driver's pit stop, 
                              but again pulled away. Made only pit stop on lap 
                              49 in 9.2s, rejoining fourth which became third 
                              with Barrichello's second stop and second with 
                              Montoya's retirement. Nearly overtaken by 
                              Barrichello when delayed by Sato on lap 62, but 
                              pulled away. 2nd 
                              <p>Saturday: Had a spin at turn eight in first part 
                              of morning session but rejoined. Had spin at the 
                              end of the session at the final corner in 
                              qualifying but able to rejoin. Felt qualifying 
                              'horrible.' Hit traffic on first run and lost 
                              time. Second run affected by yellow flags due to 
                              Sato incident. Felt third row possible. 8th/1m 
                              14.385s
                              <p>Friday: Had two brief offs in morning session. 
                              Problems trying various software options which did 
                              not quite work. Worked on race trim. Evaluated 
                              tyres, and tried to find the right balance. Still 
                              work to be done and can get more out of package. 
                              Finds grip level has improved. 1st/1m 15.407s
