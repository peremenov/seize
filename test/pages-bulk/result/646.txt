      What's Your Reason for Relay?

      <p>Each one of us has our own personal reasons to Relay, whether it be a 
      family member, friend or even ourselves who has been diagnosed with 
      Cancer. But we all Relay toward the same outcome. Hope drives us all, and 
      we derive our inspiration from the stories and faith of others. "Because 
      of YOU... lives are saved, lives are changed." The reason why I Relay is 
      to preserve the memory of my Uncle Wallace Campbell, to honor my mother, 
      Myrtle Pake, for her battle and survival of breast cancer and my father, 
      Dennis Pake, who has had melanoma. I also Relay for you so that hopefully 
      you will not ever hear those terrible words “You have cancer”. I Relay to 
      raise funds for research, advocacy and patient support programs. I love 
      fighting for a cure for cancer, bringing hope. 
      <p>The American Cancer Society is at work in communities all across the 
      country providing programs aimed at reducing the risk of cancer, detecting 
      cancer as early as possible, ensuring proper treatment, and empowering 
      people facing cancer to cope and maintain the highest possible quality of 
      life. I am extremely passionate about Relay and seeing this fight to the 
      end. I joined the staff of the American Cancer Society in December 2004 
      and will happily lose the job of my dreams because of the ultimate goal: 
      finding a cure for cancer. With God as our main supporter and each one of 
      us, one day soon the dreaded “C” word “Cancer” will be just another word 
      in our history books. 

      <p>We all have our stories. What is yours? 
      Charlotte King, American Cancer Society

      <p>I’m often asked why I am so passionate about the Relay for Life.  People 
      wonder, is it because I’ve had cancer myself or that I’ve lost a loved one 
      to the awful disease?  I Relay because I know it could be me someday.  We 
      are all surrounded by cancer every day.  We can’t get away from it.  I 
      lost a cousin this past week to lung cancer.  He was 45 years old and a 
      single dad.  The wife of one of my co-workers was diagnosed a month ago 
      with colon cancer.  She is 35 years old and has two small children.  These 
      aren’t bad people.  They haven’t abused their bodies.  They’re people just 
      like me.  I am thankful every day that I have the health and strength to 
      do something to help find a cure.  I’m grateful that I live in a community 
      where people care and are willing to spend some of their precious free 
      time volunteering to raise money and raise awareness.

      <p>On August 11, 1997, I experienced the worst day of my life (or so I 
      thought). My 7 year old son Christopher was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin's 
      Lymphoma. I always thought this was something that happened to other 
      people. I couldn't believe this was happening to "MY" child. I found out 
      then, and many times since, that it can happen to anyone. As it turns out, 
      May 10, 2001 was the worst day of my life. After a 4 year courageous 
      battle, my "baby" lost his battle with that dreaded disease.
      <p>With Christopher as my inspiration, I "Relay" so that some day, other 
      children and their parents do not have to experience the horrible disease 
      of cancer and what it does to you physically and emotionally. I don't want 
      any child to have to go through what my son went through and I don't want 
      any parent to have to experience the loss of a child.
      <p>For me, participating in the Relay for Life helps to make something 
      positive out of something so very negative. I am confident some day there 
      will be a cure for cancer, and I will have the satisfaction of knowing 
      that I played a very small part in it.
      <p>Claire Wilson, Committee Co-Chair

      <p>I spent my 26th birthday (October) in Asheville with my dad and his new 
      wife.  It was then that my dad decided to tell me something that would 
      forever change my life.  He had always complained of gall stones, so 
      decided it was time to have them removed.  He'd had his surgery the week 
      before.  Come to find out it wasn't gall stones he had been complaining of 
      for the last 15 years, it was intestinal cancer.  The doctors did an 
      open/close procedure for a biopsy to determine what all was involved.  
      EVERYTHING...the cancer was touching almost every part of him.  For the 
      next 6 weeks, I would travel from Raleigh to Asheville every Friday 
      through Sunday and spend every precious moment with my father.  We came to 
      understand each other and express our love, support, faith and being so 
      proud of each other.  With God beside him during the night, my father 
      passed away December 4, 1993.  Only 6 weeks after they diagnosed him with 
      cancer.  We had just celebrated his 56th birthday the night before, with 
      each of his three children there. 
      <p>My dad wasn't alive for some of the most important parts of my life..he 
      never met my husband, nor was he there for my wedding or the birth of my 
      daughter.  I do believe that he WAS with me through it all.  I feel that I 
      am giving something back to my father by doing the Relay.  It makes me 
      feel worth while and I know that he would be so proud.

      <p>In the fall of 1979, a man was told he had a tumor.  A tumor, not cancer!  
      On January 12, 1980 this man died.  He was my Grandpa.  In late August 
      1990, a lady was told she had a tumor.  A tumor, not cancer!  On September 
      18, 1990 she died.  She was my Grannie.  On December 21, 1998, a man was 
      told he had a mass on his throat.  A mass, not cancer!  On December 25, 
      1999, this man died.  This man was my dearest and best friend’s husband.  
      In early 2000, a man was told he had a mass in his lungs.  A mass, not 
      cancer!  On March 10, 2001, this man died.  This man was my Uncle.   
      <p>On December 2, 1989, a baby boy was born.  A happy, healthy nine pounder.  
      He was such an active little boy.  He loved to work on things and figure 
      them out.  He loved keys and loved to open things up and see what was 
      inside. He loved his #1 baby.  A soft, stuffed little green and white 
      rabbit.  He loved his family and his baby sister.  That baby boy turned 
      into a little man and on August 11, 1997, which happened to be his 
      grandmother’s birthday, he  was treated for strep throat and enlarged 
      lymph nodes.  Strep throat, not cancer!  He was seven and a half years 
      old.  And on May 10, 2001, this little boy died from this dreaded disease 
      called cancer!!  This brave and courageous little boy was my great-nephew. 
      This should not have happened.  This should not happen to any child or 
      adult. 
      <p>Many other friends and family members have been diagnosed with cancer 
      during this time period, some are survivors and others have lost their 
      battle with cancer.  It is time to come together and do whatever it takes 
      to find a cure for this thing called CANCER!!  Why do I relay?  I hope 
      that my small part will help to save the lives of the rest of my family 
      and the many, many friends that I have.  GOD BLESS EVERYONE WHO RELAYS!!!
      <p>Wandra Farrell, Relay Committee

      <p>I don’t know of anyone who has not been affected by cancer in some 
      way….whether it’s battling this horrible disease personally or watching a 
      loved one suffer.   In October 1980, after numerous tests, x-rays, and 
      finally exploratory surgery, my mother’s doctors discovered that she had 
      pancreatic cancer.  From the very beginning they gave us no hope and did 
      not even recommend treatment.  My family had never had anything to “rock 
      our world” as this did, and being in total denial we refused to accept her 
      fate.  An oncologist finally agreed to try chemotherapy but after only two 
      treatments, mother was too weak to go through anymore.  After suffering 
      for six months, she passed away April 17, 1981. To this day I haven’t 
      forgotten what she went through and the feeling of total helplessness my 
      family felt because there wasn’t a “cure” to save our mother.  Since that 
      time, we’ve lost a dear aunt and uncle to cancer and, although it was not 
      the cause of his death, my dad had prostate cancer when he passed away in 
      May 2001.  These are ALL Reasons for me to Relay, and whatever small part 
      I play in raising money for cancer research is a labor of love in memory 
      of these very special people.

      <p>In the spring of 1988, one of my best friends (the pretty blonde in our 
      attached homecoming dance picture) was diagnosed with cancer. For 3 years, 
      she battled this disease, but ultimately lost her battle during our senior 
      year in high school. During that time, I wasn't the friend I could have 
      been...I didn't really know quite what to do or what to say to show her 
      how much I cared. I wish we had Relay in my hometown back then - I know we 
      could have done so much to fight cancer, as well as show our support for 
      our friend. I love seeing families and friends at the Relay, often with 
      the survivors they are supporting - your hard work means so much to them, 
      and to all of us who want to find a cure. Thank you!

      <p>CANCER---this six letter word brings such fear and heartache to so many.  
      My first response as to "Why I Relay" is to say to find a cure!  Secondly, 
      I'm reminded of the moments in my life that have been touched by cancer 
      (my mother-in-law surviving breast cancer, my own scare with a suspicious 
      lump, and the death of two mothers this year in my son's 6th grade class). 
        

      <p>When I was asked last year to walk in the Pittsboro Relay for Life my 
      first thought raced to the death of a dear friend's son.   I don't even 
      live in Pittsboro and my immediate response was YES, sign me up.  The ache 
      in my heart I feel each time I see my friend eases somewhat when I see all 
      of the Relay teams working so hard to raise money for the American Cancer 
      Society.  Working together we are all making a difference----no matter how 
      big or how small the contribution.   

      <p>If you ever question why you do this or you become tired of asking for 
      donations or selling this and that...stop for a minute and think of what 
      others have lost and remind yourself that it could have been your mother, 
      your child, or your best friend who lost their battle.   All of the work 
      we do is for those who did not survive and for those who will!
       
      <p>Traci Nunn, Co-Captain 
      The Survivors

      <p>If you know me...you know I'm a talker.  My Grandmother, Alma Brown, was a 
      talker too - except she got the point across in a lot less time than it 
      takes me!  She was my best friend and soul mate.  She had seven kids, 12 
      grand-kids, and 11 great-grand-children!  Even though I was only one of 
      her 12 grand-kids...she had a unique way of making me feel I was her very 
      favorite. In fact, I even signed all my cards to her "From your favorite 
      Grand-daughter Kay."  You know it takes someone very special to make each 
      one of us feel so special. 

      <p>In January 2000 my Grandmother was diagnosed with renal cancer.  She died 
      one month to the day of her diagnosis, February 14, 2000 - Valentine's 
      Day.  She accepted what God had given her, but I had a much harder time 
      letting go.  I made a choice to try and do something to honor her 
      memory...I just couldn't let her slip away!  Cancer may have struck my 
      Grandmother physically, but it actually attacked our entire family - 
      leaving a hole where she used to be.  But the Lord is always good and 
      works in mysterious ways and I responded to a request for volunteers for 
      Pittsboro's first annual Relay for Life which was a HUGE success! 

      <p>Now I'd be lying to myself if I ended the story there...my primary reason 
      was to honor my own Grandmother, but there is so much more now.  Since 
      being involved with the Relay, I have realized the number of friends, 
      family, co-workers, etc., that have had their lives touched and destroyed 
      in some way by cancer...and I too have had my own scares more than once.  
      I only needed to see the bald head on ONE child to pull at my heart 
      strings, I only needed to hear the cry of ONE parent in sorrow so deep 
      that no-one - not anyone - could comfort, I only once needed to see the 
      tears of my parents at the news of a loss of a friend (and there have been 
      several) due to cancer.  And I have only ONCE had to feel the helplessness 
      of not being able to help someone I care about.  I Relay because I do 
      believe there is a cure and that we are so close to finding it...and I am 
      helping in some small way to find it!  I Relay because I refuse to let 
      this disease to take control and just sit back and watch!  I Relay because 
      I can....how could you not?

      3-14-1988 - 5-25-2003
      <p>The Pittsboro Relay for Life committee extends their sympathy to the 
      family of Joey Timmons who lost his battle with cancer on May 25, 2003, 
      just one week after he rode in the survivor lap at our 2nd annual event.

      <p>Why do I Relay? I have asked myself this several times. I guess that’s why 
      it has taken me to this, my third year involved in the Relay to put it 
      into words. I am lucky. My family has little to no cancer. I have never 
      lost a close relative to this horrible disease. So when I think about why 
      I Relay I think because I was meant to. It is my responsibility to support 
      my community, friends and family by giving back all that I can. I believe 
      that all things happen for a reason and God has allowed me to be involved 
      with the Relay for Life in order to show me cancer, its affects and allow 
      these to touch my life. So when I think about why I Relay it’s to serve my 
      friends and community, to continue the fight against this tragic disease 
      and to touch others lives as I my self have been touched. I can only hope 
      that my efforts compel another person to join this fight.

      <p>In 2003, I relayed with The Survivors just to do something to help. This 
      year, I wanted to make a bigger difference, so I decided to form a team of 
      my own. Then in November, I was given an even bigger reason. My mom was 
      diagnosed with breast cancer. I felt like the rug had been pulled out from 
      under me. But, I knew we had work to do and I had to be brave and have a 
      deeper faith than ever before. I thank the Lord everyday because the 
      cancer was removed and now she is going through radiation treatments. My 
      mom is a survivor! 
      <p>I am co-captain of Bells Angels, from Bells Baptist church. Our church has 
      been hit hard by cancer over the past few years. I felt that if any church 
      congregation had a reason to relay, it's us. So, together with Jennifer 
      Chambers, we put a team together. 
      <p>I just wanted to help....no matter how much we raise, I just want to help 
      fight this disease. There is a cure out there, we just have to keep 
      looking. To steal a quote from the late Jim Valvano, "Don't give up; don't 
      ever, ever give up." 
      <p>Gail Blackwood
      Bells Baptist Church Team Captain

      <p>I became involved in Relay because the profound effect that Cancer had on 
      my family. 

      <p>I had always thought of my Gramps as Superman. He was never sick, always 
      had energy, loved to Fish, play with his grandchildren, travel and teach 
      us life's lessons. When he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, I was 
      crushed. If cancer could strike this man who I thought was indestructible, 
      who next. Unfortunately, he lost his fight with cancer more than ten years 
      ago. We all miss him dearly. I Relay in his memory!

      <p>My Brother, George, was also struck with cancer several years ago. I had a 
      hard time dealing with his illness. I stayed away because I just didn't 
      know what to say or do or even how to act. I will never be able to forgive 
      myself for that because he needed his family during that time. He 
      recovered and is in full remission. I Relay in his Honor! 

      <p>Won't you join me in the Fight!
      <p>Julie Payne
      Synergistics Team Captain

     <p>My involvement in Relay For Life was initiated by a "cold call" from Carol 
      Esau in 2003 to form a team from our church. I had not been involved in 
      the first Relay For Life event, but had heard wonderful things about it. I 
      took the challenge, and it turned out to be one of the most meaningful 
      things I have done in my life. When cancer strikes someone you love there 
      is not much you can do but pray, and be supportive. I lost my grandfather 
      to colon cancer, my grandmother was a breast cancer survivor, my father is 
      a melanoma survivor, two cousins died of melanoma at ages 41 and 51, and I 
      have another cousin in her fight with breast cancer, and it does not stop 
      there. My best friend from college days has a 7 year old daughter who was 
      diagnosed at age 4 with liver cancer. She is in her third year after her 
      transplant and doing great!
      <p>At our church alone we have lost several wonderful church members to 
      cancer. We do have cancer survivors in our church and I Relay for them 
      with the hope that they will be with us for a long, long time. It makes me 
      feel good to know that the money we raise at Relay filters into the lives 
      of survivors at some point in time. My hope is that through this 
      fundraising future generations will have alternatives for treatment and a 
      higher success rate for a cure. Everyone is affected by cancer at some 
      time in their life.  Our stories are about different people with the same 
      disease, cancer.  
      <p>If you get a call to participate in Relay ..."just do it", everything else 
      will speak for itself.

      <p>The Pittsboro Relay for Life committee is saddened at the loss of Bonita 
      Cumbie who died as a result of a tragic head on collision on March 4th, 
      2005.  Our deepest sympathy goes out to her family.  Bonita was one of our 
      newest committee members and had been a team captain for The Olive 
      Branches from Mt. Olive Baptist Church for the last 3 years.
       
      <p>Donations in Bonita's memory can be made out to American Cancer Society 
      and sent with a note that says "In Memory of Bonita" to P. O. Box 874, 
      Pittsboro, NC 27312.  We will send an acknowledgement to her family and 
      money raised will be credited to The Olive Branches Team.

      <p>I'm not a participant from Pittsboro, I "Relay" in Cheshire, CT, but I saw 
      your site and wanted to let you know why I Relay. I hope you don't mind me 
      taking up some of your space. I Relay for my grandmother that I never knew 
      because she died from cancer before I was even born, I've been told that I 
      get my red hair and my love of reading from her, but I'll never know. I 
      Relay for Nick, one of the first friends I can remember, he had leukemia. 
      I remember him not having any hair and always wearing a fireman's hat, he 
      never got to grow up, he died at the age of 11. I Relay for my aunt who is 
      a breast cancer survivor, she is my proof that this disease can be beaten. 
      I Relay for my uncle, who I named my team after, The Corriveau Crusaders, 
      he survived stomach cancer, only to succumb to pancreatic cancer a year 
      later. There have been others in my life who fought their battles with 
      cancer, a friend's uncle, a teacher, a neighbor, some have won, others 
      have lost. The wound that is still the freshest and the most painful is 
      the one caused by the loss of "Pa". Pa was my surrogate grandfather, since 
      I never had one of my own, he was my friend's grandfather and I lived next 
      to him my entire life. He was an amazing man to everyone who knew him. He 
      had lung cancer and had had portions of lung removed years earlier, it 
      finally caught up to him and he died last March 2004. I Relay so I can do 
      my part to eradicate this awful disease.
