            <h>Buoyant Boks board the plane
            Monday July 05 2004
            <h>White holds out hope for Van Niekerk
            <p>It was a buoyant group of Springboks who addressed the media on 
            Monday, only hours before boarding a plane for Australasia - where 
            they will face the Pacific Islanders, New Zealand and Australia on 
            successive Saturdays.


                  <p>Buoyant: John Smit
             
            <p>Springbok coach Jake White remained confident that he will be able 
            to recall at least one of the four players who fell by the wayside 
            in the past few days, as injuries continued to take its toll.
            <p>White was adamant that Western Province flanker Joe van Niekerk will 
            board a plane bound for Australia on Saturday, only hours after he 
            will play for Western Province against the Lions in a Currie Cup 
            match in Johannesburg.
            <p>Van Niekerk was withdrawn from the touring squad last Friday, after 
            he aggravated a groin injury during a WP practice - ahead of their 
            first-round match against the Pumas.
            <p>But on Monday White again made it clear that he is confident Van 
            Niekerk - or Big Joe, as he is affectionately known - will come 
            through Saturday's Currie Cup game and be declared fit to play a 
            part for the Boks in their Australasian venture.
            <p>South Africa face the Pacific Iaslanders in Gosford on July 17, 
            before heading accross the Tasman to face New Zealand in a 
            Tri-Nations match in Christchurch a week later. They finish off with 
            an encounter against the Wallabies in Perth on July 31.
            <p>But White hopes to have Van Niekerk back for their opening 
            Tri-Nations match against the All Blacks, which gives him almost 
            three weeks to get ready.
            <p>Utility back Werner Greeff, who is struggling to overcome a knee 
            injury, is less likely to board a plane for Australasia soon. He 
            came on as a second-half replacement for Province at the weekend, 
            but afterwards had some trouble with his injured knee again.
            <p>He will go for some exploratory surgery on Tuesday, before a final 
            decision is taken, but the signs do not appear to be too good. In 
            fact it appears he may be sidelined for another two weeks.
            <p>Two other players - winger Jaque Fourie (hamstring) and loose 
            forward Juan Smith (hamstring) - have both been ruled out.
            <p>While Fourie and Smith will defenitely not take part in the away leg 
            of the Tri-Nations, White continued to hold out hope that Van 
            Niekerk will play a part.
            <p>"Joe will play for Western Province against the Lions on Saturday 
            and fly out to Sydney straight after the match," the coach told the 
            media.
            <p>"Joe needs game-time and it's up to him to decide how much time he 
            needs on the field. He must feel comfortable that he is ready."
            <p>The Bok said the latest injury setbacks may have disrupted his 
            preparations to some extent, but he was optimistic that his team was 
            up for the challenge.
            <p>"Sure, I would have liked one or two other guys, but injuries are 
            one of those things in rugby and we have to accept them,
            <p>"I don't think a coach ever gets his ideal team. But the guys who've 
            come into the squad have really done well for us and that will 
            certainly make selections at a later stage very difficult. I will, 
            however always select my strongest possible XV."
            <p>There was some good news on the injury front as well. Lock Bakkies 
            Botha, who was unable to play in the second Test against Ireland and 
            the one-off international against Wales because of an ankle injury, 
            has now fully recovered and he is likely to get some "game time" 
            against the Pacific Islanders.
            <p>The Boks coach was not concerned about the physical threat posed by 
            the Pacific Islanders, despite some of the big hits that are still 
            being felt in the Australian camp - after a number of Wallabies 
            limped out of their team's 29-14 win over the Islanders last 
            Saturday.
            <p>In fact White said he was looking forward to the match against the 
            Pacific Islanders, a team who has shown they are not scared to mix 
            it with the big guns of world rugby.
            <p>He added that South Africans have always been known as a team 
            capable of and willing to play the physical game.
            <p>"We've got some big tacklers as well and it'll be interesting to see 
            how physical they really are against us. It's going to be a very 
            tough test."
            <p>Bok captain John Smit said the team is eager to continue on their 
            winning ways, because it is "great" to be involved in a team where 
            the spirit is this great.
            <p>In fact, according to Smit, his team was targeting the Pacific 
            Islanders clash as if it was an extra Tri-Nations fixture.
            <p>"We want to taste success from the first game on tour," he told the 
            media gathering. "A good performance there will pull the team 
            together even more and it's another challenge we're looking forward 
            to," said Smit.
