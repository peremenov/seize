<h>    Linux Security: It's Not Just About Security
<h>   by Jon Lasser, in Editorials - Sat, Jan 8th 2000 23:59 PDT

<p>   Jon Lasser began the Bastille Linux Project in order to harden the
   security of Red Hat Linux, the distribution he uses at work. In the
   process, he began looking at the other distributions to see how they
   handle security updates, and he was not at all happy with what he
   found. In today's editorial, he shares his concerns and explains why
   it matters to you even if you do all your security monitoring for
   yourself.

<p>    As a professional Unix systems administrator, I'm concerned about
   system security. Keeping unauthorized users off my systems is simply
   part of my job; doing this requires vigilance in the form of
   monitoring performance, reading logs, and keeping patches up-to-date.
   For me, security is about security; it's about keeping my users'
   projects safe and keeping them comfortable despite a full-time
   connection to the Internet.

<p>    As Lead Coordinator of the Bastille Linux Project, a hardening script
   for Red Hat Linux, I thought my job was to make Linux more secure so
   beginning users could easily keep their boxes secure. Often, new Linux
   users have no experience as system administrators or often even any
   experience with Unix. I thought the best way to tackle the problem was
   to make it easy to do the right thing.

<p>    Recently, I've been asked lots of questions about Linux system
   security by reporters. Often, I'm put on the defensive right away:
   Does Linux have a security problem? Why is Linux less secure than
   other operating systems? Is open-source software inherently less
   secure than commercial systems?

<p>    I usually begin by explaining that more holes are reported in
   open-source software before they're exploited, and that the number of
   actually-exploited holes is no greater -- perhaps even less -- than
   commercial software. I explain that one reason there are so many
   break-ins into Linux systems is that there are so many Linux systems
   on the Internet, and I explain that Linux can be as secure as any
   other operating system.

<p>    But Linux does have a security problem. It's not a universal problem,
   but look at the following list of security Web sites, mailing lists,
   and update tools for some common Linux distributions:

<l> Red Hat Linux
<l>  Debian
<l>  SuSE
<l>  Mandrake
<l>  Caldera
<l>  Corel
<l> Turbo Linux
<l> Slackware Linux
         

 <p>  These are all mainstream Linux distributions, tending towards a
   general audience; at the least, they're not aiming at the router
   market or the embedded devices market. These are all products intended
   to be used by normal people and thrown up on a corporate network or
   even the Internet. Some may be aimed at relatively expert users, but
   I'm a fairly advanced user myself, and I still expect that my software
   distributor is watching out for security at least minimally. That's
   one of the reasons I don't roll my own distribution.

<p>   Of the eight common distributions I could think of, three have nothing
   whatsoever to do with security, and at least one of the others didn't
   seem to be doing anything useful. No wonder Linux has a security
   problem: while those four distributions have probably less than a
   quarter of the Linux market, they tend to be high-profile
   distributions which garner more than their share of media coverage.

<p>   These distributions aren't just putting their users at risk; they're
   damaging Linux's credibility and its image in the marketplace. Every
   time I'm asked by a reporter why Linux is so insecure, I have to
   consider Caldera, Corel, Turbo Linux, and Slackware before I can
   answer. These distributions' total lack of concern with security is an
   embarrassment to the entire Linux and Open-Source communities.

<p>   Because of these distributions, I'm forced to admit to reporters that
   many Linux installations are insecure, and there's little the average
   user can do about it without dedicating an inordinate amount of time
   to security work. Most users aren't paid to worry about security, as I
   am. For many, computing may be only a small part of their work. These
   people can't rightly be asked to read Bugtraq; they've got work to do.

 <p>  If only systems were kept up to patch, huge numbers of systems
   wouldn't be cracked. On the university campus where I work, systems
   have been exploited using the automount daemon bug which is more than
   a year old, and which has been patched nearly that long. Being a
   professional, I know that they shouldn't even be running it, because I
   know that they're not using it. But I can't expect them to know, and I
   can't even fix it myself: I didn't know that some of these machines
   existed until I found out that they'd been hacked. Asking these users
   to read a single, low-volume, vendor-specific mailing list is a pretty
   good solution -- when those lists exist.

 <p>  Experienced users should abandon Linux distributions which don't
   provide security fixes in a timely manner and post that information to
   a Web site, a mailing list, or both. They should abandon these
   distributions not because they necessarily need the security notices
   for themselves, but because these distributions are ruining Linux's
   image not only with novice users, but with the reporters and editors
   who shape managers' opinions on whether Linux is a viable solution.

 <p>  You may claim that you're a hobbyist, and you couldn't care less if
   businesses use Linux; that's your right, certainly. However, you lose
   nothing when businesses use Linux, you lose nothing when security
   updates are made available and publicized, and you gain nothing when
   businesses reject Linux because some vendor couldn't be bothered to
   package up an already publicly-available solution to a security hole.

 <p>  The rest of us do lose. It hurts our professional reputations when we
   stand behind a piece of software with frequent and highly-publicized
   security lapses. It wastes our time, tracking down hacked user
   machines for which we're not responsible and rebuilding them from the
   ground up. It wastes our money, when businesses and government
   agencies buy more expensive hardware and software for the illusion of
   security.

 <p>  Solving this problem isn't difficult or time consuming; simply pick
   distributions which express a basic level of concern for security
   issues, and let vendors know -- at trade shows, in e-mail, in letters
   to the editor of your favorite publication -- that security isn't just
   about security. It's about preserving our reputation for quality, and
   it's about saving time and money.

   <p>           Go back and read the sentence after that one ...

<p>   if you don't know what inetd.conf is for, if you don't knowwhere your startu
p scripts are [snip] ... then *you* *should* *NOT* *be**using* *UNIX*!!!!! 

  <p>                          Well, you shouldn't.

 <p>  there's no excuse for that level of incompetence in someonewho's educated en
ough to be a CEO. 

 <p>  Everyone who is interested should teach themselves about howcomputers
   and networks work, how to configure them, etc. But the realityis that
          in the long run, to use your car analogy, the people who
   configurecomputers are more like car mechanics, not car drivers. CEOs
    will not everlearn much, if anything, about how computers work. For
   them it's a tool, nota hobby. It's much more cost effective to have an
        expert configure their computer than it is for them to do it
                                themselves. 

<p>    Ok, then, let me take the car analogy one step further that that ...

 <h>                             Windows Vehicle:
<l> You turn on your machine, it boots Windows, you hit the Start
       button,you chose a program, it runs. If there's a problem, an
       "engine problem"indicator lights up on the dashboard.
<l> You get in your Geo, put the key in the ignition, turn it on, put
       thegearshift in Drive, step on the gas, and go. If there's a
       problem, a"General Fault" message pops up on the screen.

    <h>                           Linux Vehicle:
<l> You turn on your machine, it boots Linux/BSD/Solaris/FooNIX, you
       watchthe startup messages for any errors, you type in your login
       and password,you get a shell prompt, maybe you type "startx" to
       get a nice GUI. Younow have your choice of hudreds of commands,
       tools, utilities, compilers,editors, and apps to bring to bear on
       the problem at hand. If there's aproblem, a core file and a ton of
       log messages are spewed out to tell theuser exactly what part
       broke, and whether or not it's going to compromisethe stability of
       the rest of the system.
<l> You step out on the flight line, do a thorough walkaround of your
       F-22checking for any potential problems, hop in the cockpit, enter
       yourauthentication code, crank up the turbines, taxi out to the
       end of therunway, get clearance from the tower, and take off. You
       now have yourchoice of hundreds of possible maneuvers, and a wide
       array of avionics,ECM, and weaponry to bring to bear on the
       problem at hand. If there's aproblem, diagnostic information gets
       spewed out at the pilot to tell himexactly what part broke, and
       whether or not it's going to compromise theairworthiness of the
       aircraft.

<p>   The driver of the Geo doesn't need to know how the engine works, or
   how torepair it, in order to get from point A to poing B. That's what
       themechanic is for. If there's a problem, an "engine problem"
                    indicatorlights up on the dashboard.

  <p>      Likewise, the driver of the F-22 doesn't need to know how the
    radar,avionics, and engine work, or how to repair them, in order to
        shoot downthe other guy. That's what the ground crew is for.

 <p>       The persond driving F-22, however, must have a great deal more
   knowledgeof and competence in the physics involved in maneuvering the
                     vehicle thanthe driver of the Geo.

<p>      The "driver" of the Windows box doesn't need to know how files are
   storedon disk, or how an interrupt vector tells the CPU that the sound
      cardwants some attention. He does need to know enough to use the
    Start->ShutDown menu item, instead of just turning off the power. He
     shouldknow enough not to run any .exe files or open any word files
                      that haven'tbeen virus scanned.

  <p>   The "driver" of the Linux box doesn't need to know what an inode is,
      orhow System V IPC works. He does need to know how to log on and
     offproperly, and how to read basic error messages that show up on
      theconsole, how to use the shutdown command. He should know the
       basicsof configuring and compiling a kernel, and locking down
                       inetd.conf and therc.* files.

   <p>   In a corporate environment, most of the more complicated stuff for
     eithersystem is handled by the IT staff. They take care of things
    likefirewalls at the edge of the corporate network, and shutting off
     telnet,ftp, rpc, and other such things on machines that don't need
                                  them up.

   <p>  At home, it's a different story. Someone using a computer at home is
     mostlikely either dialing a modem in to an ISP, or connecting full
    time with anISDN or DSL link. (Unless they're a total geek, and have
            set up their own10.0.0.0 network behind a dedicated
                        NAT-ing/Firewalling box ...)

<p>     Sadly, most people don't realize the risk they're putting themselves
     at bydoing this without installing and configuring security tools.
      Even asimple thing like NukeNabber for Windows can help avert a
    systemcompromise, if the user is aware enough to yank the phone line
      out of thewall when a port scan is detected by it. I have little
     sympathy forpeople who's machines get compromised due to their own
   ignorance andincompetence. Anyone running a computer that's attatched
      to the'net needs to take the time to learn how to secure it. (By
   "running" Imean being the person responsible for it's maintenance, as
       in an IT personfor a corporation, or the owner/user of a home
                                 machine.)

<p>    That's just the way it is. If you want Linux for the masses, it mustbe
                                idiot proof.

<p>                            There's no such thing.

<p>    If no distro makes the idiot proof LAN workstation, then each network
                 sys admin will have to cook up their own. 

<p>     Who's better qualified to cook up a machine config that's suited to
         thelocal network environment that the local network admin?

<p>    Umm ... let's see ... rpm for RedHat, 

 <p>   I've used that one. Last time I checked, it did not add or removelinks
    from the rc.* directories, nor did it do a recursive dependancycheck
      to install all the packages that the package I want depends on.

 <p>    No, but it will tell you if you need to install another package that
      thisone depends on. That way, it doesn't install stuff it's not
                            telling youabout ...

 <p>   Yet installation programs magically can do this. They seem differentto
                                    me. 

<p>    If you want Windows' InstallShield Wizard, you know where to find it.

<p>    Well, some of the statements made in the original article (and many of
   theresponses) were just bound to start a religious flame war. Welcome
                  to thewonderful world of Linux geeks ...

<p>      I have to disagree with RichD's premise that every UNIX user must
               beresponsible for understanding UNIX security.

 <p>      My premise isn't even that every UNIX user should be responsible
   forunderstanding UNIX security. My premise is that every computeruser
    should be responsible for understanding basic computersecurity. The
     state of the general public's computer literacy is,IMNERHO, simply
                                 pathetic!

<p>     How many people simply assume it's safe to go into Windows and start
      uptheir Dialup Networking and connect to the Internet? How many
      peopleassume that because they use an ISP and have a dynamically
   assigned IPaddress that they can't get hacked? How many people assume
    it's ok toopen that Word file without virus scanning it because they
   "know" thatonly .exe files can contain viruses? How many people assume
      it's safe toget up from their workstation without locking their
                                  screen?

  <p>     From my point of view, that's just like driving off in a car not
     knowingwhere the brake pedal is, and assuming you're not going to
   crash intoanything. It's just like turning on a band saw and shoving a
    piece ofwood in the general direction of the blades without wearing
    safety glassesor knowing where the scram switch is, and assuming you
          won't get a splinterin your eye or cut your fingers off.

 <p>     A computer is a powerful, complex tool that, if properly applied,
     canboost productivity in the workplace to a great degree. Like any
   othertool, however, if it is not used correctly, it has the potential
                        to do agreat deal of damage.

 <p>      Linux advocates talk about displacing Windows, but it will never
     happenuntil secrataries and CEOs can be productive on Linux, too. 

 <p>    The tools are there, it's just a matter of R-ing TFM to learn how to
                                  usethem.

<p>      And believe me, they barely understand what their account name is.

  <p>      True. And there's no excuse for that level of incompetence in
                 someonewho's educated enough to be a CEO.

 <p>        One person must be able to maintain 10's or 100's of "secure
                            enough"Linux boxes.

<p>       One person, who has even just a little experience installing and
   securingLinux boxes, can. It would make a great internship opportunity
     for a CSstudent looking at getting into network administration ...

 <p>     You don't have to have a PhD in Computer Science to be able to use
      acomputer safely and effectively, just as you don't need to know
   thephysics and engineering of an internal combustion engine to drive a
    carsafely and effectively -- but, as with a car or a bandsaw or any
     otherpiece of equipment, a basic level of knowledge and competence
   isneeded. It is this lack of knowledge of the fundamentals of networks
       andtheir hazards that causes so many machines to get cracked.

 <p>     With regards to distro install scripts, one thing I find annoying
   isthat the scripts (the one's I've used, at least) only run at install
   time.I think a better way to do it would be to have an install script
   that detected thehardware, installed the kernel and other non-optional
   packages, thenrebooted into console mode. Then, use a general purpose
       tool (one that you could runagain later) to enable and disable
                  services, and install/uninstallsoftware.

<p>     Umm ... let's see ... rpm for RedHat, pkgtool for Slackware, Debian
     has apackage manager, FreeBSD has pkg_add pkg_delete and the ports
   system,linuxconf lets you adjust all your system settings from an easy
    to use andunderstand GUI (in X) or menu system (on the console) ...
                       what are youcomplaining about?

 <p>     Most distributions even let you select between a Workstation and a
        Serverinstallation, and adjust what daemons are available by
   defaultaccordingly. Perhaps they are a bit permissive with things like
     telnet,ftp, nfs, and other services, but that's only in accordance
      with the UNIXtradition, where these services are expected to be
     available. If you havea problem with that, there's always OpenBSD,
              which shuts everything exceptSSH off by default.

 <p>      Above and beyond that issue, and I'll make this point again and
          againuntil it's heard, it's not that hard to go and get
   yourselfinformed enough about your computer and OS to not make a total
                       ass ofyourself on the network!

 <h> Corporate LANs and distro install scripts
 <h>  by Andy Wiggin - Jan 11th 2000 13:11:39

 <p>   First, I'm glad the discussion has risen from the gutter. I think some
   ofthese slackeware types need to starting dealing with their anger...
   
 <p>     I have to disagree with RichD's premise that every UNIX user must
   beresponsible for understanding UNIX security. I'm a newer Linux user
     (lessthan two years), so I don't have the same perspective as the
    old-timers. Idon't see Linux as a hobbyist's toy, I see it as a tool
   that I'd like to beable to use at work (much as Mr. Lasser was talking
   about). In a LANsetting, not everyone is a sysadmin, and in fact, that
   could never work.People can be perfectly productive UNIX users without
      understandinganything about inetd.conf. I know I was for years.
      
   <p>   For Linux to make it in the corporate world, the boxes need to be
     easyto set up as LAN workstations and easy to keep up to date with
   softwarepatches. One person must be able to maintain 10's or 100's of
    "secureenough" Linux boxes. In my mind that should be the goal, and
        tools likeAutoRPM and Bastille Linux are the right approach.
	
<p>    Linux advocates talk about displacing Windows, but it will neverhappen
   until secrataries and CEOs can be productive on Linux, too. Andbelieve
           me, they barely understand what their account name is.
	   
 <p>     With regards to distro install scripts, one thing I find annoying
   isthat the scripts (the one's I've used, at least) only run at install
   time.I think a better way to do it would be to have an install script
         thatdetected the hardware, installed the kernel and other
     non-optionalpackages, then rebooted into console mode. Then, use a
   general purposetool (one that you could run again later) to enable and
    disable services,and install/uninstall software. That way turning on
   and off services wouldnot be such a big deal, since they could easily
    tweeked later using thesame, easy to use, vendor specific tool. This
     might make it more practicleto turn off more services by default.

<h> Security? distro independant.
<h>  by digitalunity - Jan 11th 2000 02:44:20

 <p>       I find fault not with Slackware, or Red Hat's policy on custom
     packagesbeing included. My issue only is with the install programs
    from thedistros. A linux install with all of the services turned off
              is fairlysecure. This is not entirely practical.
	      
 <p>     Anyone intending to use their computer as a server should make it
      theirresponsibility to keep themselves informed and their server
     running onlynew software. I find it a little humorous when someone
    sets up a webserver, and maybe an ftp server, and a portscan reveals
   20 open ports.Thats insecure. And that is about right for any default
   install of mostdistributions. I have always used slackware and yes, I
                   felt it was in abeta-stage until v7.0.
		   
  <p>   My message is only that multiple inetd.conf files should be included
    withevery distribution, and the user should have the opportunity to
                        choosefrom several options:
			
 <p>                  Secure: for single users - no open ports
   Medium: for remote-admin nodes - telnet, ssh, just the 'portant stuff
      Insecure: for the hacker who will do it all themself anyways :)
      
 <p>   I find it discontenting that distributions include soooo many services
                              onby default...
			      
 <p>                            but thats just me...
                           and I'm just the user
          digitalunity aka digitalun aka mike the hacker next door
  <p>                 bud - bag, can, bottle, keg. itsallgood.

 <h> Out of the box secure distro? One word ...
 <h> by RichD - Jan 10th 2000 17:11:39

 <p>     OpenBSD. By default, remote access services are disabled until the
           adminexplicitly goes into inetd.conf and enables them.

 <p>    Slimy is correct in saying that I miss the point of the main article
     in myprevious post. I wasn't aiming for it. I intended the post in
     contextwith the other replies talking about how there should be a
     distro that is"secure" out of the box. (I guess I missed that by a
                                hair, too ;)

<p>        The simple truth remains that there just is no such thing. The
   securityof any system, no matter what OS it is running, is a function
     of thecluefulness of the admin. A well run Linux box will be more
   secure than apoorly run OpenBSD install. A well run NT server will be
            more secure thata shoddily maintained Solaris 7 box.

 <p>     Of course, the only way to have a system that is completely secure
    frombeing hacked on the 'net, is not to have it on the 'net at all.
    Then allyou have to deal with is the security of physical access to
      the machineitself ... we've all seen the draconian measures that
   Hollywood producerscan think of to try and do that, and Tom Cruise was
        still able to stealdata off of it in Mission Impossible ...

 <h> Missing the point
<h>  by slimy - Jan 10th 2000 14:49:17

 <p>    While I agree with RickD's comment (especially the first paragraph),
             Ibelieve it misses the main point of the article.
	     
  <p>       Clearly, one must learn Unix if one expects to administer a
        Linuxmachine. And that includes home users. But still, most
      LinuxDistributions that I have run across, Slackware and Debian
   included, makeassuptions about system installations that are not, from
      a securitystandpoint, logical. For example, installing a telnetd
   server by defaultis probably not a good idea. Having it installed and
     configured to acceptremote connections by default is horrific! Yet
   this was the case when Iinstalled Debian 2.1. Debian 2.2 (Potato) is a
     little smarter than this,but thats not the official release (yet).
 <p>       As anyone who has delt with security issues for some time will
     tellyou: the best security policy you can adopt is "that which is
   notexplicitly allowed is denied". More distributions need to take this
                                intoaccount.
 <p>   If I want a telnet server, I will ask for it. And when I install it,I
        would expect that: at best, it would not aceept connections
     fromanywhere until I told it otherwise; at worst, it would accept
             localconnections only, until I told it otherwise.

<h>  Linux, security, and the Common Man(tm)
<h>   by RichD - Jan 10th 2000 13:17:07

<p>       Linux is a UNIX style operating system. UNIX was not originally
   intendedfor the "casual" or "home" user ... they just didn't exist in
                                   1969.
				   
<p>       Linux, the BSDs, and any UNIX flavor, for that matter, requires
   theuser to have a given level of cluefulness. IMNERHO, this is a Good
    Thing. The plain, simple, ugly truth is that if you don't know what
   inetd.conf isfor, if you don't know where your startup scripts are and
    how to edit them,if you don't know how to set up your anonymous FTP
     server correctly, etc.etc. etc. ... then *you* *should* *NOT* *be*
                            *using* *UNIX*!!!!!
			    
 <p>           The flip side of that is that anyone can easily obtain
    thedocumentation and learn how to do all of these things, as well as
      all theother tasks required to keep a UNIX system up and running
    properly. Thishas the effect (or at least the potential) of raising
             the computerliteracy level of the general public.
	     
 <p>        Sadly, most people think of their computer the same way they
    thinkabout their television set, their microwave, and their car. The
   way I seeit, computers are actually more akin to power tools -- if you
    don't readthe instructions and/or get proper training in their use,
                           you're gonna gethurt.
			   
 <p>       There are a few simple truths about the Internet as it stands
               todaythat many, if not most, people overlook:
	       
<l>  The Internet, like Downtown(tm), is *NOT* a safe place. Anyone
      whoattatches a computer or a network to the Internet is placing
    themselves atrisk. There are malicious people out there who want to
   steal yourinformation, just like there are malicious people out there
    who want tosteal your wallet. There are Script Kiddies out there who
    want to defaceyour website, just as there are Junior Gangbangers out
     there who want totag your house/car/fence/wall/place of business.
<l>  You gotta cover your own ass. Ultimately, your computer's safetyis
        your responsibility, just like your personal safety is your
    ownresponsibility. Companies have sysadmins who get paid to keep the
    networksecure. They also have security guards and alarm systems and
     such to keepthe physical premeses physically secured. At home, you
     have locks on yourdoors, and perhaps an alarm system, to help keep
   intruders out of yourhome. I say "help" because the fact remains that
     if someone really wantsto break into your house, they will, alarm
   system notwithstanding. Thesame is true for computers on the 'net. If
       someone *really* wants to getin, they will. There are, however
         measures that can be taken to make itmuch more difficult.
	 
 <p>      Yes, there are people out there who are trying to help look out
      foreverybody's safety, just like there are police patrolling the
      streetslooking out for everyones safety ... and they're about as
      effective. Thefact remains that if you don't know how to spot a
      potential mugger, and ifyou don't bother learning basic personal
    safety practices (like scanningthe area for potential baddies before
   unlocking your car door orapproaching your home, or being able to spot
    the scratches on the lock anddoor frame that indicate forced entry),
       you're much more likely to getmugged than the person who *has*
                      bothered to learn these things.
 
 <p>  Similarly, if you don't bother learning basic computer safetypractices
     (like editing inetd.conf, and configuring firewalling), you'remuch
        more likely to get cracked that the person who *has* learned
                                thesethings.
         
 <p> 	 It doesn't take much. Anyone who has any semblance of
     intelligencehigher that that of an earthworm can figure out how to
   edit theirinetd.conf file to turn off unecessary daemons. Configuring
    IPChains is apiece of cake, if you bother to read the FAQ and HOWTO.

 <p>     I have no sympathy for anyone who whines about how hard it is to setup
   a Linux/BSD/UNIX system. "But Windows just works" is the party line...
    primarily because most people never actually *do* a Windows install.
    They buy computers from the local consumer electronics store, which
     comewith Windows preinstalled (by someone who gets paid to install
   Windows ondozens or hundreds of computers a day), and have no clue how
     insecure theyare when they hit that Dialup Networking button to go
                              surfing the net.
         
	  <p> At least Linux and the other freeware Unices *have* easily
      accessiblemechanisms like inetd.conf, and firewalling tools like
   IPChains that allowthem to be made more secure. At least the users of
    these systems know (orshould know) that there are security issues to
                               be addressed.
 
  <p> Most Windows users are blissfully unaware that they are wide open
    tomany attacks that can crash their machines, and many more attacks
      thattake advantage of their ignorance to use email attatchments,
    JavaScript,ActiveX, and other such methods to install backdoors into
    their systems. Furthermore, most Windows users have no simple method
     to block suchattacks against their home box that they use to dial
                           directly into the'net.

 <p> 			   When these users load Linux, without taking the time to learn aboutthe
           issues involved, they remain just as ignorant of their
       securitysituation as they were when they were running Windows.

 <p>        People take the time to attend self defense and "street
     smarts"seminars, and martial arts classes to learn how to protect
    themselves inthe Real World(tm). They watch the news to find out if
    there is a serialrapist in town this week. They lock their doors and
     windows at night, andturn on the alarm system to keep the burglers
                                    out.
 
 <p>  Is it really to much to expect people to take the time to learn
     therelatively simple techniques (like editing out unneeded daemons
   frominetd.conf and their startup scripts, and configuring firewalling
    likeIPChains) that will lock down their Linux box to keep the Script
                                Kiddiesout?

 <h> ok ok enough bickering

  <p>      Agreed, the paper did seem like an attack on Slackware do to the
    completemisconception about Volkerding's view on security. The sites
     and listshave been pointed out enough in the comments. The man has
                        appologized solets move on.
 
 <p>  This article was a good one. Unfortunately most people missed the
    point. I don't think it was intended to tell us what distribution to
     use, or whoto boycott; rather, it was intended to tell us what we
    should do aboutsecurity, why we need it, etc. The common quote from
    most web sitedefacers is "Security is a Myth". This is true for the
      most part, but ifwe all look at security and pay attention to it
         rather than sloughing itoff, it doesn't have to be a myth.
 
 <p>  Anyway, I lack sleep and I'm at work...so I hope this made sense...

  <h> Let's get the facts straight
  <h>      by Olaf Kirch - Jan 10th 2000 12:08:03

   <p>   Being the person at Caldera who's responsible for security issues, I
    feltnot just a little insulted by your claim that Caldera is one of
         thedistributions that doesn't to anything about security.

  <p>       You write, in trying to apologize for your unfair treatment of
      Slackware:``In the old days [...] Slackware had huge numbers of
   security holes.''This sentence enforces my suspicion that your article
   is based much moreon dated stereotypes than real understading of what
                     goes on in the Linuxsecurity area.

  <p>       If you go back to some time around 95, I grant you that Linux
    distributions used to resemble leaky buckets more than a secure OS.
   This,and the fact that Linux was ignored both by CERT and (to a large
    degree)by bugtraq as well lead to the establishment of various Linux
           securityresources--such as a the linux-security list.

  <p>    Since then, most Linux distributors, including Caldera, have started
   toput a lot more emphasis on security. There is even a certain amount
        of information sharing and coordination concerning security
                      issuesamong Linux distributors.

 <p>     I have personally audited most if not all setuid applications and a
   number of network servers shipped with OpenLinux. Linux as a whole has
     profited from this. And we're not the only Linux vendor trying to
                   address security problems proactively.

  <p>        Working in the security area myself I can on the other hand
    understandyour apparent frustration. Making an operating system more
    secure is anuphill battle you cannot win. Distributors make mistakes
    in integratingsoftware with their product (or they make choices you
    consider a mistake).Programmers insist on putting the same bugs into
     their programs over andover again (do a grep strcpy over the pine
     sources one day). Many usersexpect things to "just work" and don't
                take security serious until theyget hacked.

 <p>     However don't blame distribution maintainers for a problem that has
    manymore facets--especially if your assignment of blame is based on
                              sloppyresearch.

 <p>    On the overall scale, Linux security has improved a lot over the past
    fewyears--and while I agree that there's a long way to go, progress
    willdepend at least as much on creating more secure software in the
         firstplace as on the vendors' timely delivery of patches.

 <h>  Another Slack Flame?
  <h>  by KL Davis - Jan 9th 2000 09:42:16

  <p>                                  Well...
 
 <p>  I read this a few hours ago, but thought it best to hold any
                 commentsfor awhile -- A while has passed.

 <p> 		 First, I do not blame Mr. Lasser for this article. Having experienceas
      an editor of a small, international law enforcement journal... I
   knowthat the old adage "Don't shoot me, I'm just the messenger" holds
   no waterin the journalism business. Mr. Covey... shame now, did we not
   learn atleast one thing from the cinema classic "Real Genius"? "Never
   forget tocheck your references!" (I think the kids still like it when
                           I "get down"verbally).

 <p> 			   Mr Lasser, I note that you have made an attempt, albeit feeble,
   butwhat appears to be an attempt non the less at saying you are sorry?
   Ifthis was an apology... then I, as a card carrying Slacker, accept --
                                 Thankyou.
 
 <p>  Now if I may make a comment or two? I do not claim to know even
     afraction of what you, MR. Lasser, know about computer security. I
    onlystarted *tinkering* with computers in 1984 -- The majority of my
     securityexperience is more with MP5s than MD5. But, as anyone who
    knows me (or hashad the misfortune of finding my web site) knows, I
            have made a realdedication towards network security.
 
 <p>  I seem to have taken a different, I like to think more
   practical,approach to finding what flavor of Linux I would use for my
     firewall andsecure OS base. Rather than which distro was the most
   popular and had themost support, I chose the one that (IMO) needed the
     least work: Slackware! But that is not why I am writing, I hope to
        offer a simple explanation thatseems too often missed -- Or,
   misunderstood. Anyway, this is what I havepicked up in the last couple
                               of decades...
 
 <p>  The notion that anyone can completely protect something is
     silly...noble, but silly. There is no security panacea -- and look
     closely atthose who claim to have it, odds are there little wagons
     have the words"snake oil" freshly painted over on the sides. It is
    this sort ofthinking that drives a company to spend $180,000.00 on a
    high-tech,laminated steel door - mounted in hardened and reinforced
     concrete & steelframe and casement - featuring hinges and locksets
    made of solidunobtanium! Then put that door between two windows made
                              of genuineglass?

 <p>      This is the same rational that has System Administrators walkingaround
                  touting their new mega buck, AI powered,
   Super-Cyber-Crypt-KeeperSoftware... while EVERY terminal (even the one
     that customers can use inthe lobby) has a functional floppy drive!
                          (yes, I have seen this).

 <p>  Security (my definition) is a measure of time -- a double ended
   timeline, separated in the middle by an event... a breach or loss (X).
   Onethe left side of that event is the time leading up to it, the time
   beforeit happens -- not if, rather when. To the right of the event, is
   the timeit will take to recover from the event -- to fully negate the
                                   loss.
              |-------------------------------(X)-----------|
 
 <p>  Security is any effort that moves the event (X) further to the
       right,in fact all effort should be to move the event as far as
    possible to theright -- in a perfect world, a security compromise is
     only a threat untilit is discovered, after action and contingency
       plans are already testedand in place... negation is immediate.

 <p>        Sorry, I have rambled on for far too long now... I do respect you
    andyour efforts with the Bastille project, thanks! And BTW, there is
    onefool proof plan for securing something, used every day actually,
    theGovernment has printed several manuals on how to do it even! ...
                             TotalDestruction.

 <h>  a secure distribution
  <h>                   by Phil Howard - Jan 9th 2000 04:15:04

 <p>       Different distributions try to address different issues as seen
       bydifferent kinds of users, all with different experiences and
   differentgoals. The very fact we have so many distributions attest to
        thediversity of the user base. This is something that Linux
     distributions(and their BSD cousins) have over that commercial OS
                             we've heard about.

 <p> 			     One size does NOT fit all. It never did, and it never will. What
   ahacker needs, or what a hobbyist needs, or what a web site needs, or
   whata system administrator needs, or what an office manager needs, or
          what asalesman needs ... all these things are different.
 
 <p>  I can certainly says from experience as a system administrator thatthe
       most secure systems are the result of a skilled administrator
    takingthe time to get all the necessary information (and keep up to
    date so youare a moving target) and apply all the necessary upgrades
     andconfigurations. However, a system administrator is not going to
    besetting up most machines anymore as Linux begins to bump out that
     other OSfrom the desktop. Indeed, many server situations fall into
      that arena. IfI were to set up and configure a Linux desktop for
     someone, there are a LOTof things I'd be doing to the system AFTER
    installing the distribution,with security changes being in the lead
   position, and other things likemanageability being next (for example,
            cleanup scripts that ensure logsdon't fill up /var).
 
 <p>  There are a lot of things a distribution could do to make life HELLfor
       a system administrator, but making EVERYTHING be defaulted to
   turnedOFF is not one of them. I've used both Slackware and Redhat and
     I have todo a lot to both (more to Redhat but still a significant
   amount toSlackware) to make them secure. I don't clean inetd.conf ...
   I shut offinetd itself ... on many systems. Every distribution should
     leave everyservice that could listen on a port or pipe turned off,
      even lpd. Duringinstall, and at any time later, there can be the
   option to enable specificservices. But unless those actions are taken,
     the services should beinstalled in such a way they are not running
                         until properly turned on.
 
 <p>  This would be to the best benefit of end users who have little or
         notime to keep themselves security aware, and as a system
    administrator, I'dmuch rather have to go turn things on than have to
    turn them off. It wouldnot break any distribution to do it this way.

  <h>  Oh my.
  <h>                 by Daniel T. Chen - Jan 9th 2000 04:10:57
 
  <p>       Jon Lasser brings up some very good points, and his editorial
      iswell-suited to the Linux community. As one of several student
   Unixsysadmins in the computer science department, I have to deal with
   the sametypes of things he does. One of the reasons we've opted not to
     go withLinux 100% but instead concentrated on IRIX and Solaris is
   because (1) wefeel IRIX has a proven track record of being more stable
      and secure thanLinux; and (2) because Solaris provides a proven
    environment in which ourCS students can code. This does not prevent
   many attempts to exploit ourmachines, however. On the average, I spend
    nearly twenty minutes *perhour* scrounging through logs and checking
    stats to ensure that my fellowstudents are safe at what they do best
   (coding). This does not come at an easy price. Since I'm only one of a
     fewsecurity-minded student sysadmins, I have to make sure that my
   coworkersare kept current on the latest exploits, security advisories
     and fixes,etc. [I mean this as no offense to anyone, but I've also
   noticed that the ircnetwork EFNet seems to split a lot more often now
     that Linux ircds havepopped up. Things weren't this way when they
   stuck to *BSD daemons. *sigh*] I simply wish we could all just listen
    to what Jon Lasser was trying topoint out instead of nitpicking over
    the details of whether or not aparticular distribution has security
                            lists/pages/whatnot.

          checkingfor updates, in a year that's a loss of $100k...

  <h> Abandon Slackware 3.0 Instead Use RedHat 4! :P
 <h>    by iNarf - Jan 8th 2000 22:52:46

  <p>     "But I'm really curious as to why everyone took this as an attack
    onSlackware, specifically. It certainly wasn't intended to be that."
 
 <p>  Simple Answer:
 
 <p>  "These distributions aren't just putting their users at risk;
   they'redamaging Linux's credibility and its image in the marketplace.
   Every timeI'm asked by a reporter why Linux is so insecure, I have to
      considerCaldera, Corel, Turbo Linux, and Slackware before I can
   answer. Thesedistributions' total lack of concern with security is an
       embarrassment tothe entire Linux and Open-Source communities."
  
 <p>   "Experienced users should abandon Linux distributions which don't
   providesecurity fixes in a timely manner and post that information to
       a Web site,a mailing list, or both. They should abandon these
    distributions notbecause they necessarily need the security notices
     for themselves, butbecause these distributions are ruining Linux's
    image not only with noviceusers, but with the reporters and editors
    who shape managers' opinions onwhether Linux is a viable solution."
     
 <p>      [ Further I found this funny

 <p>  "If only systems were kept up to patch, huge numbers of systems
     wouldn'tbe cracked. On the university campus where I work, systems
   have beenexploited using the automount daemon bug which is more than a
           year old,and which has been patched nearly that long"
 
 <p>  What "Linux" Distribution would a university be running? ]
 
 <p>  I believe the only thing that is going to hurt your reputation as a
       linuxprofessional is not collecting the [current] facts before
                     commenting oncontroversial items.

 <p> 		     Yes of course I am bias towards Slackware. It is in my opinion the
    bestdistribution. I have used Debian, RedHat and Stampede along some
   of theBSD flavors. I am not going to say Slackware is the most secure
     Linux, butthat is only because I agree with the comment about the
     administratorsbeing the security. As far as getting a distribution
          secure in a shortamound of time, Slackware is darn good.
 
 <p>  Recently a RedHat loving (Once Slackware despising) friend of my'n
   wasamazed at how easy slackware is to configure ( without all the junk
    in theway ) and has since changed distributions. Slackware is quite
   offtensmashed and bashed. It seems mostly by people who either haven't
       used it,or NEED a GUI with pretty pictures to run a computer.
 
 <p>  You are in the position to influcence people. Obtaining an article on
   amajor open source / linux site. It is your responsibility to at least
     knowwhat products / projects you are telling people to "abandon".
  
 <p>   "I certainly hope (and to some degree expect) that this situation's
        beencleaned up by now, but this made it impossible to audit
    slackware'ssecurity if you wanted to." Well why don't you try it out
   before the nexttime you go publicly trashing it! I certainly hope (and
    to some degreeexpect) you will go back and review the comments made.

 <h>  Missing the point...
   <h>                  by Bill Duncan - Jan 8th 2000 22:10:21

 <p>       Unfortunately most people who've responded have missed the whole
   point. All major distributions which I'm aware of come out of the box
    with toomany services enabled, and too many potential holes for new
    users to copewith. They could all use a front-end script or dialogue
    which would asknew users what actually needs to be enabled, and then
    disable everythingelse by default. I would rather assume that users
   who need the serviceswill need to learn enough about the process to be
                   able to enable themthemselves anyway.
 
 <p>  The author makes a good point that if newbie users start
   havingsecurity problems all over the place because services they know
    nothingabout and could care less about are enabled by default, this
   could have adetrimental impact on the Linux community in general with
    bad press if,for example, many thousands of these unsuspecting users
                  become mail relaysand stop-over points.
 
 <p>  I've used a number of the major distributions, and to my knowledgethey
        are all guilty of this. They should come out of the box with
                      allservices disabled by default.
 
 <p>  The users who need these services will do the necessary research (itis
     hoped) to be able to use them in the most secure way possible, and
       tokeep on top of security advisories etc. But you can't expect
   everyone whojust wants to use Linux for themselves to be on top of it
                                    all.

  <p>   The feedback gained from this editorial demonstrates one facet of the
      linuxcommunity that I find tremendously childish and immature -
     religiousdedication to individual distributions. As much as I am a
    linux advocate;linux is an operating system, to be used. Some people
     appear to shift thefocus from the operating system to a particular
      vendor's own cobblingtogether of software and scream loudly when
         there's even a hintthat somebody is 'attacking' their pet
                               distribution.

  <p>       Jon stats that when he used slackware it was way back when the
      securitywasnt considerd. And that his article was written not in
   attempt to attackslackware and other distro's but to show the need for
   security in linux. Hemight not of ment for the attack on slackware but
    when a nobody, nerverused linux user read's your article and decides
      to go with linux from thefacts that u offer he will determain to
   follow redhat when your facts arntuptodate or even fully looked into.
   Thats why it attacks slackware becausethe pertential users belive what
       they read. And this lowers the possableusers for slackware to
    increase. Also i couldnt write a arctile onWindows systems if i had
    only run win 3.1 and win 98/2000 was latestventure. I would only be
                 showing my lack of facts on that subject.

 <h> Read the message, not the words
   <h>                 by Daniel Lawson - Jan 8th 2000 20:17:55

  <p>       I think people are getting a little bit too inflamed over the
                       mistakesconcerning slackware.
 
 <p>  The point being made was, a lot of people use linux that do NOT
     havetime to, or even understand how to, secure their systems. Its
   exactly thesame with other more mainstream OSs - I know of several ppl
   who claim tobe NT admins, and yet dont even know where the MS security
                               websites are.
 
 <p>  Sure, when I install a linux system I go through and clean out
   inetd,add a decent ipchains firewall if appicable, and upgrade all the
                  packagesthat I know have security flaws.
 
 <p>  Does Jane Bloggs who just installed a redhat 6.0 (or *any* system)
    toact as their companies dialup networking server and webserver know
                               how todo this?
 
 <p>  Would she know what cron *was*, much less that the redhat 6.0
     rpmhappened to have a buffer overflow in it? (I think it was rh6.0
                                  anyway)
 
 <p>  Would she know what the significance of inetd.conf is, much less howto
                                 secure it?
 
 <p>  My take on the original article was not a dig at any particular
      linuxdistribution - but a point about the level of education out
   there. And,hand in hand with education, we have ease of accessability.

 <p>    Half an hour a day, or even 5 minutes a day, might be enough to
    coverthe headlines of bugtraq and a vendor-specific security mailing
     list, butsomeone telling Jane that she needed to upgrade her cron
   package becauseof a nasty buffer overflow which could give root access
                          wont mean a thingunless
			  
 <l>  Jane knows if she uses the package
 <l>  Jane knows if its relevant
 <l>  Jane knows *how* to upgrade - be it installing a new rpm / deb,
      orgrabbing a source tarball, applying the relative patches, and
                                compilingit
    
 <p>     I think there are a lot of people who use linux, because of the
           hypesurrouding it, who dont know what they are doing.
 
 <p>  In my opinion, workstation distributions *should* be more or
    lesssecure by default - with the exception of unforseen things like
      bufferoverruns in packages etc. Why do you need to telnet into a
     workstation?disable it by default. Why do you need ftp? pop3/imap?
    www? disable it. Ifthe user needs it, they can set it up themselves.
                            They need to learn.
 
 <p>  Similar sort of tactics should be taken on a server distribution.
 

 <p>  Oh no, people will cry, that will make it too hard! No one will
                         uselinux if its too hard!
    
 <p>     Education....
 
 <p>  We dont need distributions that do everything for us - unless werolled
   it ourselves, and know what it does. What we do need is informationon
                            *how* to secure it.
         I thought the Bastille project was a good idea (although i
      neveractually used it). Things like this need to be fostered and
                                encouraged.
  
 <p>   We currently have screeds of disjoint man pages, HOWTOs which
   dontagree with your distribution (most of the ones i've read appear to
         workwith slackware, and bear no relevance to redhat), and
     package-suppliedreadmes that can also bear no resemblance to your
                       distribution-patchedbinaries.
 
 <p>  I make a generalisation above, I know. But we need more
        distributionspecific information on how to do these things.
     And it needs to be centralised, and put in a 'to-do' list so that
                   newusers can *find* it easily enough.
 
 <p>  Hmm. I could have spent the time it took writing this, to insteadwrite
   a redhat-specific HOWTO's on securing your workstation by lockingdown
                inetd, and checking for recent rpm updates.
  
 <p>   Regards,
     <p>                                Daniel
              <p>        "Security through Education", maybe?

   accident by stating thatSlackware did not have any mailing lists etc,
   especially since he is doing so without even using Slackware him self,
                     which at least he washonest about.
  
 <p>   The Slackware Linux developement team puts a lot of time into
    makingsure the distribution is as secure as posible before releasing
   it, andpersonaly I think if Redhat put a little more time into do the
     same beforereleasing each dist. it might be a bit more secure it's
   self. Maybe I ambias to Red Hat because I have seen it hacked so many
   times and at thesame time not very many people can hack Slackware, or
   maybe it's just myexperiance with Slackware that has drawn me to it, I
    am not sure. Onethings for certain though, Slackware does have less
             exploits released foreach of there distributions.
 
 <p>  Finaly, the only thing I have to say is I appriciate these fourms,
    itgives us a chance to hear opinions from lots of people on security
    and notjust one persons views. I think the only reason that Jon has
   recieved somuch flaming on his editorial is because he didn't take the
    time to thinkthat before you judge something you should use it your
    self. Many peopleare opinionated on which Linux system people should

   <p>                     Hi, just some simple questions.
 <l>  Can you _really_ make a system secure?
 <l>  Can you _really_ build a foolproof out-of-the-box
    linuxdistribution that is secure without the user knowing what (s)he
                       is doing("linux for dummies")?
 <l>  OpenBSD is AFAIK considered one of the most secure OSs
   available.How much time do you expect a sys admin to invest in system
                        security tokeep it that way?
 <l>  Why do you expect average linux users to act more efficientlythan
            experienced unix system admins concerning security?
  <p>                                  So long,

  <p>   I think that there has been an adequate listing of the incorrect facts
      inthis article. The author should probably go back, re-think the
      premise,get his facts straight, and re-write and re-submit this
   editorial. Idon't think that something so obviously full of omissions
   and (yes, evenwe Linux people do it) FUD should be left posted in such
   a high-profilelocation. And Mr. Covey, (or someone from the FM staff)
      please do alittle fact-checking of your own on these? Thank you.

 <p>     5 minutes a month is bullshit, if users dont want to spend any brain
    powerperhaps they shouldn't be using computers at all? And as far as
     bettering the security on the net, im sure most distribs aresecure
   when they're released, it's just after time that people go lookingfor
      problems, which is a good thing, but that is also why you should
    belooking at least once a day, if you want to keep your box secure.
    And my final comment for the day, when something has a mailing list,
     suchas slackware, it shows the maintainers are looking out for the
   problemsand putting them at one central location for the users to look
   at, see aproblem, then go and get the patch or do whatever needs to be
                                   done.

 <p>                                   Come on!

 <p>  Just because a Linux distribution has a mailing list about security
                       doesn't mean it's more secure!
       Just because Microsoft has a security update webpage for their
      products doesn't mean IIS isn't the most hacked web platform on
                               earth, either.

 <p> 			       As an admin of a primarily slackware site for 3 years and an abuser
   of linux distributions since kernel 1.2.8, one of the keys things you
        can do to discover how good your distributions security is:
                         find / -perm +6000 -print
 
  <p> Another point in the favor of slackwares' security is that the
        number one remote crack on the net for linux distributions,
     'imap', was not defaultly enabled in slackware. This is not to say
     that slackware has not had security holes, but they have normally
          been lesser than the red hat or derived red hat distros.

 <p> 	  I am pleased that the slackware community has been vocal here,
            good work, folks! and thank you Patrick Volkerding!

   <p>                             ok... here goes.
  
 <p>   You are wrong. Period.
 
 <p>  I am a linux advocate. not a Slackware or Debian or Redhat or
    *linuxadvocate. Your blatent disregard for the facts is normal . No
    one seemsto care to research a liltle before going off on some rant
      about someinformation they know very little about. You aparently
    didn't even botherto email the heads of the distros to get a little
   info. You just went offsaying how your selected distro's security was
                    the best... here are a fewexamples.
 
 <p>  You mention "no official tool for automatic update."
     By automatic do you mean... gets the patches and installs for you,
   youget the patches (some format. rpm, deb,slack tgz, whatever) and it
    autoinstalls? what? If you want a deamon to install patches for you
      over theinternet, you dont know the first thing about security.

 <l>  your computer desides its time to check for updates.

 <l>  I hacked your local nameserver to point (whatever).(whatever) at
    mybox, and set up an package distrobution server for whatever client
     is usedin whatever distro. you resolve to me and get a backdoored
                 in.telnetd orwhatever. boom. your rooted.

 <p>  "Slackware Linux "
       
 <l>  "No known web page for security "
         try: ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/linux/slackware-7.0/patches/
      There are all the patches. the Changelog.txt file tells you what
                    theyare and why you would need them.

 <l>  "No known mail list for security"
       Maybe if you went to www.slackware.com and clicked the little
        "mailinglists" link you would see the slackware-security and
           slackware-anouncelists. even avalible in journal form!
 <l>  "No known tool for security updates"
                      There are several ways to do it.
                            installpkg [pkgname]
                                  pkgtool

 <p> 				  here again "Forgive them Father... they know not what they do..."

 <p>  You tell people to abandon linux distros based on your lies.
    Aparentlyyou say... screw everything else... Get Redhat (top of the
                      list), Debian,SuSe or Mandrake.
 
 <p>  You say those "other" distros damage linux's credability... You
    damagelinux's credability. You make blatently wrong statments out of
     lack ofknowledge and lack of desire to research an article before

    Really, non-hackers just can't be bothered with this kind of stuff.
   That's why, if you want to improve the overall security of the net and
      thereputation of Linux as a whole, you need to secure it at the
     source: thedistributions need to be more secure by default, and it
   needs to bepossible for installations to remain secure without the end
    users havingto spend any brainpower on it at all. Because they just
                                   won't.

     'the old days' here; we're talking `today`.I hope you get a lot of
    flames on the subject, as you flameda lot of good distributions out
   there. Even in your sorrymessage you don't stop flaming and make wrong
       assumptionsabout certain distributions, since these cannot be
   calledfacts. I don't know/care if you're getting paid to do thisbut it
      certainly looks that way. Well, you obviously got aname now, Jon

 <h>  Slackware, security, and so forth
  <h>                      by Kobaz - Jan 8th 2000 15:44:14

  <p>    I noticed about 3 people claiming that Slackware is quote "the most
    securedistrobution" around. This is in fact not true, and neather is
       saying"Redhat is the most secure" or Debian or Caldera, or any
   distrobution orOperating system. Even your linux box in the corner of
       your office with astatic ip, with just telnet and ftp services
   running, and all the latestpatches you can think of put on it; is ALOT
   less secure then if you pullout the ethernet wire. In this day and age
       there is no "most secured"linux distrobution. There is always
       something else you can do to make itjust a little more secure.
  
 <p>   All the linux distrobutions include programs written by not the
       peoplewho released the distrobution. Which means in fact, that
   hundreds ofdifferent programs, written by hundreds of different people
     are on thesame computer. Thos will also mean that there is a very
     likely chancethat one or more of those programs will have security
      problems. And I amnot just talking about Linux, or just Unix in
    general. Look at Windows 9598 and certan versions of NT: Hundreds of
      programmers work on them, fromone major company, and there was a
    mistake in codeing that caused remoteusers to be able to disconnect
    them from the internet. Something likethat could happen in the linux
        world also, a popularly used program thathas a tragic flaw.

 <p> 	Personally though, as many other people have said, when
     firstinstalling any distrobution they have to spend time fixing up
   inetd.confdisableing services that arent needed. Slackware is the same
    way, alongwith other problems. So you can't say that out of the box
    Slackware is themost secure, because it just plain isn't. Neather is
                                 anything.

   <p>      But if I can't hold someone to past mistakes, how can I judge
   currentperformance when I'm measuring the invisible (as good security
                                  is)?:-)

  <p>     Exploits come out for Red Hat first because there are more targets
    onthe net. Exploits used to come out for SunOS 4.x for precisely the
    samereason, but that didn't mean that Ultrix was more secure. (Point
     of fact,it probably wasn't, it was just less tested.) And the fact
    that Red Hatreleases security fixes fairly promptly means that it's
     possible to securethe system in a pretty much up-to-date fashion.

  <p>     But that only answers half the question: so now I know why people
    takeSlackware to be the target (because I made a mistake which gave
    them afoothold from which to attack me), but why do they think it's
     all aboutRed Hat? On the basis of the article, it seems clear that
    SuSE, Debian,and Mandrake are all probably more secure than Red Hat.
   The fact that I'vegot a whole project just to secure Red Hat seems as
   much proof as any thatit's not especially secure -- but the fact that
     they've got some securityresources certainly means they're trying.

    <p>    (And I started Bastille not to secure RH for myself, but because
   thereare dozens or hundreds of user-administered Red Hat boxes on the
     campus ofthe university where I work. I need a way to secure those
   machines when Ihave no direct control over them -- which means I need
                 to secure the OSthey're already running.)

   <p>     At any rate, other than the blurb up top (which I didn't write),
      Idon't even mention Red Hat in the article except in the list of
    Linuxdistributions and their security resources. I listed it up top
    because itseems to have the largest number of users, not because it
                                was thebest.

 <p>      I think people took it as an attack on slack because what was said
    iswildly untrue, slack may have been a pile of security holes in the
    past, idont know, as i said ive only been using it since 3.2, but i
    dont think youshould hold patrick to past mistakes, as slackware now
    is (IMHO) verystable and secure. Check out any exploit site and see
    how many exploitsthere are against slackware vs. redhat or any other
   dists, people mayargue that this doesnt prove much, but it puts me at
                                   ease.
 <p>       On a different subject, it takes a good man to admit a mistake,

  <p>    What I can't understand is how so many people who have beeninvolved
    with Unix and Linux for so long still use the termhack to refer to a
   computer break in. Machine's can gethacked, but that's usually a good
   thing. People gettinghacked? Not too sure about it, but whoever it is
   might notlike it. Hacking software, now that's something that's areal
      good thing. There are many other kinds of hacks, someof the more
    famous ones are listed at http://fishwrap.mit.edu/none of these have
   to do with computer break in.I agree though, that several distros are
   not secure to start with, and ittakes a lot of reading to secure a new
                                  system.

  <h> Oops
  <h>                   by Jon Lasser - Jan 8th 2000 14:01:16

 <p>    Yep, I did somehow manage to miss the Slackware security mailing list.
   Iswear I went to the site and looked around before claiming not tofind
               anything, but somehow I still made a mistake.

 <p>      I can't speak to the security or insecurity per se of Slackware 7,
     asI've not used it, but I'll note that most of the recent security
       holes inRed Hat and Debian (with the very notable exception of
   problems with RedHat's usermode tool -- a very, very serious problem)
     have been bugs in theunderlying code, not particularly related to
       either of those distributions.If those bugs aren't present in
     Slackware, that's either because thosepackages weren't included in
   Slackware (not a bad thing, just a point offact) or because Slackware
      fixed those bugs before anyone else knew aboutthem and failed to
           backpropogate the fixes. I don't think it's thelatter.

  <p>   In the old days (pre 7.0, maybe another level back beyond that or so,
   Ican't remember the last version I used), Slackware had hugenumbers of
   security holes. They just ignored them. And the sources neverseemed to
   be able to produce the binaries which were included -- sometimesit was
      obvious that the included sources were pre-slackware-patches, as
    thecompiler would spew errors. I certainly hope (and to some degree
   expect)that this situation's been cleaned up by now, but this made it
         impossibleto audit slackware's security if you wanted to.

 <p>       But I'm really curious as to why everyone took this as an attack
    onSlackware, specifically. It certainly wasn't intended to be that.
         Icertainly think that Slackware's record on security could
    standimprovement -- I'm more impressed with a large number of found
    and fixedbugs than an apparent lack of them in a full-featured Linux
   distribution-- but as far as I'm concerned in the article, this isn't
                     about anyparticular distribution.

  <p>    What it is about is why security is important, even if youpersonally
    can handle yourself. Claiming otherwise is kind of likeclaiming that
    ISO9660 filesystem support in Linux isn't worth keeping inthe kernel
             simply because you personally don't use it: it's a
     fundamental,enabling feature of the environment for any number of
                                   users.

  <p>       It's also about the importance of Linux's image in the media,
    andsimple things we can do to improve that image. If you personally
     don'tcare who besides yourself uses Linux, that's fine. But I need
        Linux tolook good in the media, so that I can push for it in
     appropriate projectsat work and elsewhere. Also, a good image for
   Linux in the media makes itmore attractive for companies (ie Creative
    Labs) to write open-sourcedrivers for hardware which is nice to play
                                 with. :-)

 <p>     Is it just me or does this "professional" not know what hes talking

     is the mostsecure distro, with debian coming in second and redhat

    buffer overflows and 'enabledby default' services that it is. As far
     as the security/patches/supportgo, check out slackware.com and see
   whats at the very top of the page,also slackware.com/lists. While jeff
     did make some good points and touchon some issues that need to be

 <h>  All people seem to be able to do...
   <h>                by Stephen Smoogen - Jan 8th 2000 13:30:12

  <p>      is dis other distributions versus discuss the problem. Are we so
   insecurethat we have to build a religion around what distro we use and
   why theothers are evil? Its like watching a Baptist convention talking
    about theevils of Catholics/Lutherans (and as about as worthwhile).

 <p>      Slackware 7.0 is a very big improvement over earlier versions out
    there.Patrick seems to be much more in tune with putting out things
   with the4.0/5.0/6.0 Betas than I have seen him do in years (since the
   2.x days). Idont know the reasoning behind it, but once slackware.com
    came intoexistance... the quality of the Slackware machines I dealt
   with seemed toincrease also. I dealt with too many people with hacked
   Slack95 boxes withexploits that had been around way too long. Going to
    the cdrom.com siteusually had out of date info. Now I see a central
              site and people findthings rapidly and cleanly.

   <p>     I used to use slackware up until 1996 when I switched to Red Hat
   because Iwas tired of finding exploits and the Slackware response was
   "Well patch itand compile it for yourself. We will put out a fix next
    release"... whichnever came. When I found them in Red Hat, I saw an
                           RPM at a central spot.

 <p>    Now is Red Hat perfect? NO. There are bugs and it couldalways tighten
   things up here or there. However I know every time a changeis made to
           tighten security up... there are howls of "Why did you
     changethis/that." The same is true for SuSE, Caldera, etc. You get
     slammed nomatter what you do because a) people hate change, and b)
                      people like towhine versus deal.

 <p>      Anyway back to the main point.. which is what is the problem. The
    problemis that Linux is not for System Administrators anymore!GASP!.
   Sorry most of the people who are using Linuxprobably know only enough
   system administration to start a modem and stopa modem... and that may
   be a stretch. And that is what you get for havingan open community and
     saying things like "Stop using Microsoft... usesomething better...
   also we are a community versus an elitist club likeXYZbsd, etc." (Not
     saying BSD is elitist, just a very common argument Ihear about why
                             Linux is better).

 <p>    Most people use computers as an ends to a means as JWZ said. They use
    themto browse web sites, answer email, write documents and letters,
    scanpictures in for a family album. The computer to them is nothing
      more thana tool.. as much as the car gets them to and from work.

  <p>      With this being the case, and being that we are supposed to be a
   better OSand a better community... we need to make sure that we have a
     betterattitude towards security. I dont feel boycotts are needed.
    Tools thathelp home users (not hobbyists) get working with Linuxare
                              what is needed.

    <p>                       Anyway my 2 cents of many.

  <p>      Defining security without using the word "secure" is a task into
    itself. We've all installed a linux distribution, and we've all gone
   and cleanedout inetd.conf. All of us. Everyone one of us. Think about
   it. Howmuch time and energy is wasted to clean out inetd.conf? To turn
                     offportmapper? To do all the rest?
 
 <p>  This article doesn't compare Linux security t o Microsoft security,
       itcompares it to being absolutely secured. I'd love to have a
   pre-securedLinux box, and the way this new market works, if there are
   other peoplelike me out there, we'll find a distribution that does it,
   and switch toit. Others will see our choice and begin to follow suit.
   Being "secured"and remaining useful at the same time is a thin line to
                                balance on.

  <p>      I think one of the main concepts that is missed here is that the
    average,non-expert, trying Linux because they're tired of Microsoft
   user doesn'twant a system that they have to do any real configuration
   on. They wanteverything to work, even if they have no need at all for
    the servicethey're running. You'll get users demanding that the ftp
    daemon work,only for you to find out that they're logging in to the
      machine from thesame machine, and have no real need for it to be
     running at all. Tellthem that it's a good idea to disable it, and
      they'll say that they'might' need it, and want it there. Current
   distros do seem to haveserver written all over them, but that doesn't
       really seem to be themarket they're trying to hit lately. Some
    companies don't have theresources to re-release their software every
     week. There are deadlins forpressing the CDs, writing the manuals,
    testing the software, etc.., etc. It's not always very practical to
    try to include the latest fix everyother day in the released distro.
                As for security advisories, for Calderago to

  <p>     I have to agree with jwz on monitoring for security patches. That
    should bethe job of the system administrator(s). End users have more
      importantthings to do (as far as the company is concerned) than
    monitoring patchesfor their OS. If the system administrator doesn't
   know where to look forsecurity advisories and patches, then maybe it's
         time to find a new systemadministrator. I am not a system
     administrator. I'm one of those geeks atthe company that brings in
     money on contracts. I have enough things to doat work that I don't
    need the added burden of duplicating the work of mycompany's system
              administrators (no matter how bad they may be).
 
 <p>  That being said, I also have to agree with Nicko Acks in that
   Linuxdistrobutions turn too many services on by default. Heaven forbid
   someoneshould take the better route and leave everything off to begin
   with (likeOpenBSD) and then let the system admininstrator turn on only
                           the serviceshe needs.

 <p>   Having many distros may be a plus, in some ways, but it's also
      adefinite minus too, considering that the (potential) user needs
     toconsider the pros and cons of each (or just run out and buy the
       newestversion of Red Hat like most people these days :p). And
   significant energyis wasted duplicating efforts to keep patches up to
                                   date.

 <p>      Okey, First,its not the flavor of Linux that you are ruinning, its
   theperson behind the computer. Computers don't get hacked, people do.
    IfAdmins are stupid and don't know how to secure an OS, then certain
   peoplewill take advantage of them and their computers. Second, Redhat
    is bad.Everytime a new version of Redhat comes out is because there
   are tworemote exploits for the previous version. Well, it just depends
                on theadmin, not the flavor of Linux system.

 <p>    I can not believe someone that has been in the job area for anytime
     wouldmake those assumptions about Slackware. It is by far the most
         secureflavor out there. And there are lists and sites for
    Slackwarewww.slackware.com and www.linuxmafia.org just to name two.
    When I do acomparison of changelogs I see RH has about 10+ security
    fixes and growingfast Slackware only has 2. In the 5.2 vs 4.0 we saw
      about 30vs3 . Redhat isgood mind you but should be saved for the
    workstation or webserver with nousers type install. As long as they
   try and change programs from theoriginal authors intent they will have
    this problem they taint about 40%of the apps included if you look at
   the odd ball versions they give them. Slackware on the other hand uses
    programs as is and does virtually nomodifications which always seems
    to get RH in trouble. They have thismindset that once they "brand" a
    program the user thinks its going to bebetter I this is almost never
   the case and alot of this is done by what Icall "KTWFF" Kids That Work
   For Free. As for the others Mandrake isnothing more than a modified RH
    and falls into the same catagory Debian ispretty good about security
     but also gets prone to the above but is stillmuch better. Sorry to
   flame on so much but the public is so miss-informedthat it just scares
   me sometimes and the RH jaugernaut scares me also. Ihave been in this
   biz for some years now and when I get hired for consultand I find they
   are running RH that is the first thing to go I dont knothave the time
                   to try and keep up with it. Flame off

 <h>     Slackware again
  <h>                     by elesar - Jan 8th 2000 09:56:20

  <p>      I am a bit suprised that such a "serious" guy can wrote this on
    slackware.By experience, it's the most secured linux I know. People
   before me addcomment on the mailing list, and the repository of patch.
    You can noticethere are few patches, it's because Patrick Volkerding
    has always takecare of security in his distribution of linux before
   releasing it. thereare also less packages than other ones but I sleep
                                  better.

 <p> 				  Your article is interesting, but I have the impression you only
    tellobviousness : Yes, of course, users concern by security have to
   look fortools (mailing list web page, etc ...) that give distributions
                   beforemaking a choice. It's obvious !

 <p> 		   foreverybody, even if I think it's a bit dangerous. You simply want to
             bedictator, choosing for everybody the good way...
      An another point to answer to jwz, if you can't spend half an a
   hourper day for security issues, security is definitely not a concern
   for you,sorry. I'm a bit curious, what is your model of security OS ?
      Windows ? Soyou never had a look on securityfocus (and others).
 
 <p>  I can't see how we can have security actually without spend time
                                   forit.
 
 <p>  The power of linux is in distributions, everyone can find his
     "good"distribution, so let the people of distributions works, help
    them, askthem for new features, but don't ban them. You are missing
           the real enemyand misunderstanding the open software.

   <h>     a couple of points
  <h>                   by Nicko Acks - Jan 8th 2000 07:57:56

 <p>     The bigest problem that I have found with linux distributions is the
      same problem that I have faced with many commercial unix's: they
      have too many services turned on by default that are not needed.
     One of the bigest things that would be a help for security is that
    distributions go to a policy where installed software is only turned
     on when explicitly asked for rather than on by default. While this
     will not stop everything, it would stop a good portion of the new
             machines out there getting broken into right away.

 <p> 	     One thing comes to mind. Why does every linux distribution need
     to be server oriented? I think there is a real need out there for
       a completely client-side distribution. This would take care of
       the extra services problem by making sure that servers are not
                              even an option.
 
 <p>  Another issue that I think distributions should look into is finding
     a way to more easily distribute patches. While it is a good thing
     that to have fixes come out quickly it is entire different problem
     with getting users to actually apply them. I think the process of
      fixing bugs needs to be as simple as possible so that it can be
       as automated as possible (debian's app-get method for updating
     software comes to mind). While this introduces even more possible
    security risks I think that it should be concidered at least for the
                                 new user.
 
 <p>  deffinitly a good editorial Jon...

 <p>      What you're doing is picking out one trivial error and using it as
     anexcuse to ignore the very good points he made. 

  <p>   I don't think so.. I think he should concentrate on getting people to
       choose the right distribution for their needs, not make stupid
                          inflammatory statements.

  <h> Slackware doesn't take half an hour per day to patch
  <h>                  by Bert Lindner - Jan 8th 2000 06:55:24

  <p>            Slackware security mailing list info can be found at
                          www.slackware.com/lists
      ,brought to you by David Cantrell. This has been in place since
                              October atleast.

  <p>                You can find all security patches by ftp. 
           AChangelogin that directory tells you the when, why and do-i-need-them
                            about thesepatches.

   <p>        That the author didn't look up the distro's before saying
   somethingabout them may be a trivial mistake, and I hate to go against
   jwz foranything, but it does matter for Slackware users and potential
          Slackwareusers if Slackware security is declared sloppy.

  <p>     i get at least 1 hack attempt a day. And strangely enough none of
     them seem to have worked. Why? Because i spend half an hour a day
     checking new email for problems, and checking websites for problems
     with anything i'm running. 

  <p>      It's great for you that you've got the time to do this. But for
      thevast majority of people, asking them to spend half an hour a
    dayjust looking for security fixes is completely unreasonable. If it
     takeshalf an hour a day of every user's time to keep their system
     secure, thenthere is something fundamentally wrong. That's a huge
                               amount oftime.

  <p>   Try to put yourself in the shoes of someone for whom messing withtheir
   computer is a means to an end, rather than an end in itself. Theyjust
   won't do it. They have more important things to do. Things that paythe
                                   bills.

  <p>     So if this professional sys admin has misinformed you of the
     slackware side of linux, what else could he be wrong about? I could
     be interpreting him wrong, or i might just not be thinking clearly
     tonight, 

  <p>     What you're doing is picking out one trivial error and using it as
              anexcuse to ignore the very good points he made.

 <h> no slackware security list?
  <h>                     by casphar - Jan 8th 2000 05:45:19

  <p>   I'm a home and work user of Linux, my flavour of choice is Slackware.
   I'veused most of the major distributions and am forced to use a few at
    work. As far as Slackware goes, it does have a securitymailing list
    which i am subscribed to, it can easily be found atwww.slackware.com
    which also tells you that all of the current and future versions dir
   treeswill have a patch dir, with patches for that particular version.
    I also sit on a 24/7 internet connection, with a static ip, i get at
    least1 hack attempt a day. And strangely enough none of them seem to
   haveworked. Why? Because i spend half an hour a day checking new email
     forproblems, and checking websites for problems with anything i'm
    running. So if thisprofessional sys admin has misinformed you of the
   slackware side oflinux, what else could he be wrong about? I could be
       interpreting him wrong, or imight just not be thinking clearly
     tonight, but i dont and never have hadproblems with the slackware
                               distributions.
