            <p>Charles Baxter Revisits Old Friends in Five Oaks
            Dave Weich, Powells.com 

            <p>Charles Baxter is a writer's writer. Mention his name in a crowd of 
            authors and most will voice an appreciation for at least one of his 
            books; many will simply rave. But it wasn't until Baxter's third 
            novel that large numbers of mainstream readers discovered the joys 
            of his writing. A 2001 National Book Award finalist, The Feast of 
            Love "is as precise, as empathetic, as luminous as any of Baxter's 
            past work," the New York Times cheered. "It is also rich, juicy, 
            laugh-out-loud funny and completely engrossing." 
            <p>Speaking of his past work: In the eighties and nineties, alongside a 
            pair of novels Baxter also published a book of poetry, a collection 
            of essays on writing, and four story collections. Three stories from 
            the bunch, written years apart, focused on a young married couple 
            living in Five Oaks, Michigan: Saul and Patsy. 
            <p>Who better to describe them than Saul's mother? 
              <p>They had an oddball marriage, and they both knew it. Their love 
              for each other had created a magic circle around themselves that 
              outsiders could not penetrate. No one who had ever met them knew 
              what made the two of them tick; the whole arrangement looked 
              mildly fraudulent, a Hallmark card sort of thing. Saul's mother, 
              Delia, had had an unremarkable marriage and as a still-youthful 
              widow could be gamely witty on the subject of matrimony. Her 
              opinion was that marriage was a practical economic arrangement 
              demanded by the raising of children. In her view, Saul was a 
              fanatical husband, close to unpresentable when he was around 
              Patsy. He should recognize this devotedness of his as a social 
              problem. People who stay in that kind of love once they're married 
              are a burden to others, Saul's mother intimated. They should learn 
              to tone themselves down. They don't mean to show off, but the 
              show-offing happens anyway with the gestures and the endearments 
              and the icky glances. In this regard, Saul and Patsy also 
              perplexed their other relatives and friends, who sometimes wanted 
              to know their secret and at other times just wanted to get away 
              from them, quickly. 
            <p>Does Saul and Patsy, the novel, continue the trajectory of those 
            original stories? Yes and no. Baxter explains, "The trouble was that 
            the three stories I had written about them were basically marriage 
            stories, and I didn't want to write an entire book about a 
            marriage." Instead, Baxter breaks the magic circle around his 
            central characters. What results is the author's most piercing 
            social commentary to date. 
            <p>"It is rare that a novel, even a good one, manages to evoke 
            contemporary life without being self-conscious about it," the New 
            Yorker acknowledged. "But that is what Baxter achieves here." 
            <p>A mild warning: The plot elements of Saul and Patsy discussed in 
            this interview occur in the first of the new novel's four sections. 
            Which isn't to say we don't give anything away, but only events in 
            the early going.

                  <p>by Charles Baxter 
                  "Baxter's prose – trenchant, funny, and apt to turn on a 
                  metaphysical dime – remains one of the pure pleasures of 
                  American fiction, and he deserves a wide readership for this 
                  book." James Marcus, The Atlantic Monthly

                  new novel ? a near perfect book, as deep as it is broad in its 
                  humaneness, comedy and wisdom ? when I began to worry I 
                  couldn't do it justice in a review....If there is any justice, 
                  this new novel will win him the wider fame and readership he

            <p>Dave: I was introduced to your writing eight or nine years ago when 
            I read Shadow Play. It was interesting to go back to it after 
            reading Saul and Patsy. I'd forgotten that Five Oaks, Michigan, is 
            the setting for Shadow Play, too. 
            <p>Charles Baxter: Why would you remember? 
            <p>Dave: Right. But then I went back to it, and I thought, Oh, right, 
            the chemical plant. 
            <p>Baxter: It's still there, still pumping out its particular poisons. 
            Schwartzwalder is still at work. 
            It's nice having these other books with various backgrounds to fall 
            back on. I got to a point in Saul and Patsy when I needed to think 
            of a company that was still doing business in Five Oaks, and I 
            thought, Well, WaldChem is still there. It started up in Shadow Play 
            and it's still going. 
            <p>Dave: In an interview with Tin House a few years ago, you said that 
            you didn't know whether you had the imaginative energy left to 
            finish a book about Saul and Patsy. What happened? How did you end 
            up writing this novel? 
            <p>Baxter: After The Feast of Love came out, my batteries were low. I 
            thought of going back to Saul and Patsy, about whom I had written 
            intermittently for some time the first of those stories came out 
            twenty years ago but the trouble was that the three stories I had 
            written about them were basically marriage stories, and I didn't 
            want to write an entire book about a marriage. I didn't think that 
            it would be interesting, and I didn't think I had the imaginative 
            energy to carry through on a project like that. 
            <p>What happened was that one writer, William Maxwell, who had read the 
            third story, "Saul and Patsy Are in Labor," said to me, "You know, I 
            don't think we've seen the end of Gordy Himmelman." I thought, All 
            right. I'll write another chapter with him in it and see how far I 
            can take it. I did two of those chapters or, it turned out to be 
            three of them when, rather abruptly and somewhat to my surprise, 
            Gordy killed himself. 
            <p>I don't know whether when I was talking to Tin House I was referring 
            to the problem of continuing a novel about a married couple or 
            whether I was talking about what to do after one of your major 
            characters kills himself. I spent about four months trying to figure 
            out what I was going to do after that happened. 
            <p>Every time I've finished a book, it feels to me as if the washrag 
            has been rung out. Everything that I know, everything that I've 
            observed or taken down, I've used. I feel that way now. I can't see 
            what the next book will be. I don't have an endless supply of 
            subjects. But I also think, I'm not a factory; I don't have to go 
            into mass production. Productivity in and of itself is not a good 
            thing. If there isn't another book, there's not another book. 
            <p>Dave: Going back and forth between stories and novels, does that 
            offer a release for you, to be able to change gears and work on a 
            smaller canvas after spending so much time and energy on a novel? 
            <p>Baxter: It used to. When I was a writer whose sales were respectable 
            but kind of negligible, it didn't matter whether I wrote novels or 
            stories, but then The Feast of Love sold quite a few copies. And 
            it's not that I've got this expectation directly from my editors, 
            but I think they would much prefer that I write novels. 
            <p>I think what I do next is likely to be in the realm of the short 
            story. It was always a release for me to be able to go back and 
            forth. When I had characters who were feeling impulsive and who were 
            not particularly conscious of making great plans, I'd put them into 
            stories. And I've been thinking that I want to go back to that after 
            writing this book and Feast of Love. It's about time I did another 
            book of stories. 
            <p>Dave: So you do consciously think about writing a book of stories. 
            It's not a matter of, Now I've written twelve stories and I'll 
            collect them together in a book. 
            <p>Baxter: That's the way I used to be, but when I was working on the 
            stories in Believers I was very conscious of working on a group of 
            stories that were more or less about a similar theme, that is: 
            people who are choosing to believe something or not, and whose 
            belief would change the direction of the narrative. Now I'm more 
            likely, if I write a short story, to think, What other short stories 
            could I write that would have something to do with the story I've 
            just written? I never used to think that way, but I do now. 
            <p>Dave: The Feast of Love was the first novel you wrote in 
            first-person, but you use six different voices to tell the story. 
            <p>Baxter: Right. 
            <p>Dave: They're not self-standing stories, but they are distinctly 
            different voices. In that respect, it's almost as if the novel 
            emerges from a community, a little like a collection of stories. 
            Like a chorus. 
            <p>Baxter: I was thinking about those old narrative forms: The 
            Canterbury Tales or The Decameron, the sort of forms that Calvino 
            was drawing upon in If On a Winter's Night a Traveler, a chorus of 
            voices talking about similar subjects or one subject. 
            <p>At one level, I thought, This is so literary. I don't know that I'm 
            going to get any reader to believe. It's assumed that there's this 
            guy Charlie who has insomnia and is wandering around Ann Arbor 
            collecting stories about love from people he knows. It's 
            preposterous in a way because people won't talk about their love 
            lives most of the time to anybody, much less to someone they hardly 
            know. But it was a way of writing a novel using different stories. 
            <p>I love to break up the big arc with a lot of little arcs. I'm very 
            comfortable doing that. The standard novel form doesn't interest me 
            very much, the one that goes from A in a smooth arc full of suspense 
            to its ending. I just don't care about books like that very much. 
            I'm really interested in jazzing the form somehow, making readers 
            think they actually don't know where the story is going. 
            <p>The Feast of Love is a kind of hybrid: a novel that is made up of a 
            lot of little stories, mosaics that create a larger narrative. Even 
            Shadow Play is like that. It's a very episodic book. 
            <p>Dave: In much of your fiction, certainly in Saul and Patsy, we'll 
            see the same scene described from two different points of view, one 
            after the other. One moment we're experiencing the scene with Saul, 
            then you rewind and we're with Patsy. The narratives overlap. 
            I would imagine that develops in a later draft once you've worked 
            out what's happening and now it's a matter of figuring out where to 
            put the cameras. 
            <p>Baxter: That's something that I've done for a long time. There are 
            double-narrated scenes in First Light, and that book came out in 
            1987. 
            <p>There's something about revisiting scenes from different points of 
            view that I've always liked. It's given me the opportunity to do a 
            Rashomon approach to narrative: everything depends on who's seeing 
            it and from what angle. 
            <p>I guess that arises in revisions and subsequent drafts, but it's so 
            hard for me to reconstruct the writing of a book after I've written 
            it that I couldn't actually tell you when I thought of, for example, 
            Patsy arriving at home when Howie is in the living room; she's 
            carrying Emmy and she's thinking, We've got to get out of this 
            place. I have absolutely no recollection of how I decided or why I 
            decided to do that particular scene twice. I just felt it was 
            particularly important to do the scene from her point of view when 
            she comes in the door and sees Howie and also to do it from Saul's 
            point of view, when he's trying to deal with Howie and suddenly 
            Patsy comes in. 
            <p>Dave: Salman Rushdie was here about a year ago. We got to talking 
            about what he called his "language project," how his writing style 
            and interests have evolved. When he sits down to write now he has 
            different objectives. 
            <p>Do you see an evolution in your own work, in your fiction? How would 
            you say that your vision has changed? 
            <p>Baxter: I think it's getting darker. I've been surprised by some of 
            the commentary about Saul and Patsy, as if it's this sun-drenched 
            novel about a marriage because that was not the book I thought I was 
            writing. 
            <p>I don't think too much about what it is that I'm doing, though. I 
            don't think that's necessarily very good for writers. You can talk 
            about what you're interested in and the kinds of people that you're 
            watching, the cluster of behaviors they're involved in; and as you 
            get older, because you're aging, you're beginning to look at 
            different things; because you're looking at different things, you're 
            bound to become a different writer. But it's not as if it's willful 
            for me. It's not an act of will. I don't say, Now I will write about 
            the fate of the entrepreneur in America because it needs to be 
            studied. I don't work that way. It's much more a matter of thinking 
            that I need to write about this group of people whom I've been 
            watching or whose behavior interests me. 
            <p>I said half-facetiously to a reporter at the New York Times that 
            I've gotten interested in psychopaths lately. And I got a horrified 
            phone call from a writer friend of mine saying, "You're not 
            serious." I said, "Well, no. They didn't get my tone." But I was 
            serious, actually. I just don't let the will direct things. It's a 
            matter of what I'm drawn to next. 
            <p>Dave: Well, for example, how did you come to write The Feast of Love 
            in the first-person instead of using the third-person, as you had in 
            your previous novels? 
            <p>Baxter: It was partly that I had seen my son in a production of A 
            Midsummer Night's Dream, and I had the idea that if I was going to 
            tell a love story, if I was going to write a book on that subject, 
            it was important to get it in the voices of the people who were 
            experiencing it. Like a play or, this time, a hybrid of a novel and 
            a play. 
            <p>I wanted to get the energy of colloquial language into it more 
            directly than I would have been able to if I had done it even in a 
            close third-person. So I decided just to try it and see how far I 
            could get with it. 
            <p>I started with Bradley. He was a hard character to get moving, but 
            once Chloe came on the scene, I thought, Maybe this is going to 
            work. That's why I did it. Mostly the energy. Just the energy of 
            spoken discourse. 
            <p>Dave: There's a quote from you on the back of Julie Orringer's book, 
            How to Breathe Underwater, where you talk about the energy of her 
            stories. I haven't been reading many story collections lately, in 
            part for reasons you alluded to earlier: story collections don't 
            have the marketability of novels; or, another way to put it is that 
            the people who visit Powells.com aren't likely to care as much about 
            a new story collection as they might a new novel. But I completely 
            fell into Orringer's book. And I think you put your finger on the 
            reason: It was something about the energy, the way the stories 
            propel you forward. Where does that energy come from? 
            <p>Baxter: This is a dumb way to answer it, but first of all it has to 
            come from the writer; the writer has to feel it. But where does the 
            writer get it? 
            <p>There are a couple explanations, both really contingent, but you can 
            argue that when a short story writer really makes a mark Grace 
            Paley, Ray Carver, people who can write stories and almost can't 
            write anything else it's because they've discovered a certain class 
            of character and the way those characters sound that really fills 
            the gas tank and gets the thing moving. Grace Paley's stories don't 
            sound like anybody else's. Carver's didn't either. You felt when you 
            were reading those stories that you were discovering a certain class 
            of people: Carver's working class people who shop at Kmart and drink 
            too much and are kind of going crazy over the weekends. So there's 
            that. 
            <p>There's also the sense of people who are really acting impulsively. 
            That's what I think short stories are really good at. There's more 
            impulsive behavior in short story collections. There's a lot of 
            energy derived from observing people who aren't thinking about what 
            they're doing. Julie's book has a lot of that, a lot of those 
            characters. 
            <p>I included one of her stories in Best New American Voices 2001, and 
            in the introduction I said, "If you start reading this story it's 
            almost impossible to stop because it's about young people who are 
            just acting out one thing after another." I think that's where the 
            energy comes from. 
            <p>Dave: Have you recently read anything so good that it made you want 
            to rush over to the table and start writing? 
            <p>Baxter: That doesn't happen to me often anymore, but my former 
            student, Michael Byers, wrote a beautiful book called Long for This 
            World. I was going around button-holing people, saying, "You should 
            read this book." I was buying copies of it because I thought it was 
            so good. 
            <p>A few months ago, by chance, I read Jenny Egan's book, Look at Me. I 
            think that's an amazingly good book about a lot of different things. 
            And those things that it happens to be about are important in the 
            society that we seem to be building for ourselves. Have you read it? 

            <p>Dave: I haven't. 
            <p>Baxter: It's really, really good. 
            <p>Siri Hustvedt's What I Loved is a very interesting book also. I 
            still have these enthusiasms. Sometimes I'm reading books by my 
            contemporaries or my former students out of sense of dutifulness, 
            but sometimes it really blossoms into a big enthusiasm. 
            <p>I noticed that Edward P. Jones has published a new novel [The Known 
            World]. He is one of the best still-to-be-discovered writers in 
            America. His book of stories, Lost in the City, is a great book. 
            Imagine an African American Kafka. Imagine black people in 
            Washington D.C. how Kafka might have seen them, caught up in various 
            bureaucracies, and you'd have a sense of that book. I think it's 
            just been reprinted now that his novel is out. That's a book I've 
            recommended to a lot of people and they're just amazed when they 
            read it. 
            <p>Dave: As we were walking up the stairs you mentioned that you've 
            written an essay for The Believer about the fact that novelists no 
            longer describe their characters' faces. Can you expand upon that? 
            <p>Baxter: If you're reading a novel by Dickens or Austen or Thomas 
            Hardy, when a new character comes on, the character's face is going 
            to be described and it's going to be used as an indication of what 
            that person's character is like. In the twentieth century, it's very 
            rare for writers to do that except when they have really grotesque 
            characters they want to show you: Flannery O'Connor, William 
            Faulkner, Richard Wright? The characters that really get described 
            are the ones that really look strange. 
            <p>One of the last writers in North America who believes in a 
            description of a character's face as an index to character is Saul 
            Bellow. And in this essay I've spent part of the spring putting 
            together I was trying to figure out why. Why doesn't anybody do this 
            anymore? 
            <p>People still describe facial reactions, but that's not quite the 
            same thing. Paula Fox is great at facial reactions. In a book like 
            The Widow's Children you always know how people are reacting to 
            everybody else, but that's not as if you're going to get a sense of 
            who they are. 
            <p>I just got interested. And I started to think, given our recent 
            political history: Whose faces we are being invited to look at and 
            whose faces don't we see? I was really interested during the war how 
            we weren't getting casualty counts of the Iraqis and how the 
            photographs of the Iraqi population often showed people shouting and 
            angry. 
            <p>All of my essays come out of obsessions. They come out of nowhere, 
            why I'm thinking these things. 
            <p>Dave: I had fun reading through Burning Down the House. I was 
            intrigued by the idea of not being afraid to overstate your case. 
            You explain in the introduction, "The reader may notice that one of 
            the means I employed to create such excitement was the wild claim. 
            There are a number of wild claims here, an occasional manic swing 
            toward the large statement." 
            <p>We're featuring a new collection by Lester Bangs [Main Lines, Blood 
            Feasts, and Bad Taste], and reading Burning Down the House reminded 
            of something Greil Marcus said about Bangs's writing: "Lester was 
            very, very good at not censoring himself. That's one of the hardest 
            things for a writer: to figure out what you really want to say, then 
            to say it not to say what will sound good and will reflect well on 
            you." 
            <p>Baxter: Gertrude Stein called this "the excitement of 
            unsubstantiated generalities." When I was writing that book I just 
            gave myself permission to say what I wanted to say. If the 
            generalization seemed big, well, so what? It's my book. I thought I 
            could say what I wanted to. If you disagree with me, or if you think 
            I'm crazy or silly, all right. 
            <p>I was trying to get some excitement back into literary criticism. 
            There are books like Robert Hass's Twentieth Century Pleasures, a 
            book of essays about twentieth century poetry, that had that same 
            excitement for me. And I thought, I want to do something like that 
            for fiction. 
            <p>People sometimes get upset. I haven't heard the last of that 
            "Against Epiphanies" essay or the one about dysfunctional 
            narratives, "Mistakes Were Made." But with "Mistakes Were Made," I 
            really felt I was on to something. I was watching Cheney yesterday 
            on Face the Nation: complete disavowal of responsibility for all bad 
            outcomes. 
            <p>Dave: Politically, that's the norm today. The funny thing about 
            reading "Mistakes Were Made" now is that you cite Nixon and Reagan 
            and the first Bush. All of them, of course, begot Clinton. 
            <p>Baxter: Right, right. We were just on the frontier of disavowals in 
            those days. We hadn't seen anything compared to what we've gotten. 
            It's amazing. 
            <p>Dave: It's a bit unsettling to read that essay and, in retrospect, 
            think, Well, yeah. 
            <p>Baxter: Yeah. Stating the obvious. When the essay came out, it 
            created a little bit of a stir. People had talked about 
            dysfunctional narratives, but they hadn't actually tied this feature 
            of victim literature to certain features of political rhetoric we 
            were getting. I think maybe that was new. 
            <p>Dave: The other essay you mentioned, "Against Epiphanies," I found 
            interesting in the context of Saul and Patsy. One of the things that 
            I found endearing about Saul is that he has epiphanies throughout 
            the course of the book, but he knows they're not going to last. So 
            they're not epiphanies in the traditional sense, but more like 
            moments of ecstasy. 
            <p>Baxter: They're not eternal verities; they're not going to last. 
            <p>I had my little joke on the epiphanic moment when I was working on 
            the second one of those stories, "Saul and Patsy Are Pregnant." At 
            the end of that story, Saul grasps the entire secret of the 
            universe, the meaning of everything, and he promptly forgets it. It 
            doesn't get into the story. It's not an epiphany; it's about the 
            feeling of understanding everything. It's just a feeling. Oh, yeah, 
            that's what it is. 
           <p>Dave: You've been doing interviews for a long time now. Is there 
            something you're fascinated by that everyone seems to be missing? 
            <p>Baxter: People in the book business, people who are in your 
            position, are usually pretty smart. They've usually read what I've 
            written fairly carefully. The only thing that's caught me at all by 
            surprise lately, with this book, is that there have been a number of 
            commentaries that have said that it's a marriage novel, it's about 
            these Midwesterners, it's about innocence, it's about this 
            essentially good couple? 
<p>What I thought I was writing about was the sense of being excluded 
            from happiness. That's what I think this book is about. Saul feels 
            as soon as the third chapter that the McPhees are living in this 
            state of happiness and he has to stand outside of it, like the 
            beggar at the bakery shop window. That whole sense of exclusion gets 
            repeated with Gordy, who stands outside Saul and Patsy's house, 
            looking inside. Then there's this whole army of kids who seem to 
            have been deprived entry into the world that maybe somebody had 
            suggested to them they might someday live in. 
            <p>That's really the only thing that nobody ever asks me about. It's 
            always seemed to me that a lot of my work has to do with somebody 
            watching somebody else who is happy. For me, stories begin with a 
            kind of displacement; they're not about people who are happy, but 
            about the people who are watching others be happy and trying to 
            figure out how to get there or what it was that those other people 
            did to arrive in that state. It's all over my writing.
