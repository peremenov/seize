                  <h>STUDENT CONSERVATION TIPS
                  <p>Below is list of fun conservation ideas and projects that you, 
                  your family, friends, and teachers can enjoy!
                  <h>NATURE
                    <p>Identify as many species of birds as possible in the local 
                    park near your school. Call your local paper with the 
                    information, citing it as a good nature story for the 
                    community. 
                    <p>Conduct a photography contest at your school focusing on 
                    animals. Ask a local newspaper photographer to judge. 
                    <p>Develop a nature themed bulletin board at your school. 
                    <p>Arrange for a school poster contest with an environmental or 
                    wildlife theme. 
                    <p>Make a bird feeder. Use various shapes and seed types to 
                    attract different species.  Keep a journal so you can 
                    identify feeding patterns as they emerge. 
                    <p>Study animals classified as endangered species; collect 
                    pictures of them; study them; discuss why they are 
                    endangered and what can be done to help save them. 
                    <p>Leaf collection - Collect as many leaves as possible. 
                    Identify them; trace them; make a collage. How many 
                    different species of trees are in your area? Make an album 
                    by putting leaves in a plastic photo album and labeling 
                    them. 
                
                  <h>RECYCLING AND WASTE REDUCTION 
                    <p>Become an Environmental Shopper: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, 
                    Reject and React.  Learn how to use your dollars to protect 
                    the environment. 
                    <p>Start a composting pile at your school. 
                    <p>Make a worm bin to dispose of your garbage. 
                    <p>Conduct a waste audit at your school. Find out what can be 
                    recycled, what is being recycled and what more can be 
                    recycled. 
                    <p>Lobby your school board to buy products made from recycled 
                    materials (e.g. Recycled copier paper). 
                    <p>If you do not have curbside collection for recyclables in 
                    your community, campaign to have drop-off areas designated. 
                    <p>Organize a "Take the Pledge Not to Litter" campaign in your 
                    school to reduce litter. 
                    <p>Work with your local business community to provide 
                    attractive litter and recycling containers.   Obtain 
                    merchants' agreement to empty the containers with their 
                    trash or recyclables. 
                    <p>Become a litter basket for a day. Attach a brown bag to your 
                    clothing and collect any litter you encounter at your 
                    school.   At the end of the day, put on a pair of gloves to 
                    examine the litter. Decide what can be recycled, composted, 
                    trashed or eliminated. (Caution children not to pick up 
                    unusual looking or hazardous waste.) 
               
                  <h>GENERAL ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 
                    <p>Contact your local library; ask the librarian to run a free 
                    slide or movie presentation on an environmental subject. 
                    <p>Arrange a visit to your local sewage treatment plant to 
                    increase your knowledge of how sewage is treated. 
                    <p>Plant a vegetable garden using old egg cartons to start your 
                    seeds. 
                    <p>Investigate if businesses and industries in your area have 
                    an environmental policy. 
                    <p>lnvite your school custodial staff to speak about the 
                    cleaning products they use. Try to find substitutes to 
                    replace those your research identifies as toxic or 
                    hazardous. 
                    <p>Develop an environmental newsletter for your school. 
                    <p>Find out how water pollution affects us. Have the children 
                    pour an inch of red food coloring into a glass. Then have 
                    them pour one inch of water into the glass. Stand a stalk of 
                    celery or a white flower into the glass. Let it stand 
                    overnight to see how the plant has absorbed the red water. 
                    Polluted water is absorbed in plants the same way. Discuss 
                    with the children how we can reduce the amount of pollutants 
                    getting into our plants and eventually to us. (e.g. Stop 
                    using chemical fertilizers. ) 
                    <p>Make a Mini-Landfill. Fill a pair of women's pantyhose with 
                    the following items: 
                    a foam egg carton, empty tin can, empty glass bottle, piece 
                    of newspaper, an apple core, chewed stick of gum, a piece of 
                    natural fiber, a plant clipping, and a plastic straw. Bury 
                    the filled pantyhose at least 8' deep, away from saturated 
                    soils. Mark the spot. After three months have passed, dig up 
                    the pantyhose from the ground and remove the contents 
                    carefully. Observe which materials have begun to biodegrade. 
                    Discuss with the children why this has happened. 
                    <p>Candleholders From Plastic Soda Bottles -  Have an adult cut 
                    the top off a 2-liter soda bottle (approximately six inches 
                    down). Trim the edges with a sharp pair of scissors. Make 
                    sure that the edge is even all around. Have the children 
                    decorate the holders by gluing various items to the holders 
                    (e.g. Use leftover scraps of paper or materials). Complete 
                    the project by adding a candle. 
                    <p>Soda Bottle Terrarium - Have an adult remove the neck of a 
                    2-liter plastic soda bottle (hint - use the bottoms of the 
                    bottles used in #5 above). Cut the bottle with a knife.   
                    Remove the label and the black plastic bottom. Place the 
                    bottle in hot water to remove the bottom more easily. Fill 
                    the black bottom with potting soil and place plants, rocks 
                    and figures into the soil. Water thoroughly. Take the clear 
                    plastic body of the bottle, turn it up side down and slide 
                    it into the black bottom, making a dome for the terrarium. 
                 
                  <h>COMMUNITY IMPROVEMENT 
                  BEAUTY, LITTER, ACTIVISM 
                    <p>Participate in PRC's “Lens on Litter” photo contest. Submit 
                    photographs of the worst littered areas in your community to 
                    win prizes. 
                    <p>Find out if any of your local parks have nature trails. If 
                    they don't, contact your local park board to help establish 
                    one. 
                    Write letters to companies that use too much packaging. 
                    <p>Study the voting records of elected officials (found in your 
                    local paper) to see how they vote on environmental issues. 
                    Write letters praising those with good records and urging 
                    those with poor records to do better. 
                    <p>Organize a safe clean-up of school grounds or other 
                    community sites; recycle the recyclables you collect. 
                    <p>Plant deciduous trees at your school. 
                    <p>Plant a wildflower garden. 
                  
                  <h>ENERGY AND WATER CONSERVATION 
                    <p>Ask your school's utility company to do an energy audit of 
                    your school. 
                    <p>Learn about conservation. Contact your local conservation 
                    district (water/soil) and find out what conservation 
                    practices are used in your locale. 
                    <p>Help your school develop a plan to replace existing 
                    incandescent lighting with energy-saving bulbs and fixtures.
