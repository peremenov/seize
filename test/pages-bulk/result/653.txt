      <h>Squirrel Counting 
       <p>Add fun to your early childhood counting curriculum with this preschool 
      activity by Jana M. 
       <p>Materials: Small dixie cups , squirrel pattern and nuts.  
       <p>Description: Teachers take a squirrel pattern and staple it to dixie cups. 
      Write a number on each squirrel.  Now, have the child count out how many 
      nuts they need for that squirrel.  Have a different number on each 
      squirrel. You can also have the child take nuts away from the squirrel, to 
      see how many he has left. 
       <p>Comments: Some  three's I find are not quite ready for this. I find that 
      by the end of the year they're doing it much better.

      <h>Year 'Round "Seasonal Tree" 
       <p>Share the ideas of the changing season with children just as Terry H. 
      does. 
       <p>Materials: Large paper cut out of a tree with bare limbs. 
       <p>Summer - - green leaves 
       <p>Fall - - colored leaves 
       <p>Winter - - Misc. items to be hung on tree (snowmen, mittens, hearts, 
      Easter eggs) 
       <p>Spring - - green leaves 
       <p>Construction paper and tape. 
       <p>Description: We place a large brown tree with bare limbs  on a vacant 
      wall.  We begin the school year with green leaves on this tree. Teachers 
      can put children's name on individual leaves. The children enjoy seeing 
      their names placed around the room. I generally put flowers at the base of 
      the tree and a sunshine could be put up over the tree. 
      <h>FALL:  
	   <p>Gradually start changing the green leaves to fall colored leaves.  
      Once they have all changed, have them begin to "fall to the ground" until 
      the tree is bare.  We make pumpkins to put under the tree to replace the 
      flowers and at halloween time add faces to these pumpkins. 
      <h>WINTER:  
	   <p>Explaining the seasons to the children, we tell them about summer 
      and fall.  Since our tree is now without leaves, during the winter we will 
      add our own "special" things to the tree. We make: 
             <p>Snowmen in December 
            Mittens in January 
            Hearts in February 
            Easter Eggs in March.
       <p>Then the leaves begin to reappear for the spring. 
       <p>New for this year, we're adding apple blossoms (made from tissue paper) to 
      the tree in September and then change those blossoms to apples. Showing it 
      as a fall apple tree  (before we do the color change on the leaves). 
       <p>Comments: This was a new idea for last year. We are going to use it this 
      year to really discuss the changing seasons and also incorporate our apple 
      lessons.

       <h>Color Song:  Leaves on the Trees 
       <p>During this Autumn activity preschool children stand in a circle, sing 
      this song and perform actions to the tune of "The Wheels on The Bus". 
         <p>The leaves on the trees come tumbling down, 
        Tumbling down, tumbling down. 
        (Children flutter their hands and fingers down to the floor each time 
        the phrase 'tumbling down' is repeated) 
         <p>The leaves on the trees come tumbling down, 
        All over town. 
        (Children flutter hands down, then turn around) 
         <p>The leaves on the trees are red red red, 
        Red red red, red red red, 
        (Everyone wearing red clothes goes to the middle of the circle and 
        shakes themselves) 
        The leaves on the trees are red red red, 
        All over town. 
         <p>The leaves on the trees are green green green, 
        Green green green, green green green. 
        (Everyone wearing green goes to the middle of the circle and shakes) 
         <p>The leaves on the trees are green green green, 
        All over town. 
         <p>Repeat for orange and yellow leaves
       <p>Lots of Color Activities are in the Rainbow Resource Room. 
      <h>Leaf Classification Bar Graph 
       <p>This preschool education lesson plan begins outdoors, takes advantage of 
      Autumn's colors and encourages young children's classification and sorting 
      skills as they work with concrete materials and compare amounts. 
       <p>You will need: 
      Enough large paper bags for half the children in your group, tape, 
      glue/glue stick, craft paper and a felt tip marker  
       <p>In advance explain to preschool children that they will collect fallen 
      leaves.  Remind children not to put leaves off plants, bushes or trees.  
      Only collect the leaves that have fallen on the ground.  Encourage young 
      children to use the "buddy system" when collecting (two preschoolers share 
      each collection paper bag).  As the children collect leaves teachers use 
      descriptive words, "I see you've found 3 orange leaves" etc. 
       <p>Back inside the preschool classroom, during small group time, sort the 
      leaves according to color, size or kind.  Together with young children 
      count how many of each color, size or kind.  Are there more brown leaves 
      than green leaves? 
       <p>Creating a vertical bar graph will help children compare the leaves 
      according to a classification category such as color etc. On craft paper 
      teachers list the leaf colors.  Next ask children to tape or glue leaves 
      in the appropriate color column.  Display on children's eye level and 
      refer to the bar graph often during the fall season.
