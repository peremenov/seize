      <h>Updated: February 16, 2006 Book Review: Sharpening Your SAS Skills by 
      Sunil Gupta and Curt Edmonds
       <p>Book Review: Sharpening Your SAS Skills by Sunil Gupta and Curt Edmonds
      Chapman & Hall/CRC Press: ISBN: 1584885017
      This book is worth reading by all levels of SAS programmers but especially 
      for the Beginner up to the Intermediate Levels. You should have some 
      experience using the SAS software before picking up this book. It provides 
      concise explanations, helpful examples and a nice summary section at the 
      end of all six chapters with the added benefit of some comprehensive 
      questions with answers provided at the end of the book.
      Another added feature of this book for those who have not used SAS V9 or 
      V8, is a section on the enhancements to these two SAS versions which 
      should be helpful to those who have not had much experience with the new 
      enhancements.
       <p>In reading this book, I uncovered a few new features of SAS that I was 
      unaware of and immediately thought of where I could utilize these new 
      features and began employing them in my new code. This book is NOT 
      intended to be a reference manual but the 273 pages can easily be read 
      over several days and is helpful as a refresher course to reinforce your 
      basic knowledge of SAS. It also provides a great presentation and 
      explanation on the PDV which I have not found in other books by SAS users. 
      This is a book worth having in your SAS library to share with the rest of 
      your staff who use the SAS Software.
