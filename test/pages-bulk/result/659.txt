<p>Madam Deputy Speaker (Sylvia Heal): Order. I remind hon. Members that
   Mr. Speaker has imposed a 12-minute limit on Back-Bench speeches.

<h>2.31 pm

<p>Sir Teddy Taylor (Rochford and Southend, East) (Con): As the
   indications are that we are likely to have an election soon, I thought
   that there would be no harm in using the Easter Adjournment debate to place on record a number of
   issues that we should pay attention to in the new Parliament and
   perhaps in the forthcoming election.

<p>Five things concern me and I hope that people will think seriously
   about them. The first and most obvious one concerns where I used to
   come from, Scotland, where we have the problem of devolution. We
   hardly ever talk about devolution but it has a horrendous cost for
   Scotland, Wales and London. The least we should do, bearing in mind
   the fact that there has been a huge change of opinion on devolution
   since it was introduced, is to give the people of Scotland, Wales and
   London the opportunity to say whether they wish their devolved
   Parliaments and Assemblies to continue.

<p>I visit Wales, which is a lovely place. I also visit Scotland a great
   deal. I am certainly of the opinion that there has been a huge change
   of opinion. People feel that they have far too many politicians, that
   it is costing far too much and that something should be done. What
   worries me as we face the election is that I cannot identify a single
   party that says that the people of Scotland, Wales and London should
   have the opportunity to say whether they wish their devolved
   government to continue. We should give them such a chance, and I hope
   that whoever wins the election will make that clear.

<p>The second problem is that of asylum seekers. It is a frightening
   problem. In some areas, because people have the impression, perhaps
   wrongly, that the Government have lost control of the asylum seeker
   problem, we find that race relations are deteriorating, which is bad
   for communities and for the country as a whole. I am glad to say that,
   in Southend, where I reside, we have good community relations, but in
   other parts of the country people feel that things are going wrong and
   that something should be done. The greatest danger of all is if the
   parties start shouting at each other about who is to blame for the
   problem. We should be looking at the real problem and seeing what can
   be done.

<p>The Minister for Citizenship and Immigration, who is one of the most
   agreeable politicians I have come across, answered a question just
   last week that I put to him, asking how many people were told last
   year that they had to leave the country. The answer was 64,000. I then
   asked him how many had left and the answer as 4,000. That is not
   because of the inefficiency or incapacity of the Government. It is
   simply because of the basic problem that asylum seekers who come here
   have a habit of destroying their passports and all their papers. So
   when the Government say that they have to go back to their own
   country, their own country says that it does not want them because
   they do not have any papers or any proof of who they are.

<p>I know that those figures are exact, because I was given them by the
   Minister. I have been told by others, although it has not been
   confirmed, that there are actually 250,000 people in Britain today who
   have no right to remain here and who should be back in their own
   countries. We certainly should show the utmost appreciation and help
   to people who are being persecuted, but when we have that massive
   number of people and nothing can apparently be done because of the
   problem of the absence of papers, we should face up to that. The most
   obvious thing is to have some initiative, taken perhaps by the United
   Nations, so that when someone comes to our country from another country claiming
   asylum, there is a document that will enable them to be sent back if
   the Government decide that they should be.

<p>If we do not face up to that, we will have the problem of a large
   number of people in this country who no longer have the right to
   benefits and who will look to other places to get money. It will not
   be good for anything, and I hope that the issue will be faced up to no
   matter who wins the election.

<p>The third problem that we have to face up to is that of the European
   Union. It has haunted me for 25 of the 40 years that I have been here.
   What worries me immensely is the way in which democracy is being
   fundamentally undermined because of our membership of the European
   Union. When I came here, the MPs or the Lords decided all the taxes we
   had. Basically, the European Union is taking more and more power and
   the people's views are utterly irrelevant.

<p>We sometimes forget that a good democracy depends on the people having
   a view and being able to express an    opinion. For example, when a
   Conservative Government brought in a poll tax that people did not
   like, they were able to reject the Government and to get that changed.
   The people had power, but the number of people taking part in
   elections now is simply fading away, because a lot of them feel that
   there is little point in voting.

<p>I had the pleasure of speaking to a lovely group of school children
   from London who were being shown around here. There were 70 of them
   aged 17. They were delightful. I talked to them about the political
   system and how it worked here. Then we talked about politics. It was
   quite disturbing. Seven of them told me that they thought we had a
   dreadful Government. They thought that the Prime Minister was a
   rascal, that the war in Iraq was shameful and that public services had
   gone to pot. That rather cheered me up as a Conservative. Then they
   talked about the Conservatives. They did not say a nasty thing about
   them. There was no capitalist pig stuff or anything like that. They
   just thought that they were totally irrelevant and they had no views
   on them at all. They then talked about Liberal Democrats. The only
   opinion expressed was that they were slightly nicer people but they
   had no policies.

<p>I then asked those youngsters, "How are you going to vote at the next
   election? You will have to decide if democracy is going to continue."
   We had a poll. I asked how many were going to vote Labour and the
   answer was none; how many were going to vote Conservative and the
   answer was none; how many were going to vote Lib Dem and the answer
   was one out of 70. Although that may appear to be a victory to some
   degree for the Liberal Democrats, what should worry us is the number
   of young people who are simply switching off.

<p>I went to the university of Aberdeen to speak to a meeting of
   300 young people. It was beautiful and very exciting for me but what
   appalled me was that, when I asked, "How many of you are involved in
   politics?" the answer was: one out of 300. When I was at university,
   everyone was involved in a party or movement of some sort. The fact is
   that young people are switching off and the number of people voting is
   going down.

<p>Why is that happening? It is happening because people can no longer
   express an opinion about the things that they care about. Take a basic
   issue of the old days like capital punishment or corporal punishment.
   We can no longer determine that because of the European convention.
   The treaty will confirm that if it comes in. The same applies even to
   things such as the export of live cattle. A group of five people
   recently called at my surgery, including a clergyman who brought a dog
   with him to show that he was fond of animals. The group asked me
   whether I would vote against the export of live cattle. I had to say
   that I was sorry, but there was nothing we could do about that. They
   asked whether they could go to their European MP. I told them not to
   waste their time, because if the European Parliament closed its doors
   tomorrow, nobody would notice apart from the taxi drivers of
   Strasbourg. They then asked me where they could go.

<p>Similarly, some of my pensioner constituents asked me whether it was
   really true that the Government had been told that we had to pay the
   heating allowance to people in the overseas territories of Europe. I
   had to explain that, yes, we had to pay it to people living in
   Guadeloupe, Martinique or the Azores, where there is sunshine all the
   time, but that people living in Iceland or northern Canada, where it
   is cold, do not get it. They asked, "Why don't you do something about
   that as an MP?" The answer, of course, is that we have no power at all
   over such matters.

<p>Some time ago, we had a debate about the age of homosexual consent--a
   big, vital issue--but it was pointless, because the European Court of
   Justice had decided on the matter 18 months before. There is a basic
   problem in Europe because of the destruction of democracy. The big
   problem ahead, which I hope people will think about and which has
   nothing to do with party politics, is what is happening to Europe's
   population. The United Nations has calculated that if trends do not
   change, the number of people living in Europe in 50 years' time will
   have declined by 100 million because of the way in which population
   numbers are going. We see that in Scotland more readily than
   elsewhere, and we see it throughout Europe. We will have a shrinking
   tax base, more demand for health care and pensions, lower inward
   investment and, frankly, heightening social tensions, given the number
   of people coming into these countries. It is a frightening situation
   and we have to ask whether Europe has the ability, without democracy,
   to resolve the problem.

<p>In Southend-on-Sea, we worry about a fourth issue--the Government's
   ability to ensure that things done by organisations can be questioned.
   We have had a bit of a nightmare over the rates issue. In Southend,
   there was a relatively low increase--although it was an increase--of
   4 per cent., but unfortunately we have had to cut back on public
   services because it has been calculated that the population has
   reduced from 180,000 to 162,000. However, as someone who lives in
   Southend, I can say that there has been no reduction in our population
   at all. The numbers attending local general practitioners' surgeries
   have increased, the number of houses has increased and our schools are
   busier than ever; and we think that the calculation is completely
   wrong. But what can we do about the situation? Home Office Ministers
   say, "It's nothing to do with us". Such issues must be resolved; if we
   cannot sort out problems, we will not sort out anything at all.

<p>My last point concerns the Iraq war. I have often been in a minority
   in the House of Commons, unfortunately at times, although I find that
   opinions seem to change in my direction. I was one of those who
   opposed the Iraq war because I thought it pure hypocrisy on the part
   of the Americans, who, having supported Saddam Hussein and given him
   all the weapons of mass destruction for the invasion of Iran, then
   turned against him. The Government now have a terrible problem,
   although I do not mean to be unkind, as it will apply to all
   Governments in future. The statement that we heard today concerning
   the lady who resigned from a Government post and whose letter was not
   published suggests that faith in the Government is declining.

<p>I have three children, one of whom is in the Army and was out in Iraq.
   I can tell the House that it is frightening for any parent to be in
   that position. I would say this to the Government: in this situation,
   where lives are being lost in the services, and Americans and the
   Iraqis themselves are suffering in huge numbers, the least that they
   could do is to explain the whole situation to the public and tell them
   the whole truth. Frankly, it is not enough for us to shout across the
   Chamber at each other about who is to blame; particularly when lives
   are at stake, we should do all that we can to tell the truth.

<p>The crucial issue is what will happen in the future. I believe that in
   Iraq we have created an horrendous mess that will be difficult to
   resolve. Having been misled on Iraq, I hope that the Government will
   not make the same mistake on Iran, which is a country with many
   positive aspects that we should face up to.

<p>Madam Deputy Speaker, you were kind to call me early in the debate; I
   appreciate that very much. I hope that Members of the House will think
   about the points that I have made; it is just possible that I might be
   right.
