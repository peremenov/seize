 <h>                   Teaching Diversity: A Lifelong Journey

 <h>   Antoinette Halsell Miranda, Ph. D.
 <h>   Associate Professor of Counselor Education, Rehabilitation Services,
    andSchool Psychology
    College of Education

 <p>   When I came to OSU in 1988, I was asked to develop a multicultural
   education course. I was delighted to have the opportunity to create a
   course about a topic for which I had great passion and commitment.
   What has evolved is a 15-year journey of preparing education personnel
   and others to understand and appreciate an increasingly diverse world
   with the goal of creating cross-culturally competent individuals.

 <p>    Using my own experience as a starting point, I developed a course that
   included those elements that I believed to be important in helping me
   become cross-culturally competent. The goal of the course was to
   provide graduate students with an awareness and knowledge of cultural
   diversity with a major aspect being self-exploration. I have learned
   from my students over the years and they have helped shape the
   development of the course as well as myself as an instructor. By no
   means am I the expert on how to deliver diversity classes, but I will
   share what I have found to work for me.

  <h>   Instructor as Facilitator

 <p>    First, I have come to view myself as a facilitator in this course. I
   believe it is critical for the facilitator to set the tone of the
   class. Thus, my first goal in the class is to develop a community of
   learners who respect what others say while recognizing that "we" all
   have some ethnocentric viewpoints. One persons reality does not define
   another's. I try to assist students in understanding that past
   experiences influence how we view the world, which often leads to
   differences in how people interpret diversity issues. On the first day
   of class, I set ground rules. These include: 1) sharing the air time,
   2) maintaining confidentiality regarding personal statement and
   experiences shared, 3) speaking from ones own experience, and 4)
   encouraging participants to respect their classmates. This is the
   first step in creating an open and respectful environment in the
   classroom.

 <p>    I have come to believe that two things can make or break a diversity
   course-the instructor and the climate of the class. It is important to
   have an open, accepting environment with an instructor that
   facilitates discussion and encourages students to think critically
   about what they read and hear; an instructor that challenges ideas in
   a respectful manner. It is important to remember that for a majority
   of students, this is the first time they are openly talking about
   issues of race and diversity. If the instructor takes on an
   antagonistic position and/or students feel attacked, they will often
   shut down. Unlike many other content areas, issues of diversity often
   have an emotional component. I remember a conversation once with a
   white male doctoral student, who asked if a certain author that was
   writing about diversity and assessment, was black. When I said yes,
   the student replied that he was surprised because the author was able
   to write the piece without "emotionality", and therefore thought he
   was white. When I asked what he meant, he said, "oh you know, when
   people of color talk about these issues it is almost always from an
   emotional perspective". Unfortunately, that is the challenge for many
   faculty of color teaching diversity courses. You are often suspected
   of having a "personal agenda" and approaching the course from an
   emotional stance rather than a rational one. White faculty teaching
   diversity courses also have issues with which they have to contend.
   However, they generally are a different set of issues from those for
   faculty of color. The bottom line is that in courses that deal with
   diversity, one has to take into consideration the intersection of race
   as it relates to the faculty member teaching the course and the race
   of the students.

  <h>   Assignments

 <p>    Second, a strong emphasis is placed on the personal growth of students
   and on students' ability to examine themselves critically. This is the
   awareness piece. Thus, the assignments have been carefully chosen to
   facilitate this. My assignments have not varied over the years. What I
   have chosen has seemed to be effective in allowing the students to
   engage in self-exploration. For example, over the years, I have
   learned that when a class has over 20 participants enrolled, the level
   of participation diminishes. Some students just dont feel comfortable
   talking about "race" despite my trying to set an open, accepting
   atmosphere. For those students, the journal entries become an outlet
   for them to express what they were too fearful to say in class.
   Ironically, what they reveal is not really that controversial.
   However, I think it goes back to us as a society not talking openly
   about issues of race. Some students have difficulty overcoming the
   fear that they will be labeled a "racist" or that they will say
   something that is perceived as "stupid". In a journal reflection, one
   student states, "I became afraid to speak for fear of what others in
   the class might think. This does not mean that I did not learn a lot
   in class, but more often I would discuss what was said with my white
   peers." Because I think discussion of the issues is of utmost
   importance, I now have students break into groups of no more than five
   in several of the sessions, to give them an opportunity to dialogue.
   Students have expressed that they like the small group discussions and
   find them to be less threatening. Other assignments include, a
   cultural heritage paper, cultural immersion experience, interviewing
   two people who are culturally different from them, and a final
   reflection paper.

 <h>    Readings and videotapes

  <p>   Third, a solid and diverse knowledge base is important. At the
   beginning, when I first taught the course, there were not many
   textbooks to choose from. In the past 10 years, the field of diversity
   has grown by leaps and bounds and so have the readings. I struggle to
   keep my reading list reasonable as there is so much I want the
   students to read. At least a third of my readings are individuals
   personal account of their experience with diversity. These readings
   have been effective in helping students understand how issues of
   diversity impact a variety of people on a personal, and in some cases
   professional level. I have also included readings written by whites
   that discuss their own journey towards recognizing their `privilege'
   and working towards the goal of becoming cross culturally competent.
   These have been particularly helpful for the white students who often
   have an overwhelming feeling of guilt. These readings allow them to
   see that their feelings are quite typical and provide them with a
   model for the evolvement of white racial identity.

 <p>    In addition to the readings, for the past five years I have used
   videotapes on a consistent basis. One videotape that has had a
   significant impact, from the students perspective, is the The Color of
   Fear. This is a very powerful video that addresses difficult issues of
   racism, prejudice, and oppression. Because my classes are
   overwhelmingly white, this video allows students to hear an intense
   discussion about these issues from a diverse group of men. Other
   videos used are Ethnic Notions, Tale of O, A Class Divided, True
   Colors, and In the Image of the White Man.

 <h>    Conclusions

 <p>    When teaching this course, it is one of the few times that I wish we
   were on semesters! I never have enough weeks to fit in everything I
   want to share with the students. As a professor, I find the diversity
   course to be one of my most professionally fulfilling endeavors.

  <p>   After 15 years, I still look forward to teaching the diversity course.
   I know that my journey has not ended. Every time I teach the course,
   it is an adventure. I always tell students that I will learn something
   new from them. While I impart knowledge, challenge perspectives, and
   create dialogue amongst individuals, I too gain in ways that cannot be
   measured. In an assignment, a student reflects on his journey in this
   way. He states, "I feel this course was far more enlightening than any
   experience, or any other course I could have taken. It opened my eyes
   to a world I felt was all but gone. I'm not so naÃ¯ve as to think
   racism is an obsolete phenomenon of the past. However, I have been
   shown that it still exists in a magnitude that is almost hard to
   comprehend." Another student reflects on her personal journey in this
   way, "I think that one of the best lessons that I learned from this
   class was that there are no easy answers. Its funny that when you look
   at other people without talking to them you assume that they have it
   all together, and that they somehow hold the key to all the answers
   your are looking for. I felt that if I studied people and understood
   them that I would be able to complete the person I was trying to be. I
   think the greatest gift I received from this class was that it forced
   me to begin dialogues with people who I felt had the answers."

  <p>   The first day I tell students that I hope they leave the class with
   more questions than answers. If they do, they will hopefully continue
   to seek the answers to their questions, thus continuing their journey.
   And I continue my journey, teaching a topic that will hopefully help
   individuals celebrate and understand not only our differences but our
   similarities.
