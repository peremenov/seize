<h>TiVo walked away from Comcast

<p>This writeup from Engadget sums up my feelings about a story in the
   New York Times:

<p>Ok, now we understand why TiVo CEO Michael Ramsay was "promoted"out
     of his job last week. You know how people have been telling TiVohow
     the only way theyâre going to survive would be to convince some
     acable company to license their digital video recorder software for
     useon set-top boxes? Yeah, well according to the New York Times
     lastsummer they were about to score a big deal with Comcast to do
     preciselythis, that is until Ramsay pulled the plug at the last
     moment becausehe was convinced TiVo wasnât getting paid enough
     money or given enoughcontrol over the service.

<p>Remember how DirecTV accounts for 2,000,000 of TiVo's
   3,000,000customers and TiVo lost that relationship?  TiVo was
   negotiating withComcast last summer and offered less than the $1/month
   that they getfrom DirecTV, so Michael Ramsay decided to walk away.

<p>Now it's easy to play Monday morning quarterback in situations
   likethis, but hasn't a big cable company deal been the dream all
   along? And in spite of sub-dollar monthly fees, couldn't the Tahiti
   strategy be an alternate revenue source for those customers?

<p>To be fair, if the Comcast deal had been inked and then TiVo
   wasprevented from introducing innovative products because of their
   threatto the cable companies we'd all be screaming bloody murder.
   It'spossible (note that word, this is pure speculation) that there was
   anon-negotiable clause that said something like "Non-Comcast video
   willnot be available on the TiVo" which would have nixed any of the
   futureplans like partnering with content providers.

<p>When the story of TiVo is written, this Comcast negotiation could be
   the point when the company's outcome was decided.

<h>Comments

<p>Wow, if this is true, it is rather upsetting. Once you walk away from
   an opportunity like that they generally are gone for good. Even if
   they would've gotten very little from the deal, it would've put 'TiVo'
   into many homes, and kept some *other* solution *out*. Which is
   perhaps more important.

<p>TiVo has said they can survive without DirecTV because the overall
   financial benefit of the deal isn't really that large a part of their
   income, but it is still income and my understanding is it is still a
   profitable business. So it is upside.

<p>Tivo fatally believed that its product was hard to deliver.

<p>Market penatration is always a good thing. TiVo has done an excellent
   job at penatrating minds with the DVR concept, but when people see
   other solutions available it lessens the overall value of the TiVo DVR
   brand while improving the value of TiVo concept.

<h>Posted by: Dan at Jan 17, 2005 5:39:50 PM

<p>Agreed they walked away from a deal. But Comcast probably gave the
   lowball offer in a attempt to work from the bottom up on price. Tivo
   not offering a counter offer was plain stupid. However the Comcast
   deal is not said and done. Comcast would likely buy Tivo once they're
   down and out.

<p>FYI Tivo's directtv dominance is being eroded by a soon to be released
   PVR that does not include tivo tech.

<h>Posted by: Corey at Jan 17, 2005 5:43:12 PM

<p>Sorry, I do't understand the comment "the Comcast deal is not said and
   done." I already have a wonderful Comcast DVR already, why would
   Comcast throw it away and use Tivo instead?

<h>Posted by: Thomas at Jan 17, 2005 6:06:18 PM

<p>With the Comcast in-house development team increasing with the
   purchase of Liberate Technology assets, TIVO will have to beg to get
   back into Comcast good books again. They gave up a chance to be in 40
   million homes in the US. Comcast now is in control of their own iTV
   platform, I say they don't need TIVO at all.

<h>Posted by: Jack at Jan 17, 2005 6:11:59 PM

<p>Looking at the other PVRs out there, especially Comcast's, they are
   the clunkiest pieces of junk out there. The Tivo interface is so much
   better looking. Tivo's features are better. Sorry, but you will never
   be able to pry my Tivo from my hands. Not even after I'm dead. The
   best possible solution? Comcast inks a deal with Tivo. Once you use
   Tivo, I think you will feel the same way I do.

<h>Posted by: Will Maitner at Jan 17, 2005 6:57:26 PM

<p>Thomas, I own a Tivo (have owned a few) AND a Comcast dual tuner DVR.
   Guess which I prefer to use, is easier to use, has more features, etc
   etc etc?

<p>Tivo is lightyears (and many many development years) ahead of
   Comcast's stuff.

<p>If I could junk the Comcast tomorrow, and get a Tivo branded PVR that
   directly decoded cable (ie the reason I use the Comcast - no cable box
   issues, dual tuners, etc), I'd do it in a heart beat. Tivo is the gold
   standard in my view. Nothing else is even second place right now.

<h>Posted by: Seth at Jan 17, 2005 7:03:51 PM

<p>Here is what i am worried about, I am a loyal directivo customer and
   well if tivo goes under what happens to all these units.....you think
   the people at tivo would be nice enough to activate a lifetime sub on
   the box before they drown....I dont think I could live without my tivo

<h>Posted by: Atomis at Jan 17, 2005 7:26:13 PM

<p>I could name a few other firms (Digital Equipment is a historical one,
   there are many current ones) where the founder should have stepped
   aside, because the 'parenthood' sentiment just destroys the judgment
   needed to do the right thing. Ramsay' TiVo was a great idea, but not
   doing the comcast deal was suicidal.

<h>Posted by: Monday Evening QB at Jan 17, 2005 7:45:47 PM

<p>Why does everyone assume Comcast was interested in Tivo in order to
   deploy Tivo boxes? Comcast is very wedded to its Motorola platform,
   and now with Liberate has its own PVR development well underway. Tivo
   is a totally different architecture and hardware/OS platform. Me
   thinks this was just Comcast looking to license some patents and
   ideas, not actual products.

<h>Posted by: Friend at Jan 17, 2005 8:14:56 PM

<p>Having a problem with my Comcast box. Certain show will not fast
   forward. This week's episode of 24 on Fox...no pause of ff

<h>Posted by: Amb34 at Jan 17, 2005 8:33:48 PM

<p>While TiVo has made many mistakes strategically (Thomas does a good
   job outlining them on his site), as much as it pains me to say, I dont
   think walking away from Comcast was one of them.

<p>DirecTV's decision not to support HMO / TTG, etc. provides a good
   indication of what a Comcast relationship would have been like -
   restrictive, half-fast and ultimately detrimental to the TiVo brand.

<p>Starting in 2006, the landscape is going to be reset - TiVo will be
   able to offer a single solution which supports native digital signal
   capture (via CableCard), dual tuners (at least), and HD.

<p>TiVo will probably always be the higher-cost provider given the
   service providers deeper pockets, ability to bundle and better
   marketing / distribution economics, but TiVo should be able to get
   creative and discount based on the consumer signing a long-term deal,
   etc.

<p>TiVo being forced to go direct might be best not only for the company,
   but the for the consumer.

<p>TiVo is going to have to out innovate, and out-develop its competitors
   in the form of more functionality, etc. to compete.

<p>Apple has manage to do this in the computer market, and its a > $25BN
   thriving company - which is only a failure when measured relative to
   Microsofts > $250 BN market cap.

<h>Posted by: New York at Jan 17, 2005 8:56:10 PM

<p>Personally, I've caused the placement of 4 tivos into others homes,
   severely influenced another 2. Only 1 of them was directv.

<p>DirecTV WILL have HMO, the current R10 boxes have the screens, there
   are many posts on tivocommunity.

<p>A co-worker just received a plasma hdtv, signed up for comcast HD, got
   their new HD box. He absolutely hates it, (the comcast box), he
   complains _every day_ it locks, up, doesn't record his shows, is hard
   to use. He sums it up as "it's not TIVO".

<p>Another coworker received TIVO for xmas, just installed it this
   weekend. His biggest complaint was setup. If it wasn't from his
   daughter and a wireless modem jack investment, it would have gone back
   he said. He missed antenna vs cable in the setup and misunderstood he
   needed to wipe the box and start over.

<p>After 1 day he was digging the pause, replay and rewind. Will see if
   he watched the news in 7 minutes tomorrow.

<p>Less than a $1.00 a viewer, TIVO makes 12 times that now with
   individual boxes, I think their sales were higher than expected for
   the holidays. Tivo was number # 11 top selling merchandise on Amazon a
   couple of times.

<p>TIVO needs to go on QVC once a month, they'd sell 10,000 units in an
   hour.

<p>I believe their losses are the research on HD unit, the cable card
   unit, the development of the TIVOtoGO. The comparison to Apple is
   sound, how will TIVO be with 500,000 stand along subscribers at the
   end of this year? likely double next year. Every celebrity has a TIVO,
   Oprah gives them away, Ellen gives them away.

<p>Stock is cheap tomorrow I bet.

<p>Atomis - with regards to directivo's, I just called DirecTV support
   and spoke with a tech. He's gotten a ton of calls, and escalated up to
   his manager's manager, and no one inside of the direcTV tech support
   department knows anything about them cancelling support. He says they
   will always support it.

<p>He also claimed to have a personal stake in it, because he loves his
   TiVo. :)

<p>So, don't worry about DirecTiVos becoming obsolete -- you've probably
   got until at least the end of 2007 to continue using it, and by then
   you'll probably need to upgrade anyway in order to be in compliance
   with the government's latest 'anti-piracy' flag that they'll be adding
   to broadcast streams.

<p>ComCast now came out with OnDemand, which is actually really neat,
   though the selection isn't great.

<p>Yet another hard blow for TiVo.

<p>The main problem for Tivo as a company is that they have never
   recognized that they are a software company, not a hardware company.
   They make zero revenue on hardware, and the value to us as
   Tivo/DirecTivo customers is the software and interface.

<p>Tivo software should be running on most DVRs, DirecTVs, Comcasts, Time
   Warner's, HP's, etc....even NDS. The software business model is far
   more sustainable, and supports continued development of added software
   and services to gain additional revenue from installed hardware.

<p>Too bad they have been so misdirected.....especially sad, as I am a
   long time Tivo customer and evangelist.

<p>I thought Microsoft made a billion dollar investment in Comcast to get
   Microsoft code into Comcast cable boxes. Now I use a Comcast/Motorola
   6412 cable box that has Microsoft software "inside". So maybe
   Microsoft is buying market share through the use of low ball license
   fees to beat TiVo?

<p>"The main problem for Tivo as a company is that they have never
   recognized that they are a software company, not a hardware company."

<p>Bob: TiVo has *always* seen itself as a software company, and was
   pulled into the hardware business kicking and screaming. If Philips
   hadn't bailed, I doubt we would have ever seen a TiVo-branded box
   anywhere outside a trade show.

<h>Posted by: Roger Benningfield at Jan 18, 2005 6:16:53 AM

<p>I have no doubt the Comcast deal *did* have all kinds of constraints
   against competition. You can bet that Tahiti was one thing that was
   prohibited. The cable providers are extremely jealous of their
   subscribers, and they protect them like nobody's business. Tahiti is a
   direct threat to their business model.

<p>There aren't any simple answers to Tivo's problems. The fact of the
   matter is that cable providers are in the drivers seat when it comes
   to interactive TV, and they're very good at ensuring they remain so.
   As the NYT article notes, look at who has fallen by the wayside
   (Liberate, OpenTV). There is just no way a cable company is going to
   lose control of their business, or be beholden to a technology
   partner. If that means crappy service (and it does), or glacial
   innovation (and it does), so be it. They have no problem stonewalling
   and just watching ITV companies wither and die.

<h>Posted by: Dave at Jan 18, 2005 7:23:10 AM

<p>"Once you use Tivo, I think you will feel the same way I do."

<p>The problem is, with low-cost and sufficing (if not ideal) DVRs
   available through other sources (e.g., Comcast), at a fraction of the
   price and at higher convenience, the number of folks who will actually
   *try* a TiVo will stay small.

<p>That's the real cost of walking away from the Comcast deal.

<h>Posted by: *** Dave at Jan 18, 2005 9:26:45 AM

<p>Count me in as a 'lost sale' for TiVO. I got Comcast 6412 box and am
   quite happy with it.

<p>What pulled me in:

<l>single box
<l>no need for phone wire
<l>dual tuner
<l>HD capabilities (don't have one now, but may be later..)
<l>no upfront cost and cheaper monthly fee

<p>I haven't encountered any major problems yet.

<p>What I don't like:
<l>remote is not very ergonomical
<l>interface is OK, but nothing to rave about.

<p>Look, I'm sure TiVo is a better product (if you ignore dual tuner and
   HD) but 6412 box is good enough for me and has room to grow, one
   hopes. In the end, being able to watch as much TV as possible is not a
   worthy goal in itself.

<p>You mileage can vary, of course.

<h>Motorola Acquires Ucentric Systems, Extending the Seamless Mobility of
   Digital Video Entertainment through the Home

<p>HORSHAM, Pa. - 18 January 2005 â Motorola, Inc. (NYSE: MOT) today
   announced that the company has acquired privately-held Ucentric
   Systems, Inc., a leading provider of home media networking software
   for the connected home.

<p>This strategic acquisition enables Motorola to actively market
   connected home software solutions to third party service providers and
   consumer electronics manufacturers. A leader in end-to-end broadband
   technologies, Motorola will leverage its global brand presence and
   worldwide resources to grow Ucentric's existing customer base.

<p>The Ucentric software solution provides seamless access to stored
   digital entertainment - such as high-definition video on a DVR, music
   on a computer hard drive, or pictures on a laptop - from any connected
   device in the home. The software is designed to operate with
   electronic program guides from multiple vendors, and service providers
   can customize the interface with applications that personalize the
   subscriber experience.

<p>Additionally, Motorola will make the software available as part of its
   Home Media Architecture solution for the company's advanced and basic
   digital set-top platforms.

<p>"Motorola is committed to bringing relevant seamless mobility
   solutions to the connected home marketplace, and the acquisition of
   Ucentric's suite provides us with a robust software platform for
   delivering the next generation of broadband services. Customers can
   leverage these new tools in our portfolio to deliver new levels of
   personalized entertainment and communication to devices in and around
   the home," said John Burke, Motorola corporate vice president and
   general manager, consumer entertainment solutions.

<p>Ucentric announced a licensing agreement with DIRECTV, Inc. at CES
   2005, the nation's leading and fastest growing digital television
   service provider, to deploy its Home Media Center software platform.
   The new DIRECTV Home Media Center will be comprised of a main unit,
   with smaller units located at each additional TV networked throughout
   the house, to provide DIRECTV customers with digital video recorder
   (DVR) service on all television sets.

<h>Posted by: New York at Jan 18, 2005 5:18:44 PM

<p>I don't know which is sadder, the fact that TiVo missed the boat here
   or that Comcast is such a gorilla, a simple deal gone bad can
   potentially break a company.

<p>You could say that Comcast doesn't need TiVo... No one chooses their
   television service based on the beauty of interface design or how they
   access their programs. However, moving forward, it's all about keeping
   up with and/or copying the things that TiVo has introduced to make
   watching TV that much more of a pleasure. Combined with the fact that
   as a traditional cable company, Comcast, and others, are behind the
   eight ball in how they develop and deploy new technology, compared to
   a traditional consumer electronics company. So in that regard, they do
   need TiVo... and I guess it's just a matter of time until they take
   that over as well.

<p>As a tivo user since its release to the market, I have to say that
   they have the best PVR software by far. However their not doing
   anything that couldnt be done by anyone one else. Result: Tivo either
   needs to step up and make a deal or pretty soon im going to be without
   service.

<h>Posted by: Steven at Jan 19, 2005 7:06:48 AM

<p>None of us know ANYTHING about the terms of this so-called Comcast
   deal.

<p>Perhaps Comcast wouldn't deal unless they get hold of all of TiVo's
   IP?

<p>Where is the proof of this 1$ a month figure that was offered? Maybe
   it was closer to 10c. Or maybe it was a one-time fee.

<p>All of us act like we know so much and could have done a better job.
   But we have no clue what the truth is.

<p>I think this NYT article is full of it.

<h>Posted by: Johanes at Jan 19, 2005 1:36:01 PM

<p>I bought a ReplayTV 3 years ago and dearly love it, as does my wife.
   Not quite a TiVo like I recommended to my brother-in-law, but it was
   cheap at the time and we love the auto-commercial skip.

<p>But, when our old TV finally went belly up we bought a Phillips CRT
   HDTV at CostCo, thinking we need to be ready for the future.

<p>Then, of course, to get value out of it we ordered HD service with the
   DVR from Comcast, figuring to pay Comcast the $9.95/month we were
   paying ReplayTV -- a wash. Of course the HD service was $5, and... to
   get ESPN HD and TNT HD we needed to upgrade to digital cable as well.
   So my cable bill goes up $30/month and my Replay bill goes down $10.

<p>The DVR is Scientific Atlanta 8300 HD, and it amazes me how inferior
   the interface is compared to a 3-year old box from the second best DVR
   company. My wife begged for her ReplayTV back, and even started
   watching tennis in the back room on my crappy 19" set, which has the
   ReplayTV for the moment.

<p>That is, until we watched the US Open Tennis final on the comcast DVR
   in 16:9 HD. Beautiful, we just had to do a lot of (rather slow) fast
   forwarding.

<p>If and when TiVo comes out with the dual tuner HD cablecard machine
   discussed here, and if it can replace what comcast gave me I will
   seriously consider it -- but I doubt the new users of the comcast box
   will, because if the SA 8300 HD is all you have ever seen it will
   probably seem good enough.
