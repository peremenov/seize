<h>Pessimism on the 2nd round 4 Feb 2004

<p>The DPRK announcement on 3 February 2004 that it has agreed to resume
    the 6-way talks in Beijing on 25 February is a welcome development,
     but there is no indication that either Pyongyang or Washington are
   ready for the significant concessions necessary to make progress on a
                      solution for the nuclear crisis.

<p>The 6 parties have failed to agree on a pre-talks statement to
       determine the scope of this round, as the DPRK had insisted in
     December, and it seems the scope is minimal: the DPRK will present
    details on its proposal to freeze its nuclear program, and the other
   parties will have a chance to put their positions forward. As the US,
    South Korea, and Japan are closely coordinating their strategy, and
      China and Russia's only concern seems to be to avoid a military
       confrontation, the game will be played between Washington and
                                 Pyongyang.

<p>We share the pessimism voiced by Jack Pritchard, former US negotiator
   for North Korea on 21 January 2004 after his visit to Pyongyang: 'I am
       concerned that the next round of six-party talks will fail and
           Pyongyang will withdraw from the diplomatic process.'

<h>Elusive talks 15 Jan 2004

<p>This article was published by Asia Times Online on 24 January 2004 in
                        the Speaking Freely section.

<p>On the first anniversary of the DPRK's withdrawal from the NPT there
      are few reasons to be optimistic about a solution of the nuclear
       crisis on the Korean peninsula. Pyongyang has vowed to further
      build-up its military force while claiming to be in favour of a
      negotiated peaceful resolution, and in fact Washington is doing
    exactly the same. As Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Losyukov put it
   last week 'mistrust and excessive demands on each other' by Washington
    and Pyongyang are the reasons for the continuing delay of the second
                           round of 6-way talks.

<p>As a sign of frustration, South Korean Foreign Minister Yoon admitted
     he is hoping the talks can be held in the first half of this year.
    South Korea, Russia, and Japan seem to be less and less involved in
    the preparations for the talks; the conditions are set in Pyongyang
   and Washington, and both think they have Beijing on their side. Seoul
   and Tokyo are kept in the loop to foot the bill if economic assistance
   is ever going to be provided, as they did for the KEDO project. Japan
     and South Korea have paid a total of US$1.3b, or 70% of the total,
       while the US with only 21% seems to be firmly in charge of the
                                consortium.

<p>After the US hinted it is willing to provide security assurances,
       Pyongyang has specified its additional demands in exchange for
   refreezing the Yongbyon nuclear facilities. In fact these demands are
       similar to what Pyongyang should have gotten out of the Agreed
     Framework of 1994: delist the DPRK as a sponsor of terrorism, lift
    political, economic and military sanctions, and supply heavy oil and
     other energy resources to the DPRK. The US will not accept a mere
   freeze of Yongbyon; it is prepared to provide security assurances, but
       only in return of a DPRK promise to dismantle all its nuclear
     facilities, irreversibly, because as US Secretary of State Powell
              says, `we do not want to see this movie again.'

<p>Over the last few weeks there has been intensive diplomacy to come to
   an agreement on the scope of the first step to be taken by both sides.
   The DPRK has been demanding such a pre-talks agreement because it does
    not want to participate in a useless talking session like the first
     round back in August. It looks extremely unlikely that the US will
      offer any economic assistance or improved political relations in
           addition to a security guarantee in this first phase.

<p>Another issue that will inevitably complicate negotiations is the
   alleged DPRK uranium enrichment program, which was in fact the trigger
     of the current crisis. The US will of course want to include this
   program in a DPRK promise to end its nuclear activities, but last week
   it became clear that even China is not convinced the DPRK actually has
      such a uranium program. Chinese officials reportedly said the US
      government briefing provided to them had not been sufficient to
      convince China that the DPRK had such a program. In the current
    climate, no country will indeed easily accept US intelligence on the
       existence of WMD facilities in an axis-of-evil member country.

<p>Referring to Libya, the DPRK Foreign Ministry issued a statement
    saying the US should not expect Pyongyang to follow the example and
     renounce its weapons. The Workers' Party newspaper recently argued
     Iraq made a big mistake accepting the weapons inspections and not
    preparing for war. How an international inspection mechanism beyond
      the Yongbyon facilities will ever work in the DPRK remains a key
     question. Indeed as UN inspector Hans Blix noticed, it is hard to
    prove that something does not exist. If the US insists on nationwide
   inspections while the DPRK continues to deny having a uranium program,
      negotiations will get stuck, and the Kim dynasty will remain in
    war-mode as it has been since it established the DPRK 55 years ago.
    The imperialist threat might well become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

<h>No moral high ground in Beijing 20 Aug 2003

<p>This article was published by Asia Times Online on 23 August 2003 in
                        the Speaking Freely section.

<p>Next week all eyes will be on Beijing while the six powers will sit
     down to start negotiating a solution for the North Korean nuclear
       crisis. A sort of mini-United Nations session, with the three
   heavyweights of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council,
   and the three local stakeholders: Japan, and North and South Korea. A
    year ago, while Pyongyang's bilateral ties with Seoul and Tokyo were
        blossoming after Koizumi's visit to Pyongyang, this seating
                  arrangement would have made some sense.

<p>However, since the start of the nuclear crisis after the visit of US
   Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly to Pyongyang in October 2002,
    old alliances have been reinforced, and at least in the mind of the
   DPRK the three (ex)communist states will be on one side of the table,
   facing the US and its allies, who none of them has official diplomatic
       relations with Pyongyang, on the other side. But the Cold War
    divisions have blurred; both Moscow and Beijing have close economic
    ties with their three former capitalist foes. They have also stated
      that they will not accept the presence of nuclear weapons on the
   Korean peninsula. As the regional nuclear powers, it is in both their
              interest to maintain this strategic status quo.

<p>The two old comrades did suggest that they can play a role in
   guaranteeing the DPRK's security, as Washington has clearly stated it
        will not offer the formal non-aggression treaty Pyongyang is
    demanding. The Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Losyukov said that it
   is only logical that Pyongyang seeks a security guarantee; Moscow and
   Beijing are ready to offer a collective security guarantee if what the
      US is prepared to offer does not satisfy the DPRK. Pyongyang has
   already replied that this is beside the point, it has never considered
                   either Russia or China to be a threat.

<p>One of the more worrying comments made over the last few weeks was a
   statement by former US Ambassador Robert Grey in the Washington Times
      of 14 August, which indicates that the US has come to regard the
           principle of pre-emptive action as international law:
     North Korea must understand that absent a diplomatic solution, the
   international community is prepared, however reluctantly, to use force
         to put an end to North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons.
   It is unclear who Grey has in mind when he speaks of the international
    community; in any case after Iraq it is rather unlikely that the UN
    Security Council would allow the use of force to attack a sovereign
    country that is no imminent threat to world peace. For months the US
    has been pushing for a UN Security Council statement condemning the
    DPRK for its nuclear program, but Russia and China have blocked this
          move, knowing that it would only complicate a solution.

<p>Of the six parties involved in the talks, only the US is stressing
   that the military option remains on the table. The closest the US has
     got to a 'coalition of the willing', is its Proliferation Security
     Initiative (PSI), a group of 8 European countries plus Australia,
   Japan, and the US. They are looking at the interdiction of DPRK ships
    exporting alleged WMD, and at meetings in Madrid and Brisbane, they
      have so far agreed to exchange information and hold interdiction
     training exercises, starting next month off the Australian coast.

<p>The priority of all six countries around the table next week will be
      to defend their own national security. None of the participating
     countries should put itself on the moral high ground and claim to
    represent the international community. In order to make progress and
    make the world a safer place, they will all need to give in order to
    receive. Washington's declared reluctance to negotiate, despite its
      verbal support for a diplomatic solution, will be the key issue.

<h>Panmunjom circus 27 July 2003

<p>This article was published by Asia Times Online on 1 August 2003 in
                        the Speaking Freely section.

<p>On 27 July 2003 it was exactly 50 years ago that the Korean War came
     to an end with the signing of the Armistice Agreement by the DPRK,
    China, and the US-led United Nations Command (UNC). In the DPRK mass
    celebrations were held to commemorate the victory in the fatherland
    liberation war. On the South side as well, US General LaPorte stated
    in Panmunjom that the armistice represents nothing short of victory.
   These claims illustrate that during 50 years of non-war, nothing much
                          has changed. Or has it?

<p>While the US forces did their utmost best during the various
        ceremonies to stress the UN alliance against the 'communist
   aggression', actually most of the 21 nations that came to defend South
   Korea under the UN flag have fundamentally altered their relationship
   with the DPRK over the last 50 years. Most of them now have diplomatic
    relations with Pyongyang. Prime Minister Helen Clark of New Zealand,
     which established diplomatice relations with the DPRK in 2001, was
    allowed to make a speech at the ceremony in Panmunjom, but her call
      for a peaceful solution to the present nuclear crisis contrasted
    sharply with LaPorte's memories of the glorious past and a confident
                                  future.
 
<p>When General LaPorte presented a UN flag to Prime Minister Clark and
       South Korean General Paek as a gift, Pyongyang must have been
    outraged. The simple fact that the Soviet Union was absent from the
   Security Council in 1950 in protest against the exclusion of communist
      China, has allowed the US to continue to use the UN cover for 50
     years. This has generated the strange contradiction that countries
     part of the Armistice Agreement, and thus still technically at war
     with the DPRK, already have established diplomatic relations with
     Pyongyang. This paradox proves that the only countries that really
   matter in the UNC are the US and the ROK. Ironically the DPRK has also
   been a member of the UN since 1991, when it joined at the same time as
                                  the ROK

<p>But of course these ceremonies were all about the war veterans, aged
    70+ nowadays. They feel proud for having contributed to prevent the
    third world war, and enabled the Republic of Korea to become what it
    is today: a thriving democracy respected around the world. To their
   convenience they often forget that for many years after the war, South
    Korea was much poorer than the North, and that Seoul only started to
   catch up economically during the 18 years of military dictatorship of
    Park Chung-hee. Hundreds of South Koreans died in their struggle for
       democracy, while the UNC was guarding the country against the
                                communists.

<p>The truce village of Panmunjom reminds some visitors of an amusement
   park, and it certainly looked like one during the ceremonies on 27
   July 2003. American rock music and stalls selling armistice
   merchandise welcomed us in the Joint Security Area. US veterans and
   their family members dressed in all colours of the rainbow were in the
   majority. After the speeches we were offered a lavish buffet in the
   main building at 20 meters from the Military Demarcation Line, and
   some US soldiers encouraged us to take food outside so the North
   Korean soldiers could watch us eating. 'Only the elite serves here',
   the US sergeant had proudly told us on the bus.

<p>Whereas the exact circumstances of the start of the Korean War 53
   years ago will remain a point of discussion, it is clear today that a
      peace treaty, as recommended in the original Armistice Agreement
   within 3 months, is long overdue. It is sad that celebrating 50 years
    of status-quo has not been an incentive to the other UNC members to
     urge the US to negotiate such a peace treaty with Pyongyang, or in
     case Washington continues its confrontational stance, to formally
                           withdraw from the UNC.

<h>Awkward anniversaries 2 June 2003

<p>This article was published by Asia Times Online on 4 June 2003 in the
                          Speaking Freely section.

<p>On 27 July this year it will be exactly 50 years ago that the DPRK,
    the PRC, and the UN signed the armistice that brought the Korean War
      to an end. On both sides of the DMZ there will be ceremonies to
       commemorate this event: communist groups around the world will
    celebrate the North's victory over the imperialist forces, while the
     16 nations that came to defend South Korea under the UN flag will
    remember how they rolled back the communist aggression. Celebrating
       these old alliances will underscore the division of the Korean
     peninsula and it should in that sense be a painful affair for both
      Koreas. However, Pyongyang has managed to turn its memory of the
       Korean War into resistance against the US imperialists, which
    continues until today and is in fact the main legitimising force of
                                its regime.

<p>With the arrival of the crab catching season, the North and South have
       also started accusing each other again of violations of their
   territorial waters. On 1 June the South Korean navy even fired warning
    shots at North Korean fishing boats. Last year similar incidents led
   to a naval clash with 4 deaths on the South Korean side. If the issue
   of the Northern Limit Line (NLL) acts as a barometer for Inter-Korean
            relations, we can surely expect more fireworks soon.
    Before we get to the armistice celebrations in July, another Korean
    anniversary will pass: on 15 June 2003 it will have been three years
   since the Inter-Korean summit between Kim Jong Il and Kim Dae-jung in
    Pyongyang. The result of this historic meeting was the 15 June Joint
   Declaration, in which they agreed to improve economic cooperation and
   promote reunification. Since then, some progress has indeed been made:
   South Korean tourists were able to cross the DMZ by bus for the first
   time last February to visit the Mount Kumgang resort in the North, but
                that road was closed again after two weeks.

<p>Reconnection of the railway lines in the East and the West has been
      delayed so many times that the latest agreement at the difficult
     economic talks at the end of May to hold the ceremonies on 10 June
   this year seems far too optimistic. The same goes for the announcement
   that the Kaesong Industrial Park will finally have its ground-breaking
     ceremony at the end of June 2003. Pyongyang and Seoul have allowed
   their workers, women, athletes, and families to meet each other, share
      their sadness about the national division and issue nationalist
     statements calling for reunification; nevertheless on a government
     level trust remains thin. As a result of the nuclear crisis, today
    both sides are using the Joint Declaration merely to criticise each
                             others behaviour.

<p>Pyongyang recently claimed Seoul was violating the Declaration by
      'hurling mud at the dignified system of the DPRK' when the South
    Korean National Security Adviser Ra Jong-yil said about Inter-Korean
    cooperation that the North's regime should be distinguished from its
   residents. When chief North Korean delegate Pak Chang Ryon threatened
   with an 'unspeakable disaster' at the economic talks last week if the
    South would turn to confrontation, Seoul suspended the talks saying
     that such a statement went against the Declaration. Then after two
       days of impasse, they suddenly managed to agree on yet another
   optimistic timeframe for some cooperation projects. These two examples
       show that even without outside powers involved, the two Korean
               governments do not easily find common ground.

<p>Pyongyang does not miss a chance to bring up the Declaration whenever
   it gets the impression that Seoul is getting too close to Washington,
     as with president Roh Moo-hyun's US visit and joint statement with
       president Bush on 14 May. The North Korean regime is aiming at
      nationalist and anti-US feelings in the South with its mantra of
   'achieving reconciliation and reunification by our nation itself under
   the banner of the June 15 Joint Declaration'. President Roh has a hard
     time aligning his strategy for the nuclear crisis with Washington,
    without damaging Inter-Korean relations. Pyongyang keeps waving the
    Declaration accusing Seoul of pro-US servile diplomacy, while it is
   further building up its military under the 'Songun' army-first policy.
        With all that artillery aimed at Seoul no half-working Joint
             Declaration should reassure anyone in South Korea.

<h>Anti-imperialism recycled 8 May 2003

<p>There must have been extremely little to discuss at the recent
    trilateral talks in Beijing. The DPRK put forward what it calls its
    bold new proposal, and the US repeated it will not negotiate before
   Pyongyang abandons its nuclear weapons programs. The US administration
       agrees with Russia, South Korea, Japan, and China to work on a
     peaceful solution based on dialogue, but it is clear that the word
       dialogue has a different meaning to the governments involved.

<p>Meanwhile Pyongyang is stepping up its war rhetoric, making South
   Korea and Japan nervous. The standoff with the imperialist superpower
     adds legitimacy to the regime of Kim Jong Il, who continues in his
    father's footsteps protecting the country against the US and Japan.
   This anti-imperialist struggle is the essence of the Pyongyang regime,
   and indeed of the DPRK as a state. The current crisis justifies years
    of army-first policy and strengthens the leadership of Kim Jong Il.
    Over the last 50 years, the DPRK propaganda has not changed at all,
   but if it sounded a bit out-of-date ten years ago, unfortunately today
    it seems to make sense again. The US doctrine of pre-emptive strikes
   has allowed the DPRK to recycle half a century of propaganda, and puts
    Kim Jong Il in his favourite role, preparing for a war to defend the
                    country against the US imperialists.

<p>Obviously Kim Jong Il would have to worry much more about his position
      if relations with the US were improving. As soon as North Korea
   becomes a normal member of the international community, the Pyongyang
      regime will have to re-invent itself, to gain legitimacy in the
   absence of any external threats. Maybe this insight could help foreign
      governments who want to see change in North Korea to take a more
               constructive approach to the Pyongyang regime.

<h>A challenge for China 18 April 2003

<p>It all went rather fast after Pyongyang's indication that it would not
    insist on a bilateral format for talks with the US if Washington was
      willing to change its hostile policy towards the DPRK. The Bush
   administration is very pleased that China has finally decided to play
           an active role, proposing trilateral talks in Beijing.

<p>The fact that these three parties have agreed to talk is in itself a
     breakthrough, but there is little reason to believe that the Bush
     administration will adopt a more constructive approach then it has
    until now. Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly will demand that
     Pyongyang dismantles its two nuclear programs before he will offer
     anything in return. Meanwhile he will insist that South Korea and
   Japan should join the talks. Pyongyang does not want to involve Seoul
   and Tokyo; it has been rather frustrated by the fact that the current
    crisis, which Pyongyang insists is only between the US and the DPRK,
    has destroyed much of the progress it had made with South Korea and
                              Japan recently.

<p>From the viewpoint of Pyongyang, the security issue can only be
    settled in direct talks. However, a trilateral setting with China is
    the next best thing, as Pyongyang probably expects China to support
    its basic analysis that the US is a threat to North Korea, and bears
    responsibility for this crisis. Once they can agree on the necessary
   steps to eliminate the mutual security concerns, such as international
    monitoring, a non-aggression treaty etc, maybe Pyongyang will accept
    South Korea, Japan, and possibly Russia, around the table to discuss
    aid and economic cooperation with the North. However, such a process
       requires considerable confidence between the parties, which is
   currently non-existant. The question is whether China will be able to
        build the necessary trust between Washington and Pyongyang.

<h>Pyongyang's lost friends 21 March 2003

<p>Only 6 months after the historic meeting in Pyongyang between Japanese
   PM Koizumi and the North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, Japan is deploying
        its Aegis surveillance ships to monitor North Korean missile
   operations, and warns Pyongyang it will scrap their joint declaration
      if the North carries out a ballistic missile test. On the Korean
    peninsula president Roh, the heir of Kim Dae-jung's sunshine policy,
     has put the South Korean army on its highest alert since 1996, for
     fear of North Korean provocations during the Iraq war. After major
   diplomatic breakthroughs with Seoul and Tokyo over the last few years,
                Kim Jong Il is losing his new friends fast.

<p>Washington recently surprised with signals that it is considering
     withdrawing its troops from South Korea. The Pyongyang propaganda
     machine was probably already preparing victory statements after 50
   years of anti-imperialist struggle on the Korean peninsula, but quite
   unexpectedly the new South Korean government stated that the US troops
        should remain near the DMZ as a tripwire. So much for Korean
     reconciliation and the compatriotic feelings that had been warming
    since the Kim-Kim summit in June 2000. After 3 years of sunshine and
    some slow progress on Inter-Korean projects the relations across the
     DMZ are quickly cooling again. The historic overland route to the
    North's Mt Kumgang resort crossing the DMZ for the first time in 50
    years was a major breakthrough in February, but only operated for 2
     weeks. The railway lines that could link South Korea to China and
   Russia are still not reconnected. They can not even agree on the size
   on the building for family reunions in Mt Kumgang. Pyongyang and Seoul
     have allowed their workers, women, athletes, families to meet each
     other, share their sadness about the national division, and issue
    nationalist statements calling for reunification; nevertheless on a
   higher level trust remains thin. The new Roh government is asking the
       US troops to stay, meaning that Seoul despite all the sunshine
   continues to feel threatened by Kim Jong Il. Roh has also adopted the
    Bush line of advocating a multilateral setting to solve the nuclear
    crisis. At their planned meeting next month in Washington, they will
   align their policies further. The only matter that seems to divide the
    long-time allies is urgency: the South Korean economy is starting to
           feel the effects of decreasing investor's confidence.

<p>Pyongyang's other new friendship has proven even more superficial.
      After the Koizumi-Kim meeting last September in Pyongyang, Japan
   seemed ready to start serious business with North Korea. Japan is one
      of the DPRK's main trading partners, of roughly the same size as
     Inter-Korean trade in 2001 (around US$400m). Unfortunately Koizumi
       miscalculated the domestic impact of the issue of the Japanese
   abductees, and the diplomatic process derailed after Tokyo refused to
   send the abductees back to Pyongyang. For Pyongyang the issue remains
    a Japanese apology and financial compensation for the past colonial
     rule. However, Japan is panicking about North Korean missiles, and
     threatens to abrogate the Pyongyang Declaration if the North would
   test-fire a ballistic missile. Pyongyang claims Japan is violating the
    Declaration with its plans to launch a spy satellite and establish a
       missile defence system, and thus reserves the right to resume
   ballistic missile tests if Japan carries on with these `hostile acts'.
     In its anti-imperialist rhetoric Pyongyang has even suggested that
   hard-line elements in Japan are trying to use the North Korean missile
    threat as an excuse to invade Korea again. Nevertheless the Japanese
       did mention the idea of preemptive strikes in case North Korea
    prepared to launch a long-range missile, and it will soon launch its
                satellite with a Japanese ballistic missile.

<p>Until six months ago diplomatic initiatives were well underway to
   establish a new regional stability in East Asia less dependent on the
    US umbrella. The loss of these two friends brings Pyongyang back to
    square one, with Seoul confirming its dependence on Washington, and
    Japan unwilling to come clear with its colonial past. Throughout the
     nuclear crisis Pyongyang has been calling Japan and South Korea to
        continue on the constructive path set out in their bilateral
    declarations, but Pyongyang's standoff with Washington has seriously
    hurt the new friendships. As Japan and South Korea are falling back
    into step with Washington, the difference between bilateral talks as
     requested by Pyongyang, and the multilateral approach of the Bush
     administration is fading. Pyongyang will get its direct talks with
   Washington, but only when the situation will have escalated far enough
     for South Korea and Japan to be hiding behind the US. That moment
    might be very near, as Kim Jong Il has no reason to wait. To his own
   frustrations he has failed to find a way to put pressure on Washington
     without hurting his relations with Seoul and Tokyo. Kim Jong Il's
    diplomatic initiatives may have been genuine, but his reputation is
                               haunting him.

<h>Do not fear, they tell each other 18 March 2003

<p>What an intruiging situation; the US Ambassador in Seoul says that the
    DPRK has an 'irrational fear' of the US. On the other side, a recent
      official North Korean statement said it was 'quite senseless and
      unreasonable' for the US to insist that the DPRK poses a nuclear
                             threat to the US.

<p>However, the existential fears of Pyongyang seemed a little more
       justified when president Bush announced the invasion of Iraq,
       including regime change. For its part, Pyongyang should not be
       secretive about its alleged nuclear program, leaving the world
           guessing about the North Korean nuclear capabilities.

<p>These people would have so much stuff to talk about; if only they
                          would sit down together.

<h>Postponing diplomacy 14 March 2003

<p>From different sides Americans are urging president Bush to start
       negotiations with North Korea. Not only Democrats and academic
         experts, but also conservative Republicans are telling the
        administration that refusing to talk with Pyongyang carries
   considerable risks. US Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly claims
   that North Korea will soon be able to produce nuclear weapons from its
   plutonium and uranium enrichment programs. However, his boss seems in
     no rush to sit down and talk with Pyongyang. According to the CIA,
    North Korea has been possessing one or two nuclear weapons for many
       years already, and indeed a couple more would not change that
                          situation dramatically.

<p>Conservative opponents of the current policy want the administration
       to talk with Pyongyang, to explain Kim Jong Il that he has to
   dismantle his programs or else the US will strike. The proposed talks
    are very short, and bound to fail because North Korea will not gain
     anything substantial in return. In fact the Bush administration is
     aiming for a similar outcome by pushing for a UN Security Council
     statement that would condemn North Korea's non-compliance with its
       IAEA Safeguards Agreement. Pyongyang would label such a narrow
   approach to this crisis as unfair and reject any UN interference. The
   Bush administration would then use this as a justification for the use
     of force against North Korea. For this reason China is at present
    blocking such a statement by the Security Council, and urging the US
                           to have direct talks.

<p>On the other side, US Korea experts are urging the Bush administration
     to engage in a much more comprehensive dialogue with the Pyongyang
        regime. These talks would include the dismantling of nuclear
     capabilities, resumed missile negotiations, discussion on a peace
   mechanism to end the Korean war and reduce US troops in the South, and
   support for the economic development of North Korea. This is perfectly
   in line with the North Korean statement that it is 'quite possible to
   find a solution for the nuclear issue'. It remains a question whether
    the Bush administration would consider a solution that does not lead
                to its ultimate objective of regime change.

<p>Pyongyang must have had high hopes when Roh Moo-hyun took office.
    South Korean president Roh supports engagement and has excluded any
    military action against the North. However, his government is moving
   closer to the US position of favouring multilateral talks, and sees a
   continuing role for US troops in the South. This is angering the North
   and it has warned that Inter-Korean relations might go back to a state
     of confrontation. Seoul intends to work with the US to resolve the
    crisis, but this will take time: president Roh's visit to Washington
                       is planned for next April/May.
<p>Meanwhile the alignment of the South Korean and US positions is
     further raising military tensions on the Korean peninsula. Bush's
     tactical move to involve the UN Security Council seems stuck, and
    under domestic pressure, sooner or later the US will talk with North
     Korea as Powell has stated. The US attitude towards such talks can
   either be constructive, or they can be seen as a necessary prelude for
   action. Threatened by the US military buildup and war games across the
     DMZ, it is unlikely that Kim will sit back and relax until Roh and
     Bush come up with a plan to talk in summer. Expect some fireworks.

<h>UN Security Council's tough task 25 Feb 2003

<p>This article was published by Asia Times Online on 27 February 2003 in
                        the Speaking Freely section.

<p>On February 19 the United Nations Security Council decided to refer
     the letter it received from the International Atomic Energy Agency
    (IAEA) to its experts for further consultations before starting the
    discussion in the council. Thereby they acknowledged that the North
         Korean nuclear issue is a complicated matter, conveniently
         oversimplified by the international press into Pyongyang's
    non-compliance with the Safeguards Agreement. Meanwhile Pyongyang is
     arguing that it no longer has any relations with the IAEA after it
    withdrew from the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) on January 10, and
      that the agency therefore should not intervene in North Korea's
         internal affairs. This claim is not given any attention in
     international media, to the advantage of the United States, which
             favors multilateral talks to resolve this crisis.

<p>In March 1993, a year after signing its Safeguards Agreement with the
   IAEA, North Korea announced its withdrawal from the NPT, giving three
   months' notice. The US persuaded Pyongyang to suspend this withdrawal
   one day before it was going to become effective, on June 11, 1993. One
   year later, in June 1994, North Korea withdrew its IAEA membership. A
     couple of months later the nuclear crisis came to an end with the
     signing of the Agreed Framework, which specified that North Korea
      would remain party to the NPT, and the IAEA would be allowed to
   monitor the freeze of certain facilities. However, North Korea did not
     rejoin the IAEA, and the agreement linked full compliance with the
    Safeguards Agreement to the completion of two light-water reactors.

<p>Last month North Korea announced it was withdrawing from the NPT with
    immediate effect, in fact ending the suspension of its withdrawal in
      1993. Thus North Korea joins India, Pakistan, and Israel, three
    countries that are not signatories to the NPT but can get away with
      that without having to fear a regime change. Maybe because they
                   organize elections from time to time.

<p>North Korea is certainly in breach of the Agreed Framework, because it
   ended the freeze of the nuclear facilities at Yongbyon. However, this
   commitment was part of a bilateral deal with the United States in 1994
    in which Washington agreed to provide formal assurances to Pyongyang
        against the threat or use of nuclear weapons by the US, and
    normalization of political and economic relations. Whether the IAEA
      had the right to declare North Korea in breach of the Safeguards
    Agreement, disconnecting the entire matter from the Agreed Framework
     as Washington prefers, is a matter the UN Security Council should
    examine. Pyongyang has stated that it does not object to the crisis
   being discussed in the UN Security Council, as long as the role of the
                     United States is also brought up.

<p>IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei has said the Safeguards Agreement remains
    in force and binding; nevertheless it is clear that Pyongyang has a
     different opinion on this, so the matter needs to be discussed at
   least. It is not difficult to understand why Pyongyang calls the IAEA
   a "political waiting maid of the US" after ElBaradei started to throw
        around comments on how to solve this nuclear crisis, clearly
               overstepping the technical role of his agency.

<p>The first task of the UN Security Council will be to determine whether
      the IAEA-North Korea Safeguards Agreement is still in force, or
   whether the IAEA's specific task in North Korea was a component of the
     bilateral Agreed Framework. One hopes that the UN Security Council
     will thus seize the opportunity to consider the root causes of the
    current crisis, and not only focus on the DPRK's strained relations
        with the IAEA. Washington will try to take advantage of the
   multilateral setting of the Security Council to reduce this crisis to
   a non-proliferation issue, in order to alienate Pyongyang further and
   hide its own Agreed Framework commitments under a multilateral cover.

<h>Opportunity for the UN Security Council 19 Feb 2003

<p>The fact that the DPRK nuclear issue is going to be discussed in the
         UN Security Council presents a unique opportunity for the
    international community to urge both parties to the Agreed Framework
    to comply with their obligations. A nuclear-free Korean peninsula is
      in everybody's interest, and there seems to be an international
     consensus that the US should allow bilateral talks with the DPRK.

<p>The US has hinted that it will not accept a new freeze of the DPRK's
     nuclear facilities, but instead will require them to be dismantled
     completely. Certainly this can be acceptable to the DPRK if it can
    count on foreign assistance to rehabilitate its energy sector, e.g.
               through international financial institutions.

<p>Hopefully the UN Security Council will seize the opportunity to
   consider the root causes of the current crisis, and not just focus on
   the non-compliance of the DPRK with the IAEA Safeguards Agreement. If
   it fails to examine the DPRK version of the events, it is not unlikely
   that Pyongyang will accuse the Security Council of being a tool of the
                  US, and it might be right in that case.

<h>The other side of the Agreed Framework 16 Dec 2002

<p>It should be clear that the DPRK never saw the 1994 Agreed Framework
    as a simple peace-for-energy deal, where it would receive an energy
    package if it agreed to stop producing nuclear weapons. The US seems
      unwilling to accept the view from Pyongyang that it sees itself
   threatened by the US, with its large military presence in South Korea
      and Japan. In the post-Cold War era nuclear deterrence may seem
    out-dated, but the DPRK's efforts do correspond with a real fear in
     Pyongyang of being the next target for a pre-emptive US attack or
    regime change. Receiving membership of Bush's 'axis of evil' is not
      exactly the 'formal assurance that it would not threaten or use
    nuclear weapons against the DPRK', as the US agreed to provide under
                     section 3 of the Agreed Framework.

<p>Even through the current crisis the DPRK keeps calling for a
    non-aggression pact with the US. The energy deal can be considered a
      by-product of the 1994 nuclear crisis; the essence was that both
    parties agreed on how to remove mutual security threats. In the case
    of the DPRK, that was easily done by freezing the graphite-moderated
   reactors and putting the facilities under IAEA surveillance. But what
    has the US done in return to reassure the DPRK? Washington has been
   reluctant to normalise economic and political bilateral relations, as
   agreed under section 2 of the Agreed Framework, and when Bush finally
       sent an envoy to Pyongyang it was not for constructive talks.

<p>As far as the Agreed Framework's energy deal goes, the DPRK already
   felt betrayed with the delay of the completion of two KEDO Light Water
   Reactors by at least 5 years. Recently the US decided to suspend Heavy
       Fuel Oil deliveries, and that leaves the DPRK no choice but to
   reactivate its reactors frozen under the Agreed Framework, to produce
     much-needed electricity. As nuclear power plants around the world
    show, it is possible to produce nuclear energy peacefully. The DPRK
     has repeatedly stated it seeks a peaceful solution to the nuclear
   issue. The IAEA could reinforce its monitoring programme to make sure
     no fuel is used for military purposes. It seems the DPRK would not
   refuse such inspections if the US would agree to sign a non-aggression
                 treaty and finally finish the Korean War.
