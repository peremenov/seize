<h>on leaving 

<p>It is a terrible and wonderful thing to be an outsider.

<p>To travel is to step outside. Leaving affords an opportunity rare in
   my insulated world: a chance to be completely out of my depth. Even
   when I travel with someone familiar, as I did recently with my wife, I
   may find myself in situations beyond my understanding. In such
   moments, at risk, I gain the world.

<p>By 'beyond understanding' I mean more than a simple intellectual
   failing. The challenges of travel, after all, include the trivial,
   such as the inability to follow instructions or read street signs.

<p>Trivial problems are to be expected, they are expected. Confronting
   them, the traveler is reassured by the poverty of their scale, and
   that of their solution: buy a phrasebook, learn to read Devanagari,
   perform every action with the right hand. No problem. If I get on the
   wrong train at the border, I will simply go in a different direction.
   No problem.

<p>The first phrase I learn in many languages is no problem. No problem,
   because my life will parse itself into the paragraphs of travelers'
   narrative either way. The greater the snafu, the greater the dryness
   at its telling. 'That reminds me of this time, in the desert outside
   ...'

<p>Trivial discomforts of dislocation are trivial because they are more
   than compensated for by the comfort the traveler takes in overcoming
   them. They do not dislodge my ego; au contraire, they ingratiate
   themselves to it with borrowed familiarity. They place me in a
   narrative: I catch myself thinking, this misunderstanding, that
   fiasco, is one I have read about. I congratulate myself that in
   proving equal to such woes, I join a fraternity of the worldly.

<p>The wisdom I collect from these moderate failures is only moderately
   valuable. If I travel and come home with only it to show, the trip was
   still worthwhile.

<p>But of course, if this is as far as I get, I never really left.

<p>Occasionally, fortunately, the world conspires, and I am shocked into
   a moment of genuine presence. The occasion is often a personal failure
   of fundamental understanding, where understanding transcends the
   grammar of associative consciousness.

<p>A defining characteristic of these moments is that I get that I don't
   get it.

<p>Not getting it is not easy. I am a prisoner of my ego and my
   autosycophantic confidence in my own intuitions. A willing prisoner,
   for I worship my intuition.

<p>But when I travel in a different culture, intuition is a false god.
   One very hard to dislodge: it has features so familiar I forget it is
   there. It is woven into and underpins my ritual habits. It is the idol
   packed most carefully in my pack. Understandably: I want to believe
   that I understand where I am.

<p>But resistance is necessary if I am to see the world outside my
   simplifying representations of it.

<p>So the situations I am interested in, that I push myself to find, that
   I most fear, are those that defy intuition and stymie comprehension.
   These are often occasions of acute humility.

<p>(One reason I have returned to Asia is its manifest difference. I have
   an undergraduate's hazy understanding of Orientalism, but I intuit
   that my romanticization of its difference is perhaps an example of it.
   So be it, if that's what it takes.)

<p>Traveling, I seek to be shocked into leaving. It is a goal in the same
   way that insight is a goal of meditative practice. Some of the
   koan-like paradoxes are parallel: how does one intentionally put
   oneself beyond intention? Beyond everything. Beyond home and habit.

<p>Recently, my answer has been to shut up and listen. To sit for as long
   as I can, as silently as I can.

<p>Recording in those moments, I do not capture what I witness. I do not
   witness what I record. But the recording is preserved as a sign that
   points to what I will quickly forget.

<p>Returned home, my mind filled with the everyday, I have only these
   recordings. Every once a while, I remember to listen, and slip away.
   Surrounding myself with them, I remind myself to attend to the world.

<p>Ultimately this project is about sharing these things.

<p>To listen to my recordings is not to visit the places where they were
   made. At best, though, listening creates its own occasion for leaving.

<h>addendum             

<p>It is worth contemplating that 'the shocking' does not necessarily
   shock. In Calcutta one can tour the slums. One can sample compassion,
   perhaps in penance for the license travelers otherwise grant
   themselves. Suffering does not shock.

<p>But then, when has it? In my city the landscape of human suffering is
   just as real and unreal as the juxtaposed landscape of privilege.

<p>If not the horrific, what surprises me into what I am calling leaving?

<p>I can answer only for myself: the unexpected detail and the unexpected
   kindness. The minutia of human behavior or natural phenomena visible
   only to the lucky voyeur. That which is unobserved when, as I usually
   am, I am in perpetual physical and mental motion. The revelation of
   alien patterns of assumption and expectation as deep as my own.

<p>I once explained my occasional struggle to escape the illusion of
   comprehension this way. I envision myself wearing an iron and leather
   harness. Radiating out from this harness are many branches. At the end
   of each is ensconced a burning candle.

<p>Each candle is an assumption, illuminating the world in a particular
   way I've learned. Try to see through the glare of candlelight.

<p>Darkness falls many ways. It may be thrust upon us, as on September
   11. Or, sitting still and attempting to quiet the mind, the candles
   may wink out.

<p>To be outside, in the dark, is to be at risk. There is often a psychic
   shock of dislocation. At times one may be at risk physically as well.
   I do not think that a condition of danger is guaranteed to awaken the
   mind. There is more to attention than adrenaline. One can grow as
   accustomed to most anything. The mind is a great seeker of habit, and
   finding it, remakes intuition to the new order.

<p>Finally: it is a privilege to willingly enter such a state of
   uncertainty. It is a greater one to have a home to return to. I am
   grateful for these things.
