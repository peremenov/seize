 <h>    Counseling and Therapy FAQ
 <h>    Gloria G. Brame,PhD,ACS

   
  <h>   Sensitive, non-judgmental, andconfidential counseling on sex and
   relationships.



  <h>   Counseling Philosophy

  <p>   As a sex expert (Ph.D. in Human Sexuality, M.P.H. in Human Sexuality),
   an author ("Different Loving","Come Hither", others), a
   sex-and-relationships expert (Cosmo, Maxim, GQ, Redbook, dozens of
   others), I have accumulated thousands of insights into what makes
   people tick sexually. I've worked with hundreds of individuals on sex
   and relationships, first as a peer counselor and, since 2000, as a
   licensed clinical sexologist (member, American College of
   Sexologists). As a journalist and author specializing in sex and
   relationships, I've also fielded thousands of sex questions over the
   years.

  <p>   From all that I've learned, I believe that personal happiness cannot
   come until an individual is at peace with his or her sexual identity.
   In my practice, I help clients to accept their own sexual truths and
   teach them to make the best possible life choices for themselves based
   on what they learn about themselves.

 <p>  Whether you need help building relationship skills, overcoming
   inhibitions, dealing with a sexless marriage; are coping with
   impotence, premature ejaculation, inability to orgasm,
   obsessions/addictions, medical issues or STDS; or have questions or
   concerns about gender issues, BDSM, fetishism, bisexuality, swinging,
   or other unusual sexual flavors, I will work with you to make positive
   choices.

 <p>  I pride myself in being different from other therapists in several
   ways. I don't think it's enough to be a good clinician: without
   empathy and a personal investment in the client's success, therapy can
   drag on indefinitely without results. My goal is to make myself
   unnecessary to clients - to help them get to a place where they don't
   need to speak to me every week to keep their lives in balance. I am an
   advocate for my clients' personal goals. I do not waste time and money
   on silence. I offer advice, insights, and share my own experiences
   when relevant. I view the therapy process as an opportunity for a
   client to reveal him or herself completely to someone who has both the
   skill and the commitment to identify problem areas, ask the hard
   questions, get to underlying truths, and to provide support and
   comfort when clients feel vulnerable.

 <p>  My approach to human sexuality is enlightened, upbeat, and completely
   nonjudgmental. I blend therapeutic methodologies to tailor each course
   of therapy to the individual(s). I work hard to help you help you
   forge tangible positive changes in your life and to heal from the
   past. I am incredibly proud of the progress that my clients make.
   Nearly every client who has committed to a course of therapy with me
   has achievedthe goals they set and, more often, exceeded them. I love
   "graduating" clients.

<p>   My practice is restricted to adults, age 18 and over. Couples of all
   varieties are welcome.
