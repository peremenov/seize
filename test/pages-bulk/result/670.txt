<h>Introduction

<p>Before 2000 the IUCN Red List was produced in book format. However,
   since 2000 the Red List has only been available electronically. The
   reasons for this departure are simple:
<l>The decision to incorporate plants and animals into a single Red
       List, rather than treating them separately, meant that the total
       species coverage more than doubled in 2000, and continues to
       increase with each update of the Red List.
<l>The 2000 Red List marked the start of a process to document all
       species listed. This documentation greatly increases the size but
       also the utility of the Red List.
<l>The IUCN Red List now makes better use of the electronic medium as
       it provides a wider audience with easy access to the information.
<l>The Red List is updated at least every two years and increasingly
       is updated annually, and so the production of a book for each
       update would be too prohibitive both in terms of time and cost.

<p>The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is available only as an
   electronic version on the World Wide Web. A CD-ROM version of the Red
   List was produced in 2000 and funds permitting, a new version will be
   produced in the future. The information presented is based on data
   extracted from the SSC Species Information Service (SIS) Red List
   database maintained by the IUCN SSC Red List Programme Office in
   Cambridge, UK. The information provided here covers all taxa that have
   been assigned an IUCN Red List Category with the exception of those
   designated as Not Evaluated (NE). All the assessments presented,
   except those for geographically isolated subpopulations or stocks, are
   for the taxon (species, subspecies or variety) as a whole (i.e. they
   indicate the global risk of extinction). No national or regional Red
   List assessments are included, except for national extinctions (where
   known) and an occasional note about national or sub-national status in
   one of the documentation fields.

<h>Documentation of Species

<p>The SSC Red List Programme has developed a set of minimum
   documentation requirements that were introduced in 2000. Anyone making
   submissions for inclusion on the Red List is requested to provide (in
   addition to the usual details about name, status, criteria and
   distribution) a justification to support the listing; a map of the
   extent of occurrence; a list of the major habitats the species is
   found in; what the major threats are; an indication as to whether the
   species' population trend is increasing, decreasing, stable or
   unknown; what conservation actions are in place or are needed; and
   information on the utilization of the species. Non-mandatory
   information is also collected on life history attributes, the value of
   species for human livelihoods and the importance of species to
   ecosystem processes. If the taxon assessed falls within the
   jurisdiction of an appointed Red List Authority then it will be
   referred to them for evaluation (for further details about Red List
   Authorities and how to submit assessments see theIUCN/SSC Red List
   Programme and the Red List Assessment Process).

<p>The documentation on the Detailed Results page for each taxon may
   include some or all of the following information under the headings
   indicated:

<h>Taxonomy

<l>Higher taxonomy details are shown for Kingdom, Phylum, Class,
       Order and Family.
<l>Scientific name (genus and species) including authority details
       wherever possible. (Note: for animals the date of description is
       usually shown, but for plants this is not the case).
<l>Taxonomic notes are included when there are particular problems or
       issues. These notes may also indicate taxonomic changes that will
       be made in future updates. A number of taxonomic notes also
       include generic and species synonyms.
<l>Synonyms includes names that appeared in past Red Lists that are
       no longer accepted as being correct, names that were incorrectly
       spelt in previous Red Lists (orthographic errors), or alternative
       names that are still in common use.
<l>Common names in English (E), French (F) and Spanish (S) only.
       There is no attempt to indicate any preferred common names.
<l>Under the species assessments, links are provided to any
       infra-specific assessments that may exist (i.e., subspecies,
       variety or subpopulation assessments)
<l>The Taxonomy section under the subspecies and varieties provides
       extra details on the scientific names for the taxa and their
       authority details.

<h>Assessment Information

<l>Red List Category and Criteria (only the criteria which are met
       for the highest category to which the species can be assigned are
       specifiedl). The version of the Red List Category and Criteria
       used to make the assessment is indicated. Assessments made up
       until and including 2000 used the 1994 Red List Categories and
       Criteria (ver 2.3) whereas all assessments made since 2001 use the
       2001 Red List Categories and Criteria (ver 3.1).
<l>Date of assessment (used to show the year when the assessment was
       done). Any assessments older than ten years will have an
       .out-of-date. flag. This is indicated on the web site by the
       letters .OD. in the Caveat field. The Caveat field is only present
       when there are out-of-date assessments.
<l>An indication if a petition about the status of the species has
       been lodged and is pending a decision from the Red List Standards
       and Petitions Subcommittee (see
       http://www.iucn.org/themes/ssc/redlists/petitions.html). This is
       indicated on the web site by the letter 'P' as a flag in the
       Annotation field on the initial search results page. The
       Annotation field is only present when there is a petition.
<l>The Assessors field indicates the names of the people or
       organizations responsible for making the assessment and compiling
       the information.
<l>The Evaluators field indicates the names of the people who have
       peer reviewed and accepted the assessment and the supporting
       documentation. There is always a minimum of two evaluators (these
       may overlap with the assessors) and the name of the Red List
       Authority or organization they work for is indicated.
<l>A justification for the listing (including any numerical data
       used, or inferences made, that relate to the thresholds in the
       criteria). This may include a link to a PDF file containing extra
       information.
<l>Red List History (a history of global listings for the taxon
       concerned on the IUCN Red Lists and BirdLife lists . this is a
       work in progress).

<h>Distribution

<l>Countries of occurrence and sub-country units for large countries
       and islands far from mainland countries (see below).
<l>Occurrence in marine regions and inland water bodies or systems
       (see below).

<h>Summary Documentation

<l>The major systems the species occurs in (i.e., marine, freshwater,
       terrestrial).
<l>Major habitat preferences
<l>Major threats (past, present, future, ongoing, or timing unknown).
<l>Current population trends (where [up.gif] = improving, [down.gif]
       = deteriorating, [stable.gif] = stable and [unknown.gif] =
       uncertain or don't know, while a blank indicates that this has not
       been looked at yet).
<l>Conservation actions in place and needed.
<l>The utilization of the species (this information is being captured
       but is not shown on the current version of the web site).

<h>Detailed Documentation

<l>General notes about range; population; habitat and ecology;
       threats; what conservation measures (or actions) are in place or
       needed; and comments on the utilization of the taxon. These notes
       may include links to PDF files with further supporting
       documentation.
<l>A map of the extent of occurrence (these maps are currently only
       available for the following taxa: all amphibian species; most
       threatened birds; Mediterranean reptiles and freshwater fishes;
       and selected East African freshwater fishes, molluscs and
       dragonflies).

<h>Links to Other Sources

<l>Links to other web sites that may contain further information and
       images of the taxon concerned.

<h>Data Sources

<l>The list of references (published and unpublished) used for the
       assessment and the supporting documentation.

<p>The degree of documentation achieved is extremely variable across the
   list, but an increasing number of species are meeting the minimum
   requirements. In a growing number of cases the amount of documentation
   is substantial, hence to allow users easier navigation through the
   documentation, the information described above has been grouped under
   five major headings (Summary, Distribution, Other Documentation,
   References, Comprehensive) presented as tabs across the top of each
   Detailed Results page. The Comprehensive tab provides the full
   documentation for the taxon, whereas the other tabs provide subsets of
   the information as indicated.

<p>For anyone wishing to submit a Red List assessment for inclusion on
   the Red List please see the details given under The Red List
   Assessment Process.

<h>Extinct and Extinct in the Wild Species

<p>For Extinct species (and infra-specific taxa), extra documentation is
   required indicating the effective date of extinction, the causes of
   the extinction and the details of surveys which have been conducted to
   search for the species. The starting date for the inclusion of
   extinctions was previously set at 1600 AD, but this has been moved
   back to 1500 AD to be in line with the starting date used by the
   Committee on Recently Extinct Organisms. An attempt has been made to
   collate whatever information is available on each Extinct species and
   this is presented in the various documentation fields.

<h>Subspecies, Varieties and Subpopulations

<p>Although the name IUCN Red List of Threatened Speciesimplies that the
   primary focus is at the species level, the IUCN Red List also includes
   assessments that are done at the infra-specific or subpopulation
   levels. Ideally, for such taxa to be included in the Red List, the
   global status of the species itself should be assessed. In most
   instances this is the case and generally these are assessed as Least
   Concern (LR/lc or LC). There are some cases, however, especially
   amongst the plants where this has not been done and it may well be
   that some of these species warrant a threatened status. For
   subpopulations (also called stocks), only geographically isolated
   subpopulations, between which there is little genetic exchange
   (typically one migrant individual or gamete per year), are included on
   the IUCN Red List.

<p>In the 2000 version of the Red List, all searches produced combined
   results for species, subspecies, varieties and subpopulations. In many
   cases users only wanted species-level information and if the lists
   were very long this was often difficult to extract. The default search
   options now provide results at the species level only. Searches for
   subspecies, varieties and subpopulations have to be specified
   separately. If assessments for subspecies, varieties or subpopulations
   are available, these are clearly indicated from the detailed results
   pages of the species concerned.

<h>Taxa Removed from the Red List (Synonyms)

<p>The Red List is highly dynamic with species moving on and off for a
   variety of reasons. The main reasons for removals from the list are
   changes in taxonomy. All changes are tracked, so that a complete audit
   trail is kept for each taxon name that ever appears on the Red List.
   Taxa removed from the Red List for taxonomic reasons (i.e., they are
   considered synonyms of other taxa) are searchable (searches will
   indicate the synonyms found under their accepted/correct names); and
   the synonym/s are listed on the Detailed Results page for the accepted
   taxon. The list of synonyms also includes misspellings (orthographic
   errors). It is not intended that the IUCN Red List will maintain an
   exhaustive synonymy for all taxa on the list, however, commonly used
   synonyms are often included. Any synonyms listed under the taxonomic
   notes are generally not searchable.

<h>Distribution Information:

<h>Countries and Sub-countries

<p>Distribution is recorded in terms of country names following the 5th
   edition (and subsequent web updates) of theISO-3166-1 standard (ISO
   1997). Unless geographically very remote from each other, islands and
   other territories are included with the parent country. In the case of
   species that inhabit islands significantly distant from the mainland,
   the island name is given in parentheses (e.g., Spain (Canary
   Islands)). The naming of such islands follows edition 2 of the World
   Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions (Brummitt et al.
   2001) prepared for the International Working Group on Taxonomic
   Databases (TDWG). The TDWG geographic system also provides a standard
   set of Basic Recording Units (BRU) that are sub-country units based on
   provinces or states. The BRU's are used to subdivide very large
   countries like Australia, Brazil, China, South Africa, the Russian
   Federation and the United States of America, etc. into smaller more
   conveniently sized units for recording distributions. This system has
   been adopted for the IUCN Red List wherever possible. Most plant taxa
   on the Red List have had their distributions recorded down to BRU
   level where appropriate, but unfortunately sub-country information is
   still lacking for most of the animal species. Hence this feature is
   not currently searchable. Each country or territory has also been
   assigned to a single geographic region to enable users to search by
   larger geographic areas. (View the list of Countries by Regions).

<p>Geopolitical events during recent years may have led to some
   inconsistency or errors in the distribution information provided.
   Within reasonable limits every effort has been made to determine which
   of the new nations that were part of the former Czechoslovakia,
   Yugoslavia and USSR support species previously attributed to the
   larger unit. There may be some species in the Red List that have still
   not been fully resolved. Adherence to the ISO system also creates some
   problems, as there is often a time lag between a political change and
   a new ISO code being allocated for the new country. The version of the
   ISO codes used for example, maintains Hong Kong and Macao as separate
   units.

<h>Doubtful Distributions and Vagrants

<p>The distributions of some species in certain countries have not been
   confirmed. These are indicated as possibly doubtful occurrences by the
   inclusion of a '?' after the country name. These instances are
   distinct from vagrant distributions that are usually displayed
   separately with a [vag] or [vag?] flag after the country name.But
   combinations of doubtful country occurrences and vagrants plus
   doubtful countries and dubious vagrants are also possible. So care
   should be taken when using the distribution information for subsequent
   analyses.Likewise, for a number of very widespread Least Concern taxa,
   the list of country occurrences may be incomplete or in some instances
   not even recorded (e.g., Mus musculus ) because such taxa are
   virtually cosmopolitan. Please note that the results presented in the
   published analyses of the Red List data (Baillie et al. 2004,
   Hilton-Taylor 2000), do not include questionable distribution records
   and vagrant distributions. Note that summary statistics tables do not
   include any questionable distribution recordsand records of vagrants,
   so that the results of any searches on the Red List web site should
   match the figures in the summary tables.

<h>Aquatic Distributions

<p>For marine species, country records have been provided wherever
   possible. This information has been derived from a number of sources,
   e.g. FishBase and the many FAO publications. Any species without a
   country name in the Red List is not included in any of the analyses or
   tables presented. For some marine species, especially those that are
   most strictly marine, their distributions are also shown as
   generalized ranges in terms of the FAO Fishing Areas, indicated as
   follows (e.g., Atlantic-eastern central). For many inland water
   species, usually those restricted to a single water system, inland
   water ranges are also given with a clear indication from the name if
   it is a river or a lake. In a few instances, a second river name (e.g.
   Colorado River, Concho River) indicates a section of the drainage in
   which the species occurs. In most cases, the countries in which these
   freshwater species occur are also recorded, but there are a few
   instances (e.g., cichlid fish in Lake Victoria), where the precise
   country distribution is unknown, so the only distribution information
   is the Lake name.

<h>Introductions, Reintroductions and Extinctions

<p>In most cases where a species is known to have been introduced or
   reintroduced to a country, this is indicated by an [int] or [re-int]
   after the country name in the distribution text. Note that for
   searches on threatened species in a specific country or group of
   countries, the introduced species are excluded from the results (and
   also from the summary statistics tables). Whereas a search for a
   particular threatened species, will list the countries where it has
   been introduced. Where populations are known or suspected to have been
   extirpated from a country, this is indicated by [RE] or [RE?] for
   Regionally Extinct or possibly Regionally Extinct.

<h>Subpopulations

<p>The Red List contains assessments for some stocks or geographically
   isolated subpopulations. In the 1996 Red List these were indicated by
   (S) after the species name, but this created confusion in some cases,
   so a geographic name is now given directly after the name of the
   species e.g., Balaena mysticetus (Spitsbergen stock).
