<h>Abstract

<p>Estimating the costs of health interventions is important to
   policy-makers for a number of reasons including the fact that the
   results can be used as a component in the assessment and improvement
   of their health system performance. Costs can, for example, be used to
   assess if scarce resources are being used efficiently or whether there
   is scope to reallocate them in a way that would lead to improvements
   in population health. As part of its WHO-CHOICE project, WHO has been
   developing a database on the overall costs of health interventions in
   different parts of the world as an input to discussions about priority
   setting.

<p>Programme costs, defined as costs incurred at the administrative
   levels outside the point of delivery of health care to beneficiaries,
   may comprise an important component of total costs. Cost-effectiveness
   analysis has sometimes omitted them if the main focus has been on
   personal curative interventions or on the costs of making small
   changes within the existing administrative set-up. However, this is
   not appropriate for non-personal interventions where programme costs
   are likely to comprise a substantial proportion of total costs, or for
   sectoral analysis where questions of how best to reallocate all
   existing health resources, including administrative resources, are
   being considered.

<p>This paper presents a first effort to systematically estimate
   programme costs for many health interventions in different regions of
   the world. The approach includes the quantification of resource
   inputs, choice of resource prices, and accounts for different levels
   of population coverage. By using an ingredients approach, and making
   tools available on the World Wide Web, analysts can adapt the
   programme costs reported here to their local settings. We report
   results for a selected number of health interventions and show that
   programme costs vary considerably across interventions and across
   regions, and that they can contribute substantially to the overall
   costs of interventions.

<h>Introduction

<p>Estimating the costs of health interventions is important to
   policy-makers for a number of reasons including the fact that the
   results can be used as a component in the assessment and improvement
   of the performance of their health systems. As part of its WHO-CHOICE
   cost-effectiveness work programme (go to
   http://www.who.int/evidence/cea for more details), WHO has undertaken
   an effort to assess the overall costs and effects of a wide variety of
   health interventions [1]. Single global estimates of intervention
   costs are not relevant to individual countries. On the other hand,
   very few countries are able to estimate the costs of all possible
   interventions in their settings. WHO-CHOICE is, therefore, assessing
   the costs and effects of a range of interventions for 14 epidemiologic
   sub regions of the world. The provision of sub-regional estimates
   allows interventions to be classified into broad categories for
   decision-making that have broad validity across that set of countries
   - e.g. those that are very cost-effective, those that are
   cost-effective, and those that are cost-ineffective. Policy-makers can
   then ask if there are good reasons why very cost-effective
   interventions are not done in their setting, while at the same time
   cost-ineffective interventions are being done [2]. The results will be
   presented in a way that analysts from countries in each region will be
   able to judge the appropriateness of the findings for their country
   and adapt them to their own settings. In the future, WHO-CHOICE will
   provide technical assistance to selected countries interested in
   applying the tools of generalized cost-effectiveness analyses

<p>Costs can be divided into 'patient costs' and non-patient or
   'programme costs'. Patient costs refer to all costs at the point of
   delivery such as outpatient visits, bed days, drugs, or laboratory
   tests. Programme costs include costs incurred at the administrative
   levels of the district, provincial or central-levels, i.e. the costs
   incurred at a level other than the delivery point of an intervention
   to beneficiaries. The components include such items as administration,
   training or media campaigns[3]. It is not uncommon for analysts to
   ignore programme costs when performing CEA. For example, only one [4]
   out of nine studies examining the cost-effectiveness of tuberculosis
   treatment strategies clearly showed that programme costs had been
   incorporated [5]. That study estimated the average cost of different
   ways of directly observing tuberculosis treatment as a means of
   improving adherence. For the option of completely ambulatory short
   course chemotherapy with daily supervision, programme costs accounted
   for 33%, 16% and 34% of estimated total costs in Mozambique, Malawi
   and Tanzania in turn. These findings suggest that programme costs can
   be a substantial proportion of total costs, and that the proportion
   may well vary across settings. They also mean that using a simple rule
   of thumb in which programme costs are assumed to be a fixed percentage
   of patient costs may not always be appropriate - although probably
   preferable than ignoring this category of cost completely [6,7].

<p>While most CEA guidelines recommend including all relevant costs that
   vary between programmes, studies may ignore them because they use an
   "incremental" approach to costing - comparing the introduction of a
   new technology against an existing intervention [8,9]. These studies
   are concerned with marginal changes in costs and effects; they assume
   that overhead items such as programme costs will remain approximately
   the same for each alternative being compared, and will not affect the
   choice between the given alternatives [8]. However, this is simply not
   appropriate when considering non-personal health interventions, such
   as mass media campaigns to encourage people to exercise more, where
   virtually the entire intervention consists of programme costs. Nor is
   it appropriate in many personal health interventions, such as the
   tuberculosis case described above, or when analysts are interested in
   answering the question of how best to use existing health resources to
   improve population health[10].

<p>This paper presents the systematic method for estimating programme
   costs for health interventions across settings used for WHO-CHOICE.
   The method and the resulting estimates can be used for different
   purposes, e.g. cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and other types of
   costing exercises such as estimating the costs of scaling-up
   interventions as part of the activities of such bodies as the Global
   Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The following section
   presents the methods for identifying, collecting and calculating
   programme costs, including consideration of the theoretical basis for
   calculating programme costs. The third section presents an application
   of the approach including programme cost estimates for a number of
   interventions. Conclusions are presented in the final section.

<h>Methods

<p>This section describes the methods used in calculating programme costs
   as part of WHO-CHOICE. The first part discusses the theoretical
   approach for defining relevant costs. The second and third parts
   document the methods used to determine the amount of resource use and
   their prices. The last part elucidates a means of accounting for
   different coverage levels of an intervention.

<h>Conceptual Approach

<p>Observed prices or charges do not necessarily reflect economic value.
   Generally, the economic definition of costs should be used in cost
   valuation, not the accounting (or financial) definition. This is based
   on the concept of 'opportunity cost', i.e. the value forgone by not
   utilizing the same resource in its next best alternative use [11,12].
   The concept implies that all resources consumed by an intervention
   should be valued, not just those constituting a budgetary line item.

<p>In collecting costs, several basic issues concerning the costing
   process arise. The following issues outline the approach used to
   determine costs.

<h>Joint or overhead costs

<p>Programme cost analysis to inform decisions at the sectoral level
   requires information on the costs of introducing each intervention
   singly and also in combination with other related interventions. This
   requires identifying all resources involved to establish and run each
   intervention, including the necessary overheads.

<p>The simplest way to identify intervention-specific overhead costs is
   to identify shared resources used by the different interventions and
   use joint costing rules or some basis of allocation related to the
   usage of the overhead item[8]. The percentage of time devoted to each
   individual intervention was used to allocate personnel costs and the
   share of equipment used. Similarly with buildings and vehicles, the
   proportion of intervention-specific utilization to total utilization
   was used [8,13]. This implies that the resources are divisible, or can
   be shared across interventions (e.g. it is feasible to use 0.2
   vehicles for an individual intervention). This is appropriate since
   most resources can be shared across interventions and programmes, and
   particular types of personnel, transport, and buildings can be hired
   in the short term or rented out to other users. In theory, all costs
   related to a set of evaluated interventions could be allocated.
   However, WHO-CHOICE excludes two major types of 'ongoing' costs in
   this context. First, some of the costs of central administration are
   not included - those that are part of the overall planning and
   management of the health system that are unrelated to the development
   and implementation of particular interventions aimed at improving
   health. Second, the current level of education of health professionals
   is excluded; if the skills required to deliver an intervention are
   available in the country under study, training costs to develop those
   skills are not included in the programme costs since a reallocation of
   health system resources does not affect these costs.

<h>Capacity utilization

<p>The extent to which capital and labor are used can critically
   influences unit costs [5,8]. Capacity utilization is defined as the
   proportion of the total target workload time a resource is actually
   used; for example, a computer used 5 hours in a 10 hour work day has a
   capacity utilisation of 50%. In comparing the cost-effectiveness of
   interventions, it is important to ensure that the observed differences
   are due to the intrinsic characteristics of the intervention rather
   than the extent to which capital and labor have been utilized in the
   environment in which the interventions were evaluated. WHO-CHOICE
   seeks to inform policy-makers on the optimum mix of interventions if
   health resources could be reallocated. It is not useful to perform
   this analysis by analyzing some interventions that are delivered
   inefficiently and others delivered efficiently. Therefore, for this
   analysis we report the cost-effectiveness estimates of interventions
   that are done efficiently, using 80% capacity utilization as the norm.
   This is consistent with recommendations made in CEA guidelines and
   ensures the comparability of cost-effectiveness ratios across
   interventions and settings [8,9].

<h>Ingredients approach

<p>Rather than collecting data on total expenditures, the ingredients
   approach is used. The cost of any input to a production process is the
   product of the quantity used and the value (or price) of each unit.
   The ingredients approach is useful for many reasons, the most
   important are that it allows analysts and policy-makers to validate
   the assumptions used; judge whether the estimates presented can be
   applied to their settings; and, if necessary, change some of the
   parameters to replicate the analysis for their settings [3,13,14].

<h>Classification of costs

<p>Costs are classified according to three characteristics: phase of
   implementation of the intervention, organizational level where costs
   are incurred, and nature of costs. This can be classified in the
   following three categories, with primary classifications listed first:

<l>Start-up and Post Start-up costs: Programmes incur different types
   of costs in the start-up and post-implementation phases. The
   definition of the start-up period is the time between the decision to
   implement an intervention and starting its delivery to the first
   beneficiary. Quantities are reported for the total time of the
   start-up period. If the start-up period is 18 months, the quantities
   used for the entire time are reported. Post start-up programme costs
   for the full period of implementation of the intervention were based
   on an estimate of the annual cost required to run the intervention in
   a typical post start-up year when the programme is fully implemented.

<l>Central versus Lower Levels costs: Factor inputs are classified
   according to where in the administrative and organizational level of
   the health system they are used. In this analysis we collected cost
   data from three programme-cost levels: central, provincial and
   district levels, but the data can be easily adapted to the relevant
   administrative classification in different settings.
<l>Recurrent versus Capital costs: Factor inputs are further classified
   into recurrent and capital items. Following standard practice, capital
   costs are annualized over the useful life of the factor input, i.e.
   the 'equivalent annual costs' are calculated.

<h>Discounting across time

<p>For country-specific analysis, the local rate of return on long-term
   government bonds would ideally be used as the social discount rate for
   costs. For our purposes, to allow comparability across regions, a 3 %
   discount rate was used as recommended by most guidelines [8].

<p>Total start-up costs of the programme were considered as a capital
   investment and annualized and discounted over the life of the
   programme. For country-specific analysis, the choice of the period
   over which start-up costs should be annualised would be made on a case
   by case basis, but to allow comparability for the sub regional
   analysis, 10 years was chosen as the useful life of a start-up period
   [3]. The sensitivity of the analysis to this assumption was explored
   in the individual intervention studies.

<h>Data on quantities

<p>In the period 2001-2, WHO-CHOICE invited regional expert teams
   representing countries from each of the 14 epidemiologic sub regions
   to gather the quantities of physical inputs (the ingredients) required
   for approximately 75 interventions using a standard tool (see Endnotes
   section, Note 1 for details of the data collection tools and
   procedures). Most of the ingredients were for specific interventions,
   but some were for generic cost components which could be used in a
   number of interventions - for example, the cost of training health
   workers on case management using different combinations of number of
   days, and number of participants.

<p>The data they provided were compiled and compared to form the basis of
   a set of costing sheets for the different activities covered by
   programme costs. Next, a list of required activities and the intensity
   of each activity was compiled for each intervention. For example,
   media outreach was classified into four intensities: extensive (daily
   or more radio and television emissions), moderate (weekly emissions),
   minimal (monthly emissions or less), and printed material only (for
   programmes which have some information distribution requirements).
   Further activities included basic administration, monitoring,
   evaluation, and supervision, passage of legislation, training, and law
   enforcement. Other activities relevant only to one or a few programmes
   were entered separately. Training was divided into the costs involved
   in setting-up and running a specific training session, and the costs
   of overseeing and administering a training programme. The former costs
   are considered to vary with the number of trainees and length of
   training, while the latter were considered a fixed cost needed to run
   any training programme, no matter how many trainees or the length of
   training. The use of this standardized format ensures that different
   programmes are valued consistently based on the activities needed.
   This, in turn, ensures comparability of results.

<p>Quantities were divided into fixed and variable costs. Fixed costs
   include those necessary to set up and run a programme no matter how
   many people are covered. Some examples of fixed cost include parts of
   the central administration, passage of legislation, and basic
   monitoring activities. Some examples of items that vary by the number
   of people covered include people delivering a service, the amount of
   storage space and shipment needed, supervision, and the production of
   printed information materials.

<p>The required quantities of inputs were based on the estimates by the
   regional expert teams. However, because there was missing data for
   some interventions in some regions, the quantities for the variable
   and fixed cost functions were standardized across regions for most
   interventions (this was done except in cases where difference between
   regions is clearly justifiable, such as random breath testing of motor
   vehicle drivers where significantly different traffic patterns across
   regions would result in very different needs for enforcement). Because
   of different sizes of countries within the various regions, variable
   costs obviously varied by region (this builds in economies of scale,
   where fixed costs are spread over populations of different sizes).

<p>The regional expert teams also estimated details such as the office
   supplies, equipment, and office space different staff members would
   consume in a year. Based on these assumptions, the quantities of
   utilities used and maintenance costs were also estimated (further
   details can be found at http://www.who.int/evidence/cea). Within the
   broad categories outlined in the conceptual approach section, inputs
   were classified in the manner reported in Table 1.

<h>Data on prices

<p>This analysis requires the unit prices used to reflect the economic
   cost of goods, and allow for inter-country comparison of costs of
   interventions. For this purpose, the world price level was chosen as
   the numeraire or price level [11], and a reference currency, i.e., the
   International Dollar (I$), was chosen for the presentation of the
   results at the international level. Costs in local country currency
   units were converted to international dollars using purchasing power
   parity (PPP) exchange rates. A PPP exchange rate is the number of
   units of a country's currency required to buy the same amounts of
   goods and services in the domestic market of a reference country, in
   this case the United States. An international dollar is, therefore, a
   hypothetical currency that is used as a means of translating and
   comparing costs from one country to the other. Because published
   estimates of PPPs do not cover all 192 countries that are members of
   WHO, the PPP exchange rates used in this analysis were developed by
   WHO and are available on the WHO-CHOICE website.

<h>Prices for traded goods

<p>Traded goods are commodities that are available on the international
   market, and all countries can purchase them at an international market
   price. Since the international market price reflects the opportunity
   cost of using a good to the country, it is used as the price for
   traded goods, adjusted to include cost, insurance and freight (c.i.f.)
   for imported goods and free on board (f.o.b.) for exported goods.

<p>International prices were derived from price indexes compiled in WHO
   publications and catalogues of prices from firms and non-governmental
   organizations operating at an international level that excluded costs
   of shipment and taxes. These international values were placed in a
   common currency (year 2000 I$) using World Bank Gross Domestic Product
   (GDP) deflators, or, when GDP deflators were unavailable, Consumer
   Price Index deflators [15].

<p>Generally, for small items that can be bought in bulk, the lowest
   internationally listed price was selected. This assumes the existence
   of a basic health infrastructure, enabling the purchase of items in
   bulk. For larger items, a middle level price was selected to represent
   a "typical" price. In some cases, the price range for a good was too
   big to justify the use of a mid-level price. For example, a given
   model of a four-wheel-drive vehicle can range in price from US$15,000
   to US$25,000. Thus, for vehicle prices, generators, and other large
   cost items, the regional expert teams were asked to provide the local
   price of goods excluding taxes and subsidies.

<p>The f.o.b. (free-on-board) price of exports includes the production
   cost, transport costs, local marketing costs and local port charges of
   the exporting country [16]. The c.i.f. (cost-insurance-freight) price
   excludes import duties and subsidies (transfer payments), and includes
   the selling price of the producing country, freight, insurance, and
   unloading charges. If a country imports the good, the costs of local
   transport and distribution (termed 'domestic margin') were added to
   the c.i.f. price in order to approximate the local opportunity cost
   [16]. Methods for calculating c.i.f./f.o.b. adjustments are discussed
   in the section on coverage levels.

<h>Prices for non-traded goods

<p>Prices of non-traded goods like labour vary across regions. The
   regional expert teams provided local prices for non-traded goods for
   reference countries in their regions. Where possible, supplementary
   information from other sources on country-specific prices of
   non-traded goods, such as the International Labour Organization (ILO)
   database on occupational salaries, was also used to determine a
   typical cost for the region as a whole.

<h>Coverage Levels

<p>As coverage expands into remote areas, the marginal costs of providing
   an intervention to each additional person will generally increase
   [17-19]. To account for the increasing marginal costs of
   transportation to more remote areas, the following methods were used
   to adjust costs for different levels of population coverage.
   Transportation costs consist of the cost of transporting goods to a
   country (c.i.f./f.o.b.) and transporting goods within a country (the
   domestic margin).

<h>Adjusting prices for traded goods

<p>The calculation of the cost of transportation was based on the only
   available study showing the percentage change in the price of a traded
   good based on the distance it travels between countries, the
   transportation infrastructure and the average GDP per capita of a
   country, and other variables relating to the availability of seaports,
   neighbouring trade partners, etc. [20]. For purposes of calculating
   the c.i.f./f.o.b. mark-up of goods, an infrastructure index was
   calculated and applied using the price elasticity coefficients
   reported in Limão and Venables [21]. Table 2 illustrates the results
   of this analysis for selected countries in different regions with the
   c.i.f./f.o.b. mark-up ranging from 1.16 (16% increase in price) in
   Denmark to 1.71 in Afghanistan, with a median mark-up of 1.28.

<p>The domestic margin was calculated based on a hexagon shaped regional
   distribution model [22]. Each hexagon was assumed to cover 80 square
   kilometres, approximating the area served by one health centre
   reflecting a circular area with a radius of 5 km [23]. The population
   of each hexagon was derived from Geographical Information System (GIS)
   data on the population density of a country. In this model, the
   population density of the most crowded 80 square kilometres is assumed
   to be at the centre of the country, with hexagons further from the
   centre having progressively lower population densities. Thus, in the
   case of Burkina Faso, 4% of the population is assumed to live in the
   central hexagon, while only 2% of the population is assumed to live in
   the adjacent hexagon.

<p>Each country is also divided into provinces and districts based on the
   number of provinces and districts reported by WHO databases. In cases
   where the number of secondary or tertiary administrative units was not
   certain, an average was taken from the available sources. The average
   size of a province or district was calculated by dividing the total
   area of a country by the number of provinces or districts, which were
   then incorporated into the hexagonal grid. A traded good was assumed
   to travel, on average, half the distance from the central hexagon to
   the centre of the most peripheral province, and then to the centre of
   a district. The Limão and Venables price elasticity for distance was
   then used with this calculated distance to derive the domestic margin.
   Since, in this model, the central areas are more crowded than outlying
   areas, a programme covering 50% of the population will have a
   proportionately lower mark-up than a programme covering 95% of the
   population. However, as shown in Table 2, the domestic margin is a
   minor cost compared to the cost of initially transporting a good to
   the country.

<h>Impact on resource utilization

<p>When an intervention covers a larger part of the population, the
   resources required to run the intervention also increase. As coverage
   goes up, certain cost parameter values were increased as follows:

<l>As indicated above, the hexagon shaped regional distribution model
   assumes a health centre for every 80 square kilometres of space. This
   implies that health centres may not always run at 80% capacity, since
   more remote areas may have a very low population density. Since costs
   of training of health care professionals are independent of population
   density, these costs - expressed as costs per capita - will increase
   as coverage levels increase

<l>The number of provinces covered increases as coverage expands. Under
   the assumptions listed above, one or two provinces may contain 50% or
   more of the population. Thus, as coverage expands, the number of
   provinces covered will increase, but each new province covered will
   have fewer people. Since there are fixed costs associated with running
   a programme at the province level, this produces diseconomies of
   scale.

<l>The distance travelled in a supervision visit increases. At the
   national level, this is calculated as the distance from the centre to
   the most remote province covered (the average distance would be half
   the distance from the center to the periphery; however, because
   supervision visits are assumed to be round trips, the full distance
   from the center to the periphery is used). The distance travelled for
   supervision visits within provinces is similarly calculated.

<l>Thus, the number of programme staff involved in supervision
   activities needs to increase both in proportion to the increased
   distances covered and to account for the increased number of
   provinces. Each province was assumed to need an equal number of
   supervision visits.

<p>It is possible that salaries may be higher in very remote areas to
   give health personnel extra incentive to relocate to these areas. In
   the absence of data, this factor was not incorporated.

<h>Organising and using the data

<p>The predicted quantities of resources needed were multiplied by their
   respective prices to calculate the total programme costs for a
   ten-year period of implementation. These ten-year costs are calculated
   in year 2000 international dollars using a standard net present value
   formula [8].

<h>Validation

<p>Once the data had been collected and analysed, the accuracy of the
   data was verified. Where possible, previous costing or CE studies
   which included programme costs were used as a benchmark for
   comparison, but very few presented programme cost estimates using the
   ingredients approach (e.g. [24]). In addition, disease and public
   health experts or programme managers who are familiar with the
   particular interventions and settings for a number of diseases
   reviewed the final costing figures. In the cases where the estimates
   did not have face validity, controls were made to ensure that there
   had not been mistakes with coding, and discussions were held with the
   regional costing experts to confirm the basis of their quantity and
   price estimates.

<h>Results
 
<p>WHO-CHOICE has used the methods described above to produce a set of
   cost-effectiveness estimates, initially for 14 epidemiologic sub
   regions [25]. Table 3 reports the average annual programme cost per
   capita, and as a percentage of total intervention cost per capita, for
   selected interventions in these regions. Costs are presented in 2000
   International dollars. The table shows that programme costs vary
   across interventions and across regions for a given intervention. For
   example, cost per capita of educating sex workers totals I$ 0.01 in
   SearB, whereas it amounts to $0.07 in AfrE. For a population of 100
   million people, this would mean programme costs differ substantially -
   $1 million in the former and $7 million in the latter sub region.
   Variations are caused by differences in the number of sex workers and
   in the number of social workers required to train sex worker peer
   educators, and to differences in regional price levels of inputs.
   (Note also that a straight comparison of cost per capita across
   interventions is misleading in deciding whether an intervention is of
   low cost or more expensive at a population level, because there is
   wide variation in the target populations for each of these
   interventions.)

<p>The importance of programme cost in comparison with patient cost also
   varies by intervention and by region. Obviously, non-personal
   interventions such as the introduction of random breath testing for
   drivers to reduce the burden of motor vehicle accidents consists
   entirely of programme costs. On the other hand, the provision of brief
   physician advice to heavy alcohol users consists largely of patient
   costs, with programme costs ranging from less than 1% of total costs
   to almost 30%.

<p>The tools used to estimate these results are available on the Internet
   at http://www.who.int/evidence/cea for use by local analysts. They
   include:

<l>a database of prices for traded goods,

<l>a database listing the reported useful life of capital goods,

<l>a workbook listing activities used in programme costs together with
   assumptions of quantities of resources used based on the data
   collected by WHO, and

<l>a costing tool CostIt^© to calculate and present the final results
   of the costing exercise.

<l>a tool for uncertainty analysis MCLeague^© to calculate uncertainty
   regions around cost-effectiveness ratios and present stochastic league
   tables.

<p>All of the estimates presented could be modified by analysts to suit
   the particularities of their own setting. In adapting these tools,
   analysts have to assess if the assumptions outlined in this paper are
   appropriate for their own setting. The following list highlights some
   major considerations:

<l>Local analysts may wish to carry out the analysis using a capacity
   utilization rate other than 80% to better reflect their actual
   situation. However, one standard rate should be used for the
   evaluation of all interventions to ensure comparability. The CostIt^©
   tool allows this to be done automatically.

<l>Local analyst may wish to use local prices rather than international
   prices as estimated by WHO-CHOICE. Analyst can also vary prices for
   non-traded goods according to the location within the country where
   they are incurred; for example, provincial staff may have lower
   salaries than staff in the capital city, or vice-versa.

<l>The spatial model for scaling-up can be revised to the geography of
   a particular country. For example, multiple points of entry for traded
   goods can be considered. Alternatively, local analysts may be able to
   gather data on the prices of goods in various parts of the country, or
   the costs of transportation, and thus not need to employ the model as
   used by WHO-CHOICE. Further, the assumption that the number of
   provinces expands with increasing population coverage may not
   accurately reflect how a country implements health interventions, and
   analysts should adjust their assumptions accordingly. Finally, the
   coverage area of health centres can be determined locally.

<h>Conclusion


<p>Programme costs can constitute a substantial component of costs even
   for personal health interventions and should not be ignored in the
   economic evaluation of health interventions. This paper has presented
   a first effort to systematically analyze programme costs in different
   sub regions of the world. The use of a standardized methodology
   ensures comparability of cost estimates across interventions and
   settings.

<p>In addition, this paper has introduced "ready-to-use" tools and
   programme cost estimates that are available on the World Wide Web. The
   programme cost estimates constitute an important part of WHO-CHOICE
   database on costs and effects of multiple interventions in various
   regions in the world exploring the question of whether resources are
   being used to achieve the maximum possible level of population health.
   Analysts may wish to adapt the regional estimates to their local
   setting to make the results more relevant for local decision makers.
   This paper has shown that, in this process, special attention should
   be paid to issues such as capacity utilization, prices of goods, and
   increasing marginal costs of delivering interventions into more remote
   areas.

<p>As with any innovative work, there are some limitations to the
   approach that has been used, which offers possibilities of further
   development over time. For example, in the consultation process with
   regional expert teams to obtain input quantities and prices,
   considerable efforts were made to standardize reporting approaches.
   Nevertheless, reported quantities still showed considerable variation
   beyond that reasonably expected on the basis of regional differences,
   and it was necessary to return to the experts for clarification and to
   seek the input of external data sources and expert advice. Analysts
   wishing to adapt the results to their own settings should be aware
   that they would need to seek the advice of more than one expert in
   their own countries before adapting the quantities of inputs and unit
   prices reported here. WHO-CHOICE incorporates extensive efforts to
   develop methods for uncertainty analysis, to reflect uncertainty in
   the final cost and cost-effectiveness estimates. This is designed to
   help local policy makers decide the extent to which the results of the
   WHO-CHOICE analysis inform policy in their countries [26,27].

<p>A key element in our approach is the specification of intervention
   cost functions at various coverage levels. Whereas other studies have
   estimated costs of scaling-up health services using a linear cost
   function, the present study includes non-linearities [28]. Economies
   of scale have been incorporated by allowing some costs to be fixed
   regardless of the size of the population reached - television
   broadcasts are a case in point. On the other hand, diseconomies of
   scale have been included by using higher prices (for transport costs)
   and higher quantities (for training and supervision) at higher
   coverage levels. This is an important step for showing the impact of
   higher coverage on costs and outcomes. However, further work is
   required to add non-spatial determinants of increasing costs relating
   to scaling-up.

<h>Endnote section

<h>Note 1

<p>WHO-CHOICE instructed the costing experts on data gathering
   techniques. Each was given a standardised collecting tool and a
   guideline, and most attended a workshop detailing the methods to be
   used. The standardized data collection tool involved two Microsoft
   Excel spreadsheets. The first, the "general information" sheet,
   documents general health system parameters of a country. This sheet
   contains five tables, some for use in determining patient costs, some
   for use in determining programme costs. The second spreadsheet
   provided a template for recording the quantities of resource inputs
   for each intervention (see Table 1). A WHO-CHOICE team member made a
   follow-up visit to each country to determine the adequacy of the
   experts' techniques, answer questions, and provide further guidance.
   Responses were checked against those of other experts, as well as the
   literature, allowing outliers to be identified and the sources of any
   difference to be explored and corrected if necessary.
