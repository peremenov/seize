Frequently Asked Questions

<h>What is Land Tax?

<p>Land Tax is an annual tax based on land ownership and usage of land as
   at 30 June. Revenue from Land Tax is paid into the general revenue
   account of the South Australian Government, and assists in the
   provision of public services such as education, health and public
   safety.

<h>Who is liable for the payment of Land Tax?

<p>The owner of the property as at 30 June is liable to pay the land tax
   assessed for the new financial year. The owner is generally taken to
   be the person whose name appears on the Certificate of Title at the
   Land Titles Office.

<p>As Land Tax is calculated as at 30 June, the Notice for Payment will
   contain details of properties owned as at that time. Where a property
   was sold after 30 June, the vendor (seller) is still liable for the
   land tax. However, it should be noted, if the Land Tax is not paid at
   settlement it remains a first charge on the land and may be passed on
   to the purchaser.

<p>It is an industry based convention for the legal real estate contract
   to provide for land tax to be apportioned (based on a calculation of
   the single holding tax see single and multiple holding tax ) between
   the buyer and seller of land.

<h>How is Land Tax calculated?

<p>The Land Tax Notice for Payment is calculated on the basis of the
   total site value of all land owned (either solely or jointly) as at
   midnight 30 June, excluding exempt land. (see what land is exempt from
   land tax)

<p>It should be noted that where an owner owns more than one taxable
   property, land tax is calculated on the total site value of all
   properties owned. (For examples of calculation of land tax, see single
   and multiple holding tax).

<h>What are the Land Tax Rates?

<p>Land tax is calculated according to the following:

<h>Single and Multiple Holding Tax

<p>The terms "single holding" and "multiple holding" refer to the
   apportionment of land tax amongst taxable properties within an
   ownership.

<p>Single holding tax refers to the calculation of land tax where there
   is only one taxable property in the ownership (see example below):

<p>Multiple holding tax refers to where more than one non-exempt property
   is owned. RevenueSA is required to apportion the total land tax
   payable to each taxable property within the ownership. The total land
   tax payable is therefore apportioned amongst each of the taxable
   properties in the ownership based on their value as a proportion of
   the total site value of the ownership. (see example below):
   Example - more than one non-exempt land holding

<p>Where land is sold and adjustments are made to account for land tax
   (see who is liable for the payment of land tax) the calculation of
   land tax to be apportioned between the seller and buyer must be based
   on the calculation of a single holding tax for the property concerned.
   By using the single holding tax, the adjustment is calculated as if
   the property being sold is the only taxable property in the ownership.

<p>Why this may be your first Land Tax account
<l>The total site value of all taxable land owned by you as at 30
       June may have exceeded the general threshold level of $110,000 for
       the first time;
<l>You may have bought additional land, or your land has been
       revalued in the last financial year;
<l>Land previously exempt may now no longer satisfy the exemption
       criteria.

<h>What land is exempt from Land Tax?

<h>Principal Place of Residence Exemptions:
<p>Land that is owned by a natural person and is used as their principal
   place of residence as at 30 June is exempt. A land tax exemption is
   available to natural person's for the land on which their principal
   family home is situated (caravans or tents are not regarded as a
   principal place of residence).

<p>Properties that are the owner's principal place of residence and a
   business is run from the premises may also be eligible for a partial
   exemption provided that:
<l>one of the registered owners lived at the property on 30 June;
<l>buildings on the land have a predominantly residential character;
       and
<l>no more than 75% of the floor area of all the buildings are used
       for business purposes.

<p>A 'natural person', means an individual and does not include a company
   (or other body), which is classed as an artificial person. The
   principal place of residence exemption is not available for companies
   or other organisations, even if the land is occupied by any of its
   shareholders or members.

<p>Land Tax relief may be provided under the following three scenarios:
<l>Where a person as at 30 June owns a property subject to land tax
       and occupies this property during the new financial year as their
       principal place of residence e.g., construction of a residence on
       vacant land. Application Form 
<l>Where a person is in the process of selling a home and as a result
       owns 2 properties as at 30 June, one of which is the current
       principal place of residence (and eligible for exemption) and the
       other is intended but not yet occupied principal place of
       residence (and liable for land tax). Application Form 
<l>Where a person purchases a property, which was taxable in the
       ownership of the vendor (seller) and is to be occupied as a
       principal place of residence, the purchaser may be refunded any
       proportionate land tax paid as part of settlement. Application
       Form 

<p>It should be noted that:
<l>Unless the Commissioner otherwise allows, no rental income can be
       received from properties during the period that homes are owned
       concurrently and the former residence must be sold before the end
       of the financial year.
<l>Land Tax assessed will still be payable if the property was not
       your principal place of residence on or before the due date of
       your Notice for Payment.

<p>If you would like to apply for exemption under any of the above
   scenarios, please download and complete an applicable Application Form
   and return it to RevenueSA. Please note all Applications must be
   submitted by 30 September of the year following the year of
   assessment.

<h>Other Exemptions
<p>Exemptions are also available where land is used for the following
   purposes;
<l>Land which is used wholly or mainly for primary production
       purposes and primary production is the owner's main business;
<l>Land which is used wholly or mainly for religious or educational
       purposes;
<l>Land which is used for non-profit associations for the purpose of
       recreation for the local community, the preservation of buildings,
       the holding of agricultural shows or other specified purposes
       (charitable or sporting purposes).

<p>Applications for these other exemptions must be submitted in writing
   and forwarded to RevenueSA.

<h>Does GST apply to land tax?

<p>Land Tax is included in the Federal Treasurer's determination under
   section 81.5 of A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act, 1999
   and is NOT subject to GST.

<h>How do I pay my Land Tax Notice?

<p>Details of the payment methods available are listed on our payments
   page.

<h>Penalties and Legal Action

<p>If your account is not paid by the due date, interest and penalties
   will be imposed on the unpaid tax.

<p>If the tax and penalty then remains unpaid, legal action may be
   commenced without further notice and you may be liable for any costs
   incurred.

<h>How is the value of my land assessed?

<p>The land/site value is determined by the Valuer-General. If the site
   value on the account differs from the previous year, it will be as a
   result of a revaluation by the State Valuation Office.

<p>Formal objections regarding the valuations must be in writing served
   personally or by post to the State Valuation Office. Objections must
   be lodged within 60 days after the date of service of the first Notice
   served.
<h>PLEASE NOTE:
<l>The 60-day objection period starts at the date of the first Notice
       received. If you receive  further Notices under the Land Tax Act,
       1936, the objection period does not change.
<l>You may not object to the valuation if the Valuer-General has
       already considered an  objection by you in response to another
       rating authority for this financial year.

<p>All queries and objections regarding the valuation of your land,
   should be directed to:

<h>What should I do if my Notice is wrong?

<p>If you think your Land Tax Notice for Payment is incorrect in any way,
   please return it to RevenueSA with an explanation of the amendments
   required. Please provide a daytime contact and telephone number in
   order to process your enquiry promptly.

<p>If you lodge an objection, your Land Tax Notice should still be paid
   in accordance with the due date shown thereon - any reduction in Land
   Tax resulting from the objection will be provided by way of refund.

<h>Trusts

<p>Where a property is owned by an individual or organisation on behalf
   of a trust, the owner(s) (trustees) can apply to have that property
   assessed separately from other land owned by the trustee in another
   capacity.
<p>To apply, please provide this Office with:Â·
<l>A letter advising which property is owned on behalf of the trust.
<l>A stamped copy of the relevant trust deed in its entirety.

       trust.This can be in the form of a stamped transfer document,
       settlement statement, minutes of the Trust meeting, contract for
       sale or financial statements of the trust. If financial statements
       are supplied the statements should identify that the property is
       an asset of the trust.
