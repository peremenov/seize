<h>Official suggests euthanizing horses

<p>Unadoptable animals should be killed to control the wild horse
   population, a federal agency chief says.

<p>The national director of the Bureau of Land Management said
   Monday euthanasia may be an effective way to rid the West of
   unadoptable wild horses.
<p>"I'm not about to take horses off the range and put them in
   corrals and pay $3 a day to take care of them," BLM Director Pat Shea
   said.
<p>The BLM feeds 5,000 wild horses in adoption holding facilities
   in the West, including 2,000 in Palomino Valley, north of Reno. An
   additional 1,500 unadoptable horses -- including more than 500 taken
   last year off the Nellis Air Force Base range -- graze at a sanctuary
   north of Oklahoma City.
<p>But some of the captured animals are toothless and starving
   slowly to death because they cannot eat enough to survive, said Tom
   Pogacnik, chief of the national Wild Horse and Burro Adoption Program.
   He also said some horses cannot be adopted because of their
   temperament and bad looks.
<p>Shea partly blamed the surplus of horses on a lack of money to
   get them adopted. His agency received $17 million from Congress in its
   current budget for the wild horse adoption program. It had sought
   $19.5 million.
<p>"If Congress is not going to give us money to adopt them, then
   we have to find alternative means," he said.
<p>Under a 1971 federal law, wild horses and burros are considered
   living symbols of Western heritage and are protected. But the law also
   allows the BLM to dispose of sick, lame or old animals.
<p>Shea gave his views during a break at the first meeting of the
   reorganized National Wild Horse and Burro Advisory Committee. Members
   are spending three days this week in Nevada, including today when they
   will watch a horse roundup near Lovelock.
<p>If the advisory committee recommended euthanasia as an option,
   then Shea said he would take the message to Congress, which would have
   to change the law.
<p>"I oppose wholesale slaughter," Shea said. But "the image of
   horses without teeth gradually starving to death isn't in anybody's
   interest."
<p>Pogacnik said horse adoptions dropped this past year partly
   because of reports that many horses carry diseases and an Associated
   Press investigation. The news agency reported that thousands of wild
   horses ended up in slaughterhouses because BLM was not properly
   monitoring the program.
<p>Citizens can adopt up to four wild horses for $125 each. After a
   year, they are given title to the animals.
<p>About 43,000 wild horses are found in the West. More than half
   live in Nevada.
<p>Shea, however, questions the accuracy of horse census surveys
   and said the number of horses may be much higher.
<p>Pogacnik told the advisory committee his agency has determined
   27,000 horses would be the appropriate management level.
<p>Wild horses are rounded up and taken off public lands because
   surveys have shown they have overgrazed the range in some areas. The
   BLM conducts emergency roundups at places such as Nellis because
   animals there suffered through periods of extended drought.
<p>Wild horses also compete with livestock for forage, and the BLM
   strives to balance the interests of the wild horses with the interest
   of livestock owners.
<p>The idea that unadoptable horses should be euthanized was
   embraced quickly by Fred Burke, a rancher and advisory board member
   from Wickenburg, Ariz.
<p>"We need to do the best for the animals," Burke said. "We need
   to put them down, preferably at a rendering plant where the BLM can
   receive some money."
<p>Burke was a member of the last wild horse and burro advisory
   board that in 1992 recommended euthanasia as an option for disposal of
   unadoptable horses The recommendation was not adopted.
<p>Before taking a step toward euthanasia, Shea said, the BLM needs
   to market better its adoption program and to evaluate birth control
   methods for the wild horses.
<p>Board member Naomi Tyler, a wild horse owner from Boise, Idaho,
   called wild horses "legends" that should be kept alive. Tyler said she
   adopted a wild horse that no one one else wanted. The horse in 1990
   became the national endurance champion.
<p>She also said the demand for wild horses in Idaho is high, but
   her state does not accept wild horses rounded up in other states.
<p>"The demand is there," Tyler said. "Let's not treat these
   animals as rodents."
