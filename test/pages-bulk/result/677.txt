<h>Underground partnership

<p>Think all fungi are bad? Not the ones that have been pairing up with
   plant roots for 500 million years. Now available at garden centres,
   these can greatly benefit your plants, explains Jon Ardle

<p>The fine white
   strands (hyphae) of fungal tissue are supplying the roots they have
   colonised with water and nutrients. Formulations containing such fungi
   are now available in easy-to-use powdered form

<p>It is probably fair to say that, to most gardeners, fungi are an
   anathema. Whether turning the leaves of roses yellow and black,
   appearing in rings in a manicured lawn or, horror of horrors, as
   Armillaria (honey fungus) rampaging through a garden's trees, moulds
   are costly nightmares.

<p>Think again. In the wild, more than 95 percent of higher plant species
   not only harbour fungi in their roots, they actually supply them with
   sugars and other foods. In return, the fungi furnish the plants with
   raw materials - water and nutrients from which food substances are
   synthesised - and protect them from soil-borne diseases. The
   relationship is therefore of benefit to both: a symbiosis.

<p>The close association of the roots of trees with certain fungi was
   described as long ago as 1885, by German forester AB Frank. The name
   for the association, mycorrhiza, literally means `fungus root'. It is
   only within the last 30 years, however, that scientists have begun to
   realise that far from being the exception, such relationships are
   actually the norm in the plant kingdom.

<p>The fungal partner's network of thin tubes, or hyphae, are much more
   efficient at absorbing both water and nutrients than even the thinnest
   root hairs, as hyphae have a much bigger surface area. Under
   less-than-ideal conditions, studies have shown that the efficiency of
   mycorrhizal roots can make the difference between life and death.
   Plants with mycorrhizal root systems are better able to resist
   stresses such as drought, heat, and even diseases - many mycorrhizal
   fungi secrete antibiotics, protecting roots from pathogenic fungi such
   as Phytophthora and Armillaria, nematodes and bacteria.

<h>Structures and functions

<p>There are two main types of mycorrhizal fungi, associated with
   different plant species. On trees, the most common type is known as
   ectomycorrhizae or EM, as most of its structure is outside the root,
   often forming a visible sheath over its surface. Hyphae also grow
   inside the root between the cells, forming a characteristic structure
   known as a Hartig net, and most EM fungi also produce fruiting
   structures like mushrooms and puffballs.

<p>The other major type, endomycorrhizae, have most of their structure
   inside the root. Also known as arbuscular mycorrhizae or AM, these are
   more primitive fungi than the EM type, making up only 150 of the
   estimated 6,000 mycorrhizal fungi species. However, AM is the
   predominant type, found on 65 percent of plant families, including
   grasses, herbaceous plants and woody species, with most colonising a
   wide range of plants. The branches of the tree-like structures - the
   arbuscules - that AM fungi produce have a large surface area across
   which the plant and fungus can exchange substances to the benefit of
   both. This occurs inside the root but outside individual cell
   membranes.

<p>Their microscopic structure makes AM fungi difficult to see and they
   do not form above-ground fruiting bodies, but more than 90 percent of
   vascular plants are thought to associate regularly with them. They
   send out thin hyphae into the soil that actively mobilise nutrients
   (particularly insoluble phosphates that are often the limiting factor
   in plant growth) from dead organic material and the soil's mineral
   fraction.

<h>Working with nature

<p>The early attempts of forestry researchers to inoculate young trees
   with mycorrhizal fungi of the EM type involved macerating and
   liquidising the root systems of `donor' trees, and dipping seedling
   root systems into the slurry. Results were patchy, and such
   preparations had short shelf lives.

<p>In the 1980s, EM mycorrhizal fungi were finally cultured on a
   commercial scale without host roots, and induced to form spores. A
   company called Plant Health Care in the USA was one of the first to
   offer a viable mycorrhizal inoculant, based on the species Pisolithus
   tinctorius, found on more than 100 species of trees and shrubs
   worldwide. Trials by the company produced increased growth rates of up
   to 200 percent in the seedlings of several pine species.

<p>Since then, research has continued apace with more species cultured,
   including the more difficult AM species that are obligate symbionts
   (they only grow on host roots). Companies such as PlantWorks in Kent
   are now producing formulations increasingly tailored to different host
   species and soil conditions. Many of these now contain both AM and EM
   fungi, making them suitable for a wide range of plants. These are
   beginning to appear in garden centres, but how useful are they to home
   gardeners?

<p>The short answer is: it varies, depending on the site, conditions and
   plants grown. For plants on poor, disturbed or contaminated soils,
   mycorrhizal inoculation can be vital. On the Betteshanger Colliery
   shale deposits in Kent, a study by Christ Church College Canterbury
   and PlantWorks showed that inoculated birch seedlings had mortality
   rates of less than 3 percent, compared with 60 percent in untreated
   plants.

<p>Mycorrhizal fungi dislike disturbed ground and are not found in
   subsoil, so in areas such as gardens of new-build houses or recent
   landscaping they are often not present and may not appear naturally
   until too late for newly-planted seedlings. Simply digging over beds
   or hoeing in a garden can disrupt existing mycorrhizal relationships.

<p>A cycle of negative feedbacks is common in gardens: disturbance
   damages the fungal partners of plants, making them less able to absorb
   nutrients, so the gardener adds a chemical `fix' of inorganic
   fertiliser, which is toxic to the fungi, making them even less able to
   supply the plant.

<p>In organically-managed gardens and areas cultivated for wildlife
   interest, in particular, it makes sense to encourage mycorrhizal
   growth with early inoculation, minimal digging and mulching with
   organic matter that the fungi can break down slowly and naturally
   rather than using chemical fertilisers. Plants in such regimes are
   much better equipped to resist stresses such as drought, disease and
   excess heat - all of which may become increasingly important as global
   warming seems set to accelerate.

<h>Application

<p>A gel-based root-dip formulation containing both
   AM and EM mycorrhizal fungi used in the planting of new woods at RHS
   Garden Hyde Hall.

<p>Mycorrhizal fungi are most effective in fine, actively growing fibrous
   roots, so the initial problem is physically how to introduce the
   fungus to these parts of the plant. The simplest method, now
   well-established in forestry and landscaping, is to apply a solution
   containing the inoculant by dipping the roots in a liquid or gel
   formulation (pictured, right). This technique is only really suitable
   for dormant, bare-root woody plants.

<p>For pot-grown plants, tablets or powdered formulations can be mixed
   into the growing medium. The nursery industry has been quite slow to
   take up this method, probably because plants grown in sterile media
   and supplied with all their water and nutrient needs may show little
   extra growth after inoculation. While large growth increases have been
   found in some cases, results have been mixed. Generally, though,
   inoculated plants rarely if ever perform worse than those that have
   been left untreated.

<p>Treated, pot-grown stock, when planted out and exposed to soil
   pathogens for the first time, has been shown to establish more quickly
   with better disease-resistance, and thus suffer less from `transplant
   shock'.

<h>Terravention

<p>Terravention can both reduce soil compaction and
   inoculate trees with mycorrhizal fungi.

<p>Well-established plants including mature trees can also be inoculated,
   using a system known as Terravention. This physically blasts fungal
   inoculants into the rootball using pressurised nitrogen gas, and is
   particularly valuable in areas that are suffering from soil
   compaction, as the gas opens up air channels to some depth. The Royal
   Botanic Gardens, Kew reversed the seemingly-terminal decline of
   several specimens, including some of its oldest trees, with
   Terravention. A Platanus orientalis planted in the original garden in
   1761 and a Sophora japonica from 1762 were both re-invigorated by
   Terravention in 1997, and a Cedrus deodara, marked for removal since
   two-thirds of its crown was completely defoliated, greened-up within
   months of treatment. All three continue to recover well.

<p>Success at Kew has been repeated at The Savill Garden, Windsor. Keeper
   of the Garden Mark Flanagan reports positive results from Terravention
   treatment to six important, ancient trees that were formerly in
   decline at Frogmore, near Windsor Castle. The Savill Garden, like Kew,
   is now inoculating some seedlings routinely at the pricking-out stage.

<p>How much of the improvement shown by such venerable specimens is due
   to the soil being better aerated, and how much to the introduction of
   fungi, is difficult to quantify. The method works, and has been used
   at RHS Garden Hyde Hall (see below).

<p>Mycorrhizal inoculation is not suited to every garden situation, and a
   few plant families, notably poppies and brassicas, rarely if ever form
   such relationships. For well-fed, well-watered plants, it may be
   unnecessary, but in many cases mycorrhizal fungi can act both as
   growth promoters and insurance policies against sources of stress
   (including diseases), contributing to a more natural,
   low-intervention, ecological form of gardening.

<h>Mycorrhizae at RHS Gardens

<p>At RHS Garden Hyde Hall in Essex, mycorrhizae-based formulations have
   been used in a number of ways. The garden suffered badly from
   waterlogging during much of 2000, so Terravention with inoculation was
   tried on several of the garden's trees that had been badly affected.
   Many including a Lebanon cedar, a bird cherry and a venerable willow
   seem to have benefited.

<p>`They certainly look a lot healthier,' says Curator Matthew Wilson,
   `but it's impossible to say if this is the fungi, decompaction,
   weather or all three.' Attempting to quantify the benefits of
   mycorrhizal inoculation is inherently difficult because so many other
   factors affect the plant-fungus relationship. The best results with
   mature trees have been recorded at both the New York Botanic Gardens
   and Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew where Terravention has been combined
   with turf removal under the trees out to their driplines, and the
   exposed soil has been mulched heavily.

<p>Root dips have been used in the planting of Hyde Hall's new woodland
   areas, with treated and non-treated seedlings planted to compare
   establishment and growth. Matthew describes the results as
   `encouraging', but stresses it is too early to draw conclusions. A
   recent study at RHS Garden Wisley, comparing the effect of extra
   fertiliser and endomycorrhizal fungi on the resistance of Fragaria
   vesca (alpine strawberry) to Armillaria fungus, produced mixed
   results. Inoculation with pure AM Glomus intradices fungus gave the
   lowest death rates, but a mycorrhizal formulation for trees produced
   plants with the lowest weights. Fertiliser-treated plants were the
   heaviest.
