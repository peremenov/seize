<h>The Back to the "Fifties" Jukebox

<h>Now 200+ Fifties Classics in Streaming Real Audio

<p>We think these are the Best of the best!

<p>This is the page which has been publicised in a number of Magazines
   and Newsletters, and is largely responsible for winning us the above
   awards! We think it is fairly unique.

<p>You may spend Hours on this Page listening to some of the best Fifties
   Music on the Web, so bookmark it now, so you may return. If you enjoy
   it, please pass it along!

<h>Notice!

<p>I have made some major changes to all "Jukebox " pages. This is the
   result of a growing number of EMails saying various "Jukebox" pages
   not working.

<p>Jukebox pages can accomodate only one user at a time, and users remain
   on the page until selections have played. The rapidly growing number
   of hits on jukebox pages coupled with the time factor is causing
   problems.

<p>To alleviate this congestion, I have added an "Alternate" page for all
   jukeboxes.

<p>If songs are not loading or playing Click the Button Below to enter an
   "Alternate identical page.

<p>Also, remember the Jukebox pages do not work with the Realone Player.
   The solution for this problem is on the Fifties Menu page. If you are
   using the Realone Player please check it out also.

<p>Play your individual selections in Streaming Real Audio!

<p>Just like a real Jukebox. (Except it doesn't eat Quarters!)

<p>To make Selections, press and hold down the Control Key (Ctrl). Click
   each selection you wish to play, or to select all, press and hold down
   the shift key, click the top file, scroll down, and click the bottom
   file. When you finish making your Selections, release the Control Key
   or shift key, and Click on "Play These". MAC users, try the Command
   (Apple) key or the Shift key! We are receiving conflicting reports on
   MAC! 

<h>Important!

<p>To make multiple selections press and hold down the Control key while
   clicking on your selections.
