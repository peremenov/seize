<h>ProLiant benchmarks

   
 <p>  Through its proven track record of industry-standard benchmark
   results, HP has consistently demonstrated leadership in the
   performance and value of its servers.
  



<h>New

    
<p>    The HP ProLiant DL145 G2 overtook all 1U competitors with the fastest
   1U SPECweb2005 result. Equipped with 2 x 2.6GHz Dual-Core AMD
   Opteron(TM) 285 processors, the ProLiant DL145 G2 achieved the
   world-record SPECweb2005 score of 11,293 and defeated the Sun Fire
   T1000, Dell PowerEdge 1950, and the Fujitsu Siemens PRIMERGY RX220 S1.
   

   
 <p>   The second generation HP ProLiant DL585 is the first server to break
   the 20,000 SPECwebÂ©2005 barrier.  By holding the top 3 SPECwebÂ©2005
   results, the ProLiant DL585 G1 and G2 demonstrate HPs dominant
   position over all competing servers.
   

<p>    Industry benchmarks demonstrate HP ProLiant DL580 G4, ProLiant DL585
   G2 and ProLiant ML570 G4 outpace the competition in workload after
   workload.
   

   
 <p>   The HP ProLiant BL480c, introduced as a new category of server blade
   that delivers an unmatched combination of two processors, Multi-Core
   performance, and expansion, earned a 50% increase in scalability with
   a TPC-C Benchmark of 222,117/tpmC @ USD $2.72/tpmC. The HP ProLiant
   BL480c is the only server blade tested out of all competitors for the
   TPC-C Performance Benchmark.
   

   
<p>    Once again, the HP ProLiant ML370 G5 distinguishes itself as a leader
   for database intensive applications with the release of its latest
   TPC-C benchmark result. The ProLiant ML370 G5 server achieved top
   results for a 2-processor server on the TPC-C benchmark (64-bit) with
   240,737 tpmC @ $1.85/tpmC. The server was running Microsoft Windows
   Server 2003 EE x64 operating system and Microsoft SQL Server 2005
   Enterprise x64 Edition SP1 database. The ProLiant ML370 G5 was
   configured with 2 x 2.66GHz/1333MHz Quad-Core IntelÂ® X5355 processors
   (2 processors/8 cores/8 threads).
   
 
   
<p>    The HP ProLiants BL480c and DL380 G5 achieved the highest
   two-processor server performance results on the two-tier SAPÂ® Sales
   and Distribution (SD) Standard Application Benchmark with 1,806 and
   1,790 SAP SD Benchmark users, respectively. The servers defeated IBM,
   Dell, Fujitsu, Bull, and Hitachi two-processor rack server and server
   blade competitors by up to 126% and also showed 48% and 47%
   scalability, respectively, from previous benchmarks.
