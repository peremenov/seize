<p>Immigration attorneys offering representation to obtain H-1B work
   visas, labor certifications and J-1 waiver applications for foreign
   medical graduates and physicians. Physicians who receive clinical
   medical residency training in the U.S. pursuant to a J-1 exchange
   visitor visa are required to return to their home country for two
   years before they are eligible to apply for an H-1B visa or permanent
   residency. J-1 visa physicians need not complete this two-year home
   requirement if they are approved for a waiver to deliver medical
   services in a designated underserved area or at a VA hospital. In
   addition, the United States Congress, under the leadership of Senator
   Conrad, has mandated that all states (as well as the District of
   Columbia and certain territories, such as Puerto Rico and Guam) may
   act as interested state agencies (State 30 Program), recommending up
   to thirty (30) national interest waivers for J-1 physicians per state
   each fiscal year. These waiver recommendations are available in
   addition to any VA, ARC or DHHS waivers that may be issued for
   locations within that state. Most J-1 Visa Waivers typically require a
   three year service obligation. However, certain states, such as West
   Virginia, require a four-year contractfrom a immigration firm in
   Virginia. All waiver programs require a showing that the employer has
   made efforts to recruit a U.S. physician and a Canadian doctor prior
   to offering a position to a J-1 physician.

<p>Robert Lubin offers work visas, Appalachian regional commission, Conrad
waivers, naturalization of business immigration, and law firms in Washington
                                  DC area.

<p>Robert Lubin & Associates, P.C. (formerly known as The Law Offices of
   Robert Lubin, P.C.) was founded in 1988 and the firm focuses
   exclusively on work visas, Conrad waivers, and immigration law firm
   issues (with some business immigration law services provided to
   immigration clients only). Naturalization is the process by which
   permanent residents can obtain U.S. citizenship status. In some cases,
   dual citizenship may be retained. Since naturalized citizens share
   practically all of the same rights as citizens born in the United
   States, this is an important step to take to complete the immigration
   process. Obtaining a J-1 waiver is a three-step process. The first
   step is to obtain a recommendation for a waiver from an interested
   government agency (IGA), like HHS or Appalachian Regional Commission.
   This recommendation is then forwarded to the United States Department
   of State Waiver Review Division in Washington, D.C. (formerly known as
   the USIA), which in turn issues its recommendation to the U.S.
   Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which provides approval
   of an Application to Waive Foreign Residence Requirements (Form
   I-612).

<p>Immigration information for H-1b visas, foreign medical graduates, Conrad
   30, hardship waivers, nonimmigrant doctors, and adjustment of status.

<p>The H-1B is a nonimmigrant visa classification used by an applicant
   who will be employed temporarily in a specialty occupation.
   Requirements include a job offer in a qualifying occupation, a
   bachelor's degree or equivalent at a minimum, and an offered salary
   that meets prevailing wage requirements. The H-1B visa is a popular
   tool for temporary employment of foreign medical graduates. Hardship
   waiver if the U.S. citizen or permanent resident spouse and/or child
   accompanies the J-1 visa holder back to the home country for two
   years. Therefore, a hardship waiver application must establish that
   the U.S. citizen or permanent resident spouse and/or child will suffer
   exceptionally as a result of returning to the J-1 visa holder's home
   country and remaining in the U.S. without the J-1 visa holder for two
   years. The ARC program is limited to doctors who have completed
   residency training in a primary care field, which is generally defined
   as internal medicine, family practice, general practice, pediatrics,
   general psychiatry or obstetrics and gynecology, and the physician
   must agree to practice such primary care. We also offer information on
   Conrad 30 and adjustments of status.

<p>Immigration attorneys offering J-1 waivers, O-1 visas, and labor
  certifications for international medical graduates, and foreign doctors.

<p>Our immigration attorneys offer O-1 visas are temporary nonimmigrant
   visas, available for highly talented or acclaimed individuals in the
   sciences, education, business or athletics. To qualify for an O-1
   visa, the applicant must have extraordinary ability "demonstrated by
   sustained national or international acclaim." Extraordinary ability
   means a "level of expertise indicating that the person is one of that
   small percentage who has risen to the very top of the field of
   endeavor." The O-1 category is especially helpful to medical
   researchers such as foreign doctors, athletes, and business people who
   may lack the qualifications or salary required for the J-1 waiver
   program. In addition, to date, there have been no numerical
   limitations reached on the J-1 program, thereby allowing any number of
   international medical graduate applicants to qualify each fiscal year.
   In order to apply for Labor Certification (LC), an applicant must
   obtain an employer to sponsor him/her through a job offer. The LC
   process consists of three phases leading to permanent residency. The
   first phase involves obtaining a Labor Certification from the
   Department of Labor (DOL). The second phase involves obtaining an
   immigrant visa petition approval from the U.S. Citizenship and
   Immigration Services (USCIS) based on the DOL Labor Certification. The
   third phase involves the applicant's application to either adjust
   status from non-immigrant to permanent resident here in the U.S., or
   obtain an immigrant visa at an American Consulate in the home country.
