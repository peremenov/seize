<h>Three seconds is all it takes to turn a whole life around

<p>And if anybody knows about bouncing back after disaster, it's
   fortysomething Clare Wilson. She's had it with being married to a
   serial cheater, and no way is he getting another chance. Even her own
   son thinks she should have kicked his dad to the curb ages ago. Now
   she's done it for good, and Clare is finally feeling the rush of
   unadulterated freedom.

<p>But when a freak car crash lands Clare in the hospital, her life takes
   another detour. She might be banged up and bruised, but suddenly men
   are coming out of the woodwork. Even her ex is pining for her. It
   seems being an independent single woman is a powerful aphrodisiac. But
   amidst all the lust, the last thing Clare expects to find is love.

<p>Not much can go wrong when you're traveling first-class with your
   fabulously wealthy boyfriend--until you find his wife's body in your
   hotel suite.

<p>Convinced she's next on Nick Noble's hit list, Jennifer Chaise takes
   off down the Vegas Strip with only her wits and Kate Spade bag full of
   money. Giving herself a drastic makeover--complete with a new
   name--she lands herself a waitressing job in a nearby town. For
   someone used to private jets and waterfront condos, the change in
   lifestyle couldn't be greater. Yet, oddly enough, Jennifer couldn't be
   happier.

<p>And then she meets Alex Nichols. One of the Las Vegas police
   department's finest, he's everything she's ever wanted. But when
   Nick's bodyguards arrive in town, Jennifer knows that if she wants a
   future she's going to have to deal with the past.

<p>Nikki Burgess has survived a terrible marriage and an even worse
   divorce. And she's just about given up hope of every finding love and
   happiness. But when her ex-husband suddenly dies, she gets custody of
   her kids again and a chance to start over and do it right.

<p>Dixie McPherson, on the other hand, has had way too much love. She has
   eleven tennis bracelets, dozens of trinkets, piles of sexy lingerie
   and a tarnished reputation when all she ever wanted was true love, a
   partner and a family.

<p>Carlisle Bartlett is loyal, generous, kindhearted and the funniest guy
   slinging drinks in the back of an airplane. But he has an ugly little
   secret. The only kind of love he's used to comes with bruises.

<p>They are three people who could seriously use a break. A fresh start.
   A shot of success and a chance to shine. Maybe a little romance--the
   kind that sticks. And some adventure wouldn't hurt. So when they're
   presented with the challenge of joining a team starting a new airline
   in Las Vegas, they don't hesitate. With nothing to lose and everything
   to gain, these three friends are going in search of their own blue
   skies.

<p>Return with critically acclaimed author Robyn Carr to the fictional
   town of Grace Valley, California -- where neighbors are like
   family--and just as meddlesome, too. When the town's single doctor
   becomes pregnant, the pastor starts playing too much poker and the
   town's matriarch reveals a secret paramour, Grace Valley is
   overflowing with gossip. But when danger threatens the town and its
   people, this community shows exactly what it's made of.

<p>June Hudson is the town's doctor, a caring, capable woman who now has
   a bit of explaining to do. People are beginning to notice the bloom in
   her cheeks--and the swell of her belly. Happily, DEA agent Jim Post is
   back in June's arms for good, newly retired from undercover work and
   ready for new beginnings here in Grace Valley.

<p>Expecting the unexpected is a way of life in Grace Valley, and the
   community is overflowing with gossip right now. Who is the secret
   paramour June's aunt Myrna is hiding? Does the town's poker-playing
   pastor have too many aces up his sleeve?

<p>But when dangers, from man and nature, rise up with a vengeance to
   threaten June and the town, this community pulls together and shows
   what it's made of. And Jim discovers the true meaning of happiness
   here in Grace Valley: there really is no place like home.

<p>Welcome back to Grace Valley, California, where the best things in
   life never change...

<p>Here in this peaceful community, folks look out for one another like
   family, though sometimes a little too well.  In a town like this, it's
   hard to keep a secret--though Dr. June Hudson has managed to keep one
   heck of a humdinger...

<p>Though visits from her secret lover, undercover DEA agent Jim Post,
   are as clandestine as they are passionate, somehow it fits with her
   demanding schedule as the town's doctor--a calling that requires an
   innate ability to exist on caffeine, sticky buns and nerves of steel.

<p>But how can a secret lover compete with a flesh and blood heartthrob
   from her past?  June's old flame has just returned to town after
   twenty years--and he's divorced. June is seriously rattled.  So when
   the town's most devoted wife takes buckshot to her husband and some
   human bones turn up in her aunt Myrna's backyard, she's almost happy
   for the distraction.

<p>Sooner or later, love with have its way in Grace Valley.  It always
   does.
