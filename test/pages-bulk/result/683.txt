<h>Accepting the Paul White Award
 
<p>Thank you. I am humbled to be here tonight. If you hear nothing else
   that follows, hear this -BELIEVE it - I do not deserve this honor.

<p>If you hear only one OTHER thing, hear THIS: Without the inspiration
   and support of my wife Jean, I wouldn't deserve so much as a plate of
   cold mashed potatoes.

<p>I DON'T deserve this. Few practitioners in the whole history of our
   craft have ever truly deserved to have their names mentioned with that
   of the late, great Paul White. I am not among them. And about that, I
   have no illusions.

<p>"Great" is a vastly overworked word in the vocabulary of those of us
   who work in front of microphones and cameras. We use it too often, too
   loosely. Most especially when we apply it to ourselves, in our own
   minds.

<p>Ego inflation is a disease of our trade, one that has grown rampant in
   our professional lifetimes. But "great" is an apt word in remembering
   Paul White.

<p>Paul White was, in fact and on the record, the first true news
   DIRECTOR. As such, he led some of the greatest names in electronic
   journalism. Edward R. Murrow, William L. Shirer, Eric Sevareid and
   Charles Collingwood, now all rightly in the pantheon of electronic
   journalism, were all guided - and formed early in their careers - by
   Paul White.

<p>Before Paul White, there was no such person, no such thing as a news
   director in broadcasting. Not in the sense that the title "news
   director" is now understood.

<p>Paul White was, literally, the father of radio news. And he helped to
   father its offspring, television news. He came out of newspapering to
   join CBS in 1930, as news editor and director of news. In 1933, he
   organized the Columbia News Service when the wire services, under
   pressure from newspaper chains, shut out radio stations and networks.

<p>Over time Paul White, in partnership with Ed Murrow, began molding CBS
   News into the gold standard for broadcast news. Murrow in front of the
   microphone and in the field, Paul White behind the scenes and in the
   front office.

<p>Never has there been so powerful, so effective a combination of news
   director and on-air talent. The keys were mutual respect, and mutual
   dedication to excellence and integrity in the news.

<p>Together, White and Murrow, with Bob Trout and the network's best
   correspondents, invented "The CBS World News Roundup," first broadcast
   in 1937 and still on the air over CBS Radio. The idea - innovative,
   even revolutionary in its day - was to bring in reporters LIVE from
   far corners of the globe, as the storm that became World War II began
   breaking loose.

<p>The format caught on, took hold and spread. Radio AND television's
   daily newscasts around the world, to this day, are modeled on that
   breakthrough idea.

<p>Paul White knew that World War II was brewing - not because he was a
   fortune-teller, but because even though he was a quote "manager,"
   unquote, he was ALSO a go-there, be-there newsman. He traveled to
   Europe in 1938, and what he saw confirmed for him that war was
   inevitable. Thus, when Murrow and Shirer came to him, asking for more
   resources and air-time to cover the gathering storm, Paul White didn't
   argue with them or try to second-guess them. He didn't need to cite
   budget projections - instead, he could honestly support their news
   judgments, and his own.

<p>As far as I know, it never occurred to him to do otherwise. That's the
   kind of news director you want to work for, the kind you want to be.

<p>The best managers I've known in the news business still do it the same
   way. Not content to lock themselves behind windowless doors, they go
   out and scout the news themselves whenever they can. And when they
   CAN'T get out - they respect the news judgments of their reporters in
   the field. Working professionals themselves, they respect other
   working pros.

<p>Paul White was a teacher as well as a working pro. He taught Murrow
   and the Murrow Boys, and he taught at Columbia University from 1939 to
   1946. And it's worth noting that Paul White didn't merely PRACTICE
   high standards - he put them in a book, where he hoped that the young
   - students and professionals - would find them and learn from them.

<p>And so he wrote News on the Air. For a long time it was THE definitive
   textbook on broadcast journalism. It influenced three generations of
   radio and television reporters, including the present generation - and
   specifically including this reporter, who devoured the book in
   college.

<p>White was dedicated to making the future of radio and television as
   ethical and integrity-filled as possible. He had a constant eye for
   standards that could and would be upheld. He was determined to pass on
   the lessons learned from one professional generation to the next.

<p>He was believed by his colleagues and his biographers (and perhaps
   even his doctors) to have worked himself to death. Perfectionism and
   overwork are cited as causes of his death whenever he is remembered by
   his contemporaries. Let us pause now, my friends, to ponder that. His
   was the commitment to craft that many of us joke about making - but
   never make.

<p>HE loved the news so much that it killed him. Literally. He was dead
   at age 53. For those of you who haven't reached the age of 53, let me
   assure you: 53 is young. Too young to die. Too young for anyone as
   dedicated as Paul White even to consider retiring. When he left CBS
   News, he took up the "less demanding" job of news director at station
   K-F-M-B in San Diego. And died there.

<p>Nobody, NOBODY ever cared more about our craft than Paul White. Nobody
   ever tried harder to make it not just good but EXCELLENT. I suspect
   that even excellence wasn't enough for Paul White. PERFECTION really
   was what he sought. No, perfection isn't possible - but that doesn't
   seem to have stopped him from striving.

<p>Nobody ever tried harder to make news reporting accurate and fair,
   decent and responsible - a life's work to be proud of, a SERVICE
   worthy of every reporter's lifetime commitment.

<p>Which brings me to US. You and I, custodians of the legacy of the first
   and best news director in the history of radio and television.

<p>In Miami a few years ago I stood before this organization and invoked
   the name of Edward R. Murrow, the lead pitcher on the winning team
   Paul White coached and captained. Four years ago, I recalled Murrow's
   disappointment as he witnessed the decline in our standards-already
   declining in 1958, only three years after Paul White's death.
   Thirty-five years after Murrow sounded the battle cry, I tried as well
   as I could to get us all to consider the question: How goes the battle
   for integrity in our own time?

<p>The answer, as I saw it, was: Not very well.

<p>The question still needs to be asked-and answered, honestly-four years
   later, here, in Paul White's name as it was asked in Ed Murrow's.

<p>I believe the question needs to be asked by each of us, every day.

<p>But we must also ask-How can we do better? It is not enough, in
   looking at ourselves, to catalog our faults. Finding fault is
   easy-especially in any endeavor so flawed as our own.

<p>Correcting the faults-that's more difficult. THAT is the challenge.

<p>In many cases, I have no certain idea how to correct the greatest
   problems in our craft. And I truly have no authority to recommend my
   ideas over yours. Paul White might have had such authority, I don't.

<p>Yet this much seems clear to me. What is needed most is the WILL to
   correct our faults.

<p>We will FIND the will only by caring, by seeking the best in ourselves
   and in others-and by saying so.

<p>Too often we come to these professional conferences and beat our
   breasts and tear our hair, we put on sack-cloth and ashes, and we
   spend hours discussing how terrible we are.

<p>Then we go out and party. Exactly as if nobody had said a word. I
   don't blame us: After some of those speeches, we probably NEED a good
   stiff drink. But the faults endure, uncorrected.

<p>When I spoke to you four years ago, a few people heard what I said and
   mislabeled it as preaching or nagging. They heard me criticize our
   craft. They didn't hear me speak of our idealism.

<p>Yet I found that it was the idealism that MOST people heard FIRST.

<p>I'll never forget the young woman from CBS News who came up to me
   after the speech with tears in her eyes, because she'd gone a long
   time believing that the network didn't WANT for her to do her best,
   believing that there was no room or BUDGET any more for excellence.
   The certainty that her best efforts wouldn't be appreciated had taken
   a toll.

<p>I was struck then, and since, by how seldom we do speak of those
   ideals.

<p>Have they become outdated, or shameful? Was there something wrong with
   those ideals? Did those ideals lack substance or force, to help us do
   our work, to help us correct our mistakes? Have we become such
   hard-bitten pros that we can't afford the time or energy to speak from
   our hearts?

<p>This I believe: Our failure to speak of our ideals has cost us some of
   our reputation, especially in the eyes of the American people, but
   also in the eyes of our new, worldwide audience.

<p>The audience is skeptical of us, and that's okay, that's right, they
   should be. We're only human, and they should take what we say with a
   grain of salt.

<p>But we need to ask ourselves why-WHY are so many Americans listening
   to those highly politicized, partisan, ideological voices who call us
   corrupt, self-serving, politically biased, and fundamentally
   dishonest? On the left and the right, there are dozens of well-funded
   organizations whose sole purpose it is to punish the journalistic
   community for our independence, for our refusal to parrot anybody's
   party line.

<p>We know those organizations are wrong

<p>So why are some Americans listening to them?

<p>Those organizations tell America that we are politically biased, that
   we are conspiring with one party or another.

<p>I know of few correspondents or producers, at my network or any other,
   who have ever in my presence stated their personal political
   views--even over a sarsaparilla in the shank of the evening. It's
   simply not done--bitterly frowned on by our colleagues--considered a
   sign of immaturity, unprofessionalism, foolishness.

<p>It is NOT a provable fact that there is a political bias in the press.
   Quite the contrary. But some demagogues and some organizations, ever
   leery of provable facts, nevertheless continue to spread the
   rumors--the deceitful advertising and rigged opinion surveys--and
   sometimes outright lies.

<p>As ever, free and honest, independent American journalism drives some
   people NUTS.

<p>When the Free Press is threatened--as it most assuredly is by such
   organizations -- all America is threatened. It's not a giant step from
   suppressing the press--to suppressing the speech--to suppressing the
   town meeting--to suppressing any political statement at all--to
   tyranny.

<p>We know that. Belief in the necessity of a Free Press is one of the
   ideals that brought us to journalism--to oppose such attempts at
   thought-control and intimidation. Are we talking about it enough?

<p>Do Americans KNOW that we really believe all that civics class stuff
   about a free press and public service, defending an independent
   citizenry with information--do they KNOW we believe that with our very
   SOULS? Do they know we wouldn't be working these jobs if we didn't,
   couldn't continue to believe those things? Do they know that the
   pressure is so great that, many days, our ideals are the only things
   that see us through?

<p>Let's talk about our ideals, not just tonight and amongst ourselves,
   but all the time.

<p>We need, now more than ever, to speak--to speak up and speak out, to
   explain to people what we are at least TRYING to do. And how we see
   ourselves and our work. The American people can then decide for
   themselves whether THEY believe we are meeting our own standards,
   living up to our own ideals as we have communicated them.

<p>We should not be afraid to speak about our idealism. Indeed, we should
   be eager to speak about it. But first we must remind ourselves what
   our ideals ARE.

<p>Our first and most important duty, our primary goal - TRUTH. As Oscar
   Wilde said, "The truth is rarely pure and never simple." Neither is it
   easy to find. But our GOAL as journalists is to report the truth. If
   not the whole truth, then certainly nothing but the truth, and as much
   of it as we can find.

<p>We too often fail at this. But it is important that people know this
   IS our goal.

<p>Overwhelmingly, most of us get into this craft, and stay in it,
   because we want to be of service.

<p>However it may sometimes APPEAR, we DIDN"T get into journalism for the
   money. We didn't get into it for the stardom, or for the adventure.

<p>We came to journalism because we wanted to make a difference, for good
   - to be of service, to our relatives and friends, to our communities
   and our country, and to humankind.

<p>And so we serve the belief that pursuit of truth is the most important
   service we can provide. THAT'S what we're about, when we are true to
   ourselves and are at our best.

<p>We ARE fallible. We DO make mistakes. And when we fail, when we make
   mistakes, we need to say so. In our idealism, we DO believe in
   standing up, looking 'em in the eye, and saying, "We were wrong." None
   of us say that as often as we have the opportunity. But we do believe
   in it. And we do believe in the pursuit of truth as the core of our
   craft.

<p>We believe, the best among us STILL believe, that a public journal is
   a public trust. And those of us in radio and television believe, in
   that spirit, that a newscast is a public journal.

<p>To be true to that trust, not to prostitute it, we believe in an
   absolute commitment to accuracy and fairness.

<p>Where does that commitment to the public trust stand in our relation
   to our desire (and perhaps more importantly to the command of our
   employers) that we increase circulation and ratings, and make ever
   more money?

<p>Our commitment must stand above commerce.

<p>That is our ideal. We do not, cannot say that we always practice our
   idealism in this regard. We can and do say, we must say, that we
   BELIEVE in the ideal. And we should say--here, now and
   henceforth--that we are rededicating ourselves to the practice of that
   ideal.

<p>About accuracy: There is no excuse for inaccuracy. When we are
   inaccurate, it must pain us deeply. We must be ashamed. A sense of
   shame when an error of fact is made is one mark, perhaps the single
   most important mark, of an ethical journalist.

<p>Another such mark is total dedication to fairness. It is not humanly
   possible to be fair in everyone's eyes on every story. But that IS our
   goal. We are dedicated to giving opposing viewpoints a fair
   representation. We are dedicated to showing respect for the rights,
   dignity and privacy of people as we gather and report the news.

<p>We do not believe in letting supermarket tabloids corrode and erode
   our duty to provide accurate and fair coverage of people and events.
   Those tabloids are not our competition. They do not set our standards.
   They are in a different business, and we can never forget that.

<p>In our worst moments, of which there have been far too many, we have
   all succumbed to sensationalism and triviality, to one degree or
   another. About that, we should all be ashamed. Because we do not
   believe in it. WHEN we have done it, we know in our heads and in our
   hearts, that we should not have. Because it is wrong.

<p>Credibility IS our creed. We know that we squander our credibility
   whenever we backslide into tabloid tactics. On those occasions, we do
   feel ashamed. And our readers, listeners and viewers need to know
   that.

<p>Just as we all know there are entertainment programs posing as
   newscasts, we know there are highly partisan political and ideological
   operations posing as news organizations.

<p>The public--some of the people, some of the time--may be fooled. We
   are not. We know what news is. And we know what a true news
   organization is.

<p>Yes, all of us, in some ways some of the time, let our biases show
   through. But--and this is the difference--we fight NOT to let that
   happen. Partisan political agendas are not what we are about. When it
   comes to news, in such things we do not believe.

<p>Four years ago I addressed this organization, and I spoke about fear.

<p>Tonight I wanted to talk about hope.

<p>After all, it's not fear that brings us to journalism. It's not fear
   that keeps us on the job.

<p>It's hope.

<p>Hope that we can do the job the right way.

<p>Hope that we can live up to the ideals that brought us here.

<p>Hope that the bosses will let us do our jobs.

<p>Hope that the audience will notice our best work.

<p>Hope that we'll deserve the hopes and faith our parents invested in
   us.

<p>Hope that we'll deserve the sacrifices made by our spouses and
   children, in the name of our careers.

<p>We don't talk about these things, I know. We work in an environment
   that encourages skepticism even cynicism. If we speak of the things
   that are in our hearts, we're certain--and we're usually right--that
   somebody is behind us, smirking.

<p>Well, too damn bad.

<p>We must speak--we must speak now, and more often--of our hopes. We
   must identify our ideals. We must communicate our beliefs--even as we
   live them.

<p>The risks of our silence are too great--we see already what can happen
   when we DON"T speak of ideals, of hopes, of belief.

<p>We MUST speak.

<p>I don't say this from some inflated idea of what journalism is.
   Journalism is not a religion--I know that. And if it were, it would
   need better preachers than I. But I hope that anybody, not just
   journalists but anyone who holds down a tough job, also holds onto
   hope.

<p>I hope my plumber has high standards, ethics, integrity.

<p>I hope she believes in doing the best job she can.

<p>I hope she wakes up every morning determined to be as good a plumber
   as Edward R. Murrow was a reporter.

<p>I hope she has apprentices, and teaches THEM what it means to do the
   job the right way.

<p>Because it's not enough to do the job right, not enough to embody the
   ideals. We must speak.

<p>We must repeat the lessons. The words count. That's why we speak our
   prayers, why we sing our hymns, why we go to temple and worship
   together, go to school and learn together.

<p>But you're never too old to learn. Never too young to teach.

<p>We must speak.

<p>We must speak as Paul White spoke, spending his dying breath to teach
   the journalists of the future.

<p>We are those journalists. Paul White isn't here to teach any more.
   It's up to us.

<p>We must speak. Thank you.
