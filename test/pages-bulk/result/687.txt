    <p>"Yudhishthira said, 'Tell me, O grandsire, how kings desirous of
   victory should, O bull of Bharata's race, lead their troops to battle
   even by offending slightly against the rules of righteousness!'

    <p>"Bhishma said: 'Some say that righteousness is made stable by truth;
   some, by reasoning: so me, by good behaviour; and some, by the
   application of means and contrivances. I shall presently tell thee
   what the means and contrivances, productive of immediate fruit, are.
   Robbers, transgressing all wholesome bounds, very often become
   destroyers of property and religious merit. For resisting and
   restraining them. I shall tell thee what the contrivances are, as
   indicated in the scriptures. Listen to me as I speak of those means
   for the success of all acts. Both kinds of wisdom, straight and
   crooked, should be within call of the king. Though acquainted with it,
   he should not, however, apply that wisdom which is crooked (for
   injuring others). He may use it for

    <p>p. 216

    <p>resisting the dangers that may overtake him. Enemies frequently injure
   a king by producing disunion (among his ministers or troops or allies
   or subjects). The king, conversant with deceit, may, by the aid of
   deceit, counteract those enemies. Leathern armour for protecting the
   bodies of elephants, armour of the same material for bovine bulls,
   bones, thorns, and keen-pointed weapons made of iron, coats of mail,
   yak-tails, sharp and well-tempered weapons, all kinds of armour,
   yellow and red, banners and standards of diverse hues, swords, and
   lances and scimitars of great sharpness and battle-axes, and spears
   and shields, should be manufactured and stored in abundance. The
   weapons should all be properly whetted. The soldiers should be
   inspired with courage and resolution. It is proper to set the troops
   in motion in the month of Chaitra or Agrahayana. The crops ripen about
   that time and water also does not become scarce. That time of the
   year, O Bharata, is neither very cold nor very hot. Troops should,
   therefore, be moved at that time. If the enemy, however, be overtaken
   by distress, troops should immediately be set in motion (without
   waiting for such a favourable time). These (two) are the best
   occasions for the motion of troops with a view to subjugate foes. That
   road which has abundance of water and grass along it, which is level
   and easy of march, should be adopted (in moving the troops). The
   regions lying near the road (on both its sides) should previously be
   well ascertained through spies possessed of skill and having an
   intimate knowledge of the woods. The troops must not, like animals, be
   marched through woody regions. Kings desirous of victory should,
   therefore, adopt good roads for marching their troops. In the van
   should be placed a division of brave men, endued with strength and
   high birth. As regards forts, that which has walls and a trench full
   of water on every side and only one entrance, is worthy of praise. In
   respect of invading foes, resistance may be offered from within it. In
   pitching the camp, a region lying near the woods is regarded as much
   better than one under the open sky by men conversant with war and
   possessed of military accomplishments. The camp should be pitched for
   the troops not far from such a wood. Pitching the camp at such a
   place, planting the foot-soldiers in a position of safety, and
   collision with the foe as soon as he comes, are the means for warding
   off danger and distress. Keeping the constellation called Ursa Major
   behind them, the troops should fight taking up their stand like hills.
   By this means, one may vanquish even foes that are irresistible. The
   troops should be placed in such a position that the wind, the sun, and
   the planet Sukra should blow and shine from behind them. As means
   for ensuing victory the wind is superior to the Sun, and the Sun is
   superior to Sukra, O Yudhishthira. Men conversant with war approve of
   a region that is not miry, not watery, not uneven, and not abounding
   with bricks and stone, as well-fitted for the operations of cavalry. A
   field that is free from mire and holes is fitted for car-warriors. A
   region that is overgrown with bushes and large trees and that is under
   water is fitted for elephant-warriors.

    <p>p. 217

    <p>[paragraph continues] A region that has many inaccessible spots, that
   is overgrown with large trees and topes of cane bushes, as also a
   mountainous or woody tract, is well-fitted for the operations of
   infantry. An army, O Bharata, which has a large infantry force, is
   regarded very strong. An army in which cars and horsemen predominate
   is regarded to be very effective in a clear (unrainy) day. An army,
   again; in which footsoldiers and elephants predominate becomes
   effective in the rainy season. Having attended to these points (about
   the characters of the different kinds of forces and the manner of
   marching, quartering, and leading them), the king should turn his
   attention to the characteristics of place and time. That king, who
   having attended to all these considerations, sets out under a proper
   constellation and on an auspicious lunation, always succeeds in
   obtaining victory by properly leading his troops. No one should slay
   those that are asleep or thirsty or fatigued, or those whose
   accoutrements have fallen away, or one that has set his heart on final
   emancipation, or one that is flying away, or one that is walking
   (unprepared) along a road, or one engaged in drinking or eating, or
   one that is mad, or one that is insane, or one that has been wounded
   mortally, or one that has been exceedingly weakened by his wounds, or
   one that is staying trustfully, or one that has begun any task without
   having been able to complete it, or one that is skilled in some
   especial art (as mining, etc.), or one that is in grief, or one that
   goes out of the camp for procuring forage or fodder, or men who set up
   camps or are camp-followers, or those that wait at the gates of the
   king or of his ministers, or those that do menial services (unto the
   chiefs of the army), or those that are chiefs of such servants. Those
   amongst thy warriors that break the rank of foes, or rally thy
   retreating troops, should have their pay doubled and should be
   honoured by thee with food, drink, and seats equal to thy own. Those
   amongst such that are chiefs of ten soldiers should be made chiefs of
   a hundred. That heedful hero again (amongst them) who is the chief of
   a hundred soldiers should be made the chief of a thousand. Collecting
   together the principal warriors, they should be addressed, thus: 'Let
   us swear to conquer, and never to desert one another. Let those that
   are inspired with fear stay here. Let those also stay here that would
   cause their chiefs to be slain by themselves neglecting to act
   heroically in the press of battle. Let such men come as would never
   break away from battle or cause their own comrades to be slain.
   Protecting their own selves as also their comrades, they are certain
   to slay the enemy in fight. The consequence of flying away from battle
   are loss of wealth, death, infamy, and reproach. Disagreeable and
   cutting speeches have to be heard by that man who flies away from
   battle, who loses his lips and teeth, who throws away all his
   weapons, or who suffers himself to be taken as a captive by the foe.
   Let such evil consequences always overtake the warriors of our foes.
   Those that fly away from battle are wretches among men. They simply
   swell the tale of

    <p>p. 218

    <p>human beings on earth. For true manhood, however, they are neither
   here nor hereafter. Victorious foes, O sire, proceed cheerfully. Their
   praises recited the while by bards, in pursuit of the flying
   combatants. When enemies, coming to battle tarnish the fame of a
   person, the misery the latter feels is more poignant, I think, than
   that of death itself. Know that victory is the root of religious merit
   and of every kind of happiness. That which is regarded as the highest
   misery by cowards is cheerfully borne by those that are heroes.
   Resolved upon acquiring heaven, we should fight, regardless of life
   itself, and determined to conquer or die, attain a blessed end in
   heaven. Having taken such an oath, and prepared to throwaway life
   itself, heroes should courageously rush against the enemy's ranks. In
   the van should be placed a division of men armed with swords and
   shields. In the rear should be placed the car-division. In the space
   intervening should be placed other classes of combatants. This should
   be the arrangement made for assailing the foe. Those combatants in the
   army that are veterans should fight in the van. They would protect
   their comrades behind them. Those amongst the army that would be
   regarded as foremost for strength and courage, should be placed in the
   van. The others should stand behind them. They that are inspired with
   fear should, with care, be comforted and encouraged. These weaker
   combatants should be placed on the field (without being withdrawn) for
   at least showing the number of the army (to the foe). If the troops
   are few, they should be drawn close together for the fight. At times,
   if their leader wishes, the close array may be extended wide. When a
   small number of troops is to fight with a great army, the array called
   Suchimukha should be formed. When a small force is engaged with a
   large one, the leader of the former may shake hands with his men and
   utter loud cries to effect, 'The enemy has broken! The enemy has
   broken!' Those among them that are endued with strength should resist
   the enemy, loudly unto their comrades, 'Fresh friends have arrived!
   Fearlessly strike at your foes!' Those that are in advance of the rest
   should utter loud shouts and make diverse kinds of noises, and should
   blow and beat Krakachas, cow-horns, drums, cymbals, and
   kettle-drums.'"

    <p>215:1 I do not understand how this is an answer to Yudhishthira's
   question. Nilakantha thinks that truth, in the above, means the
   ordinances in respect of Kshatriya duties; that Upapatti, which I
   understand means reasoning (or conclusion), indicates a disregard for
   life, for those ordinances lead to no other conclusion. Good
   behaviour, according to him, means encouraging the soldiers, speaking
   sweetly to them, and promoting the brave, etc. Means and contrivances
   consist in punishing desertion and cowardliness, etc. If Nilakantha be
   right, what Bhishma says is that battles (which, of course, are
   intended for the protection of righteousness) become possible in
   consequence of these four causes.
