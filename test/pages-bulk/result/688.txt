   <h>Wall Street Kisses Goldilocks Goodbye
   <h>by Ed Bugos
  
   <p> "Those who scorn inflation today will hail it tomorrow
   as the last bastion of profitability"...Ed Bugos

   <h>Rising Wedgies
    <p>Some market technicians, including myself, view the rising wedge as a
   completion pattern. It is not an easy pattern to discern, especially
   if the market has fooled you with so many more easily visible bearish
   sucker plays. A rising wedge, as distinct from the corrective bounce
   that is often interpreted as a flag when it takes on the same shape
   and shorter duration, is often a final extension to a long running
   bull leg. Even if one is seen, it is difficult to believe because of
   the bullishly misleading sequence of higher highs and higher lows
   coming at a high point in confidence for the market.

    <p>Yet, even though not a certainty until prices begin to fall from and
   therefore confirm the pattern, its implications are thought to be
   large enough that many speculators try to anticipate the break. In
   theory, these patterns are defined by a narrowing in the rising price
   channel on diminishing volume, and can last anywhere from two to six
   months, sometimes even a little longer. A diminishing, or petering
   out, in fresh investment interest explains both their price behavior
   and volume behavior. And when they do fall out of this humdrum
   pattern, the degree of the move is almost always substantial.

    <p>Virtually all of the stock charts below, and which I use for my report
   come from www.stockcharts.com, my favorite free (for now) charting
   website.

   <h>Inside the Dow 30; a few important "possibilities"


    <p>I have deliberately omitted marking up the charts so that you may make
   your own interpretation, but I am sure that you will find, in all
   cases, that long existing trends are already in place, that volumes
   have visibly diminished over the past six months (of course it is
   summer, but a wedge is a wedge), that the intermediate trend channels
   have noticeably narrowed, and that outside of GE, momentum has been
   generally diverging, even so far into September. Ask yourself, where
   is this index without these component stocks? Naturally, if this
   assessment proves correct...

   <h>...That Will Not Be Good

                       
    <p>In both of the blue chip indexes above, momentum appears so negligible
   as to cast aside the significance of the breakout in the broader NYSE
   composite (to the right), which itself almost appears to be developing
   a six month rising wedge. However, that being said, there is indeed a
   few things happening in the stock market that deserve special
   attention.

    <h>A potential theoretically perfect negative correlation
    <p>Wall Street bulls will sell the powerful rally in the Dow Utilities
   Average as a double whammy. If their slow growth scenario pans out,
   these puppies should benefit from the lower interest rate environment,
   they will claim. If the energy crisis escalates on the other hand,
   there is a powerfully bullish story in that direction for the
   Utilities! Before I go on, which of the two preceding outcomes do you
   think that the below charts have already been discounting?

   
    <p>If you guessed the latter, you are dead on. At least four American
   Utility icons are positioned to take advantage of a growing global
   need for alternate power infrastructures less reliant on oil and gas.
   These companies are clearly the global leaders of choice in such an
   undertaking, many of them having been around as long as the Fed and
   perhaps more necessary, if the energy problem literally turns into a
   crisis. Therefore, I would suggest that the developing negative
   correlation with the Dow Transports supports this latter, more
   interesting growth story.

    <p>While both averages may benefit from lower interest rates, only one
   can truly benefit from an energy crisis. The following companies have
   spent significant resources, and perhaps even time, positioning
   themselves to benefit from this, globally. They have the knowledge and
   capital to offer many oil dependent economies an alternative, higher
   tech solution to their energy problems. So put down your Benjamin
   Graham textbook and check out these charts:

                            

    <p>Glancing at these stock charts, one might conclude that there are some
   big things happening here. Undeniably, he or she would be correct.
   There are, but again, they have nothing to do with lower interest
   rates or defensive investing, and they have everything to do with
   increasingly bullish expectations for global demand to step up for
   alternative power infrastructures. Comically, if Wall Street really
   gets behind this "remarkable" story, they will have to denounce their
   Goldilocks allegiance! There is no double whammy here. Let me put it
   to you this way; without a potential oil crisis, there is no real
   potential for this Utilities play.

    <p>Additionally, if OPEC's 800,000 daily barrel addition doesn't quell
   oil prices immediately this week and inflation numbers come in on the
   high side of expectations, momentum may carry these stocks further, at
   least for a week or so. However, I personally am inclined to wait out
   the highly probable second bear leg in the rest of the market to
   unfold first. That's right, second.

   <h>On the other hand, go Goldilocks go
    <p>Rumors surfaced in Germany midweek that Europe's biggest banking
   group, Deutsche Bank AG, is in talks to acquire the mighty JP Morgan.
   Can anybody appreciate the politics behind this supposed deal as much
   as I can? I never saw it coming. Anyway, by the end of the week,
   Morgan's CFO, Peter Hancock handed in his resignation to pursue
   longstanding entrepreneurial interests. In the end, this may turn out
   to be nothing but a difference in opinion, at worst. But if it were
   nothing, why would he not put off his resignation until after this
   whole thing was over, being sort of a key person in a major
   acquisition and all? Anyway you slice it; it still is a red flag.

    <p>Is the US investment business for sale? This is the thought that had
   crossed my mind when I first heard this merger talk on Wednesday,
   before Mr. Hancock's resignation. It is the thought that crossed my
   mind when DLJ sold out to Credit Suisse Group recently. The seed for
   that thought, however, actually occurred immediately after the UBS
   acquisition of Paine Webber. The reason is that I had just finished
   The Politics of the Dollar, where I had put forth that the US is now
   vulnerable to political extortion on account of potentially discontent
   foreign dollar owners. In other words, the balance of political power
   will shift to foreign dollar owners as long as US politicians will
   want to keep them from selling off the currency (to prevent
   inflation). Let me explain.

    <p>These events have been driving M&A speculation in the US financial
   sector to new heights, dragging along with it the Dollar/Euro exchange
   rate. The big monetary problem facing the financial system is the
   circulation of excess dollars. Therefore, I suggest that it is in the
   US interest, in order to forestall a dollar crisis at this point, to
   convert foreign short-term deposits into long-term foreign direct
   investment. And I believe that it is in Europe's dollar owner's
   interests to find something useful to do with all of their excess
   dollars. So while the Europeans are busy buying US banks from day
   traders at record highs, American financial interests may be buying
   failed Asian banks, cheaply. This is nothing but an observation at
   this point but it is interesting, because in my second to last report,
   Inflation versus Deflation, I suggest that Japan is a net global
   creditor and therefore most likely to survive the currency debacle
   that is right around the corner.

    <p>Even worse, however, is that these headlines take away from all the
   other garbage that the Europeans are buying. I have observed, in
   previous research, the relationship between the falling Euro and the
   rising issuance of US Asset Backed Commercial Paper, specifically
   finance company debt or consumer installment credit. My conclusion was
   that the US financial sector has been monetizing low quality debt in
   this last cycle. This argument can also be found in the report
   Inflation versus Deflation. Interestingly, in an August 31 issue of
   "Capital Issues," entitled "Watch Reserves, not Rates", the author
   points to a striking 0.88 correlation between US commercial bank paper
   and the European Central Bank assets. This is the first time I had
   read their quality work.

   <h>"Operation Discredit GATA," is well under way!
    <p>Normally, I stay away from arguing any claims that I cannot properly
   bear out, which is why you will find little on the topic of
   manipulation, other than the occasional restrained inference, in any
   of my other research. There are two reasons for this. First,
   conspiracy theories are far too easy to discredit, and should the
   allegations actually be true, the theorists will surely be targeted.
   Second, I have long ago accepted that many markets, especially gold,
   just simply get manipulated anyhow. Why wouldn't they? In fact, Mr.
   Greenspan himself said this recently while speaking about the rapid
   pace of change and innovation in the international financial system:

    <p>The rapidly changing international financial climate is certain to
   create nostalgia for the gold standard among those of us engaged to
   replace it - Paraphrase.

    <p>Some skilled traders, as well as myself, purport to see it in the tape
   on far more occasions than the average person might want to believe.
   The whacked out gold/silver ratios, gold/oil ratios, and gold/asset
   ratios are enough to at least legitimize any inquiry into such
   manipulation. Global bankers who declare that it represents an
   unprofitable investment in the new economy easily meet every rise in
   the demand for gold with their own supply, unwittingly improving its
   fundamentals with each ounce that is sold from their vaults to the
   public. And even while global monetary fundamentals arguably improve
   to gold's advantage relative to the international reserve currency's
   outlook, revealing an enormously conspicuous anomaly on the chart, the
   World Gold Council claims that it is certain that there exists no such
   manipulation.

    <p>It is common knowledge that the Fed manipulates interest rates, and
   until recently, money supply as well. It is also well understood that
   the government manipulates (under the guise of regulation or some
   misguided policy directive) many other economic dynamics in our
   interest, presumably. Do we need a special briefing by the CIA to
   believe what we already know is likely true? The question therefore is
   why are they trying so hard to deny it? Perhaps because it is so
   difficult to come up with a plausible argument as to why it is in our
   best interest, but possibly also because they have learnt how
   effective outright denial of any wrongdoing can be, especially in
   dealing with a public that has a vested interest in their paper.

    <p>Whatever the case may be it can be treacherous as a professional
   trader not to assume that someone is playing market games. There is
   always a shepherd.

   <h>The Harder They Try, The More Obvious They Become
    <p>So suddenly, I find myself talking about a subject that I had always
   personally viewed as an overly mashed potato. The reason is that as a
   broker, when a promoter would approach me with a deal and become
   aggravated by my questions, he would pull out a thick technical
   report, sometimes as long as 100 pages or more, in the hope that I
   would be satisfied with the project simply because someone else
   already undertook the due diligence, presumably on my behalf. Though,
   to his negative surprise, upon reading through the mumbo jumbo, I
   would find not only that I had even more annoying questions, but also
   that I suddenly knew more about the entire venture than he did.

    <p>Similarly, Dr. Jessica Cross' recent 200-page report called "Gold
   Derivatives Growth Unsustainable" released on 4 September 2000, has
   literally dragged me out of the closet on this mashed potato.

   <h>The Definition of Spin
    <p>Lots of spin is going on out there these days, though it used to be
   called nonsense in the old economy. My 1984 Pocket Oxford uses terms
   like spinning, twisting, and manipulating a yarn to define the term in
   its linguistically intended form. But by far, Mr. Don Mathews at
   mises.org wrote the most interesting definition I have ever come by,
   which I view as relevant to the business of money also. In an article
   titled "Gore on Oil," he said that:

    <p>His (Gore's) charge of conspiracy and price gouging is spin. Spin is
   the political class euphemism for calculated mendacity, for planned
   distortion, for twisting and contorting fact and reason until truth
   becomes all but impossible to decipher. In the normal world, spin is
   thought of with disgust. But in the political world, spin is a tool,
   and the handiest tool at that; and those who use spin with skill rise
   high in politics.

    <p>In the financial business as well, he should have added. For as the
   price of gold declines and bankers continue to satisfy excess demand
   with their own gold "reserves," the spin they have found most
   opportunistic is that gold's monetary significance has diminished. And
   they have done much to twist and contort fact and reason until truth
   has become all but impossible to decipher. In fact, the same brute
   force tactics appear to have evolved in the financial stocks of late
   mention, and the spin they weave (if that makes sense) is European
   endorsement of the legitimacy of US financial interests.

   <h>Where is the Motive, they ask?
    <p>Oddly, unlike manipulating interest rates or exchange rates or oil
   prices or dairy prices or labor prices or what have you, "speaking"
   about the manipulation in gold prices is a grave taboo.

    <p>And there is an excellent reason for that. It is simply this: There
   has never been such a comparably long period of paper money prosperity
   as during this past thirty years or so, evidently. It is normally
   perceived that this kind of prosperity would not be possible on a gold
   standard; in as short a time as it is without one, at least. That is
   because on a gold standard, we have to accept some monetary discipline
   from time to time. On a "paper" monetary system, we can-will-and-have
   postponed the unkind "discipline," despite the fact that it comes at
   the expense of what is referred to as the lender-of-last-resort model.
   At some nearby point in the future this will probably come at an
   enormous cost. Conversely, on a theoretically proper gold standard,
   the average entrepreneur can at least be reasonably confident that he
   can keep any wealth that is conquered for longer than, say a couple of
   decades.

    <p>We have established this position many times in the past, and if you
   would like to review our arguments, please visit our homepage and pick
   out any one of our archived reports. You ought to at least agree that
   there has been a visible lack of financial discipline in recent years,
   whatever that may mean to you. So, when Dr. Jessica Cross suggests,
   through the FAZ, that organizations like GATA have not even touched
   on possible motive, she has clearly under read the content at any of
   the websites that we publish through, including GATA's.

   <p>In short form, it is my contention that ultimately this cost will
   manifest in a loss of confidence and purchasing power of the paper
   currency with the weakest fundamentals, which have less to do with any
   deceptive productivity edge, than they have to do with other more
   complex monetary issues, such as the natural consequences of
   profligate dollar imperialism. Nevertheless, by then we shall see
   where all of the false wealth has been transferred to, and we may then
   possibly even lose faith in the spin weaving banking system - dare I
   say it. And if we were so brave as to try and revert back to the
   coherent economic logic behind "sound money," which was responsible
   for many of the enormous and real economic expansions of previous
   centuries, the Federal Reserve System that was developed in 1908 may
   have to completely dismantle. That certainly explains the taboo, don't
   you think

   <p>Let me warn right now, that this line of reasoning, as logical as it
   indeed may be, ranks very high on the controversy scale. Why don't you
   practice it on your nearest neighbor and watch his or her haughty
   reaction, just for fun? This does not mean the argument is wrong, but
   will only reveal that your neighbor owns stocks. It took a long, long
   time for the Fed to become as powerful as it is today, where millions
   and millions of investors watch Mr. Greenspan's every single move, as
   if they knew what to do with the worthless information.

   <p>Given all of these circumstances, how hard do you think that it would
   be for any powerful financial interest today to persuade an "expert"
   to denounce such manipulation that everyone already knows exists? And
   if our economics are right, which they probably are, the motive for
   manipulating gold prices could not be greater at any time in history
   than it is today.

   <h>The Irony of Power
   <p>The only real mistake that the Fed had ever made, in terms of
   defending its power, was to allow the monetary inflation to overcome
   the economy and manifest in profuse quantities of low quality
   securities, which are now owned by too many weak hands. Here is the
   irony; these "hands" now have the power to decide the Fed's destiny.
   So yes, expect the "expert" nonsense to intensify, as there are few
   markets other than gold, where "they" may still exert an advantageous,
   and more direct influence. The next few years should prove very
   interesting to this argument.

   <h>Gold And Paper Have Become Mutually Exclusive
   <p>In her report, Dr. Jessica Cross examines the whole argument about
   gold derivatives and whether there exists any manipulation of gold
   prices at all. When I first glanced at the 200-page phase one project,
   I thought to myself, what a waste of %#&! time and money. Mine too.
   Nonetheless, it is my obligation to answer the call. In the preamble,
   Jessica states that:

   <p>"As Virtual Metals noted in the initial proposal for this study, any
   detailed research into the derivative phenomenon would probably
   generate as many questions as it provided answers. This has indeed
   been the case and consequently, it is acknowledged that further work
   is warranted. "

   <p>Here are a few of my "initial" stupid questions:
   <l> Who is going to actually study this enormous intimidating looking
   pile of bureaucratic nonsense before the presidential election is
   over?
   <l> Why did the World Gold Council assert their confidence in previous
   numbers at the Gold Conference in France only a few months ago, if
   they had yet to even complete such a study?
   <l> If there are many more questions now than before, where does she
   get off making any conclusions whatsoever about anything?

   <p>I suppose that one has to justify the scarce resources (she apparently
   is doing this work for the supposedly impoverished gold industry)
   allocated to this project undertaking that appears to be motivated
   mainly to discredit GATA's conclusions, and that is going to be hard
   to do if the conclusion is that GATA may actually be right.

   <h>Everybody Has A Vested Interest in Something
   <p>The FAZ reported the discovery that many of GATA's supporters have
   personal monetary interests behind their accusations. I am glad they
   noticed. I certainly do.

   <p>If these people want to accuse the little pissed off guys of having a
   vested interest in what they are talking about, I demand that they
   show me an example where that isn't the case for anyone else!!! I
   gather that I do not need to list many examples here.

   <p>The WGC and GFMS, representing the gold industry, unquestionably have
   a vested interest in keeping gold prices down, for example. At least
   until the industry's most important producers unwind their offside
   hedges. The evidence suggests that a significant "majority" of gold
   producers could lose a lot of money should gold prices double too
   quickly. In fact, such an event could easily escalate as the weaker
   producers would run into solvency problems and consequently, into
   production delays because they suddenly cannot afford to finance their
   daily operation. So yes, even the gold industry has a bearish vested
   interest in the Gold business today!

   <p>If these "people" really want to use that angle, I am sure that GATA
   can multiply it tenfold!

   <h>The Prisoner's Dilemma
   <p>Almost one year ago now, on the eve of the signing of the Washington
   Agreement, a friend of mine dubbed the situation a "prisoner's
   dilemma" because as long as no one else would cover their shorts all
   would be Ok, but under this theoretical quandary, such an outcome is
   obviously a Utopian fantasy. The Dr. Jessica Cross document looks more
   like a "prisoner's tale" than a revelation, created only to buy the
   prisoners some badly needed time while they all continue to cheat on
   each other. Though I have only studied a part of it so far, I am
   particularly thrilled with this comment in her report:

   <p>"This swift evolution (toward derivative products) is evidence that
   the derivatives are a natural and thriving concomitant of a free
   market in gold. Perhaps for this reason alone their presence should be
   accepted rather than eschewed. " 

   <p>The document must have been written by at least two different people!
   For one thing, in the first sentence of the overview on page 14 it is
   claimed that:

   <p>"This research neither endorses nor denounces the use of derivatives
   in general." 

   <p>These contradictory comments are only a few pages apart. Where is her
   credibility? Again, I will repeat for her own benefit if she ever
   reads this, that derivatives are indeed a natural evolution in a
   global economy that has developed on top of an unstable fiat monetary
   experiment, blah, blah and blah.

   <p>I really do not care what your credentials are. If you do not accept
   this argument because you are a paper bull, that is one thing, but if
   you do not accept this argument while you are supposedly representing
   the "gold" industry, you either don't know the first thing about money
   and credit, or you are a liar!

   <p>No wonder the FAZ claims that GATA hasn't sufficiently explained the
   motives behind why anyone would even want to manipulate gold prices -
   they obviously did not read or understand the diversity of arguments
   that GATA has worked hard to present. Dr. Jessica Cross should have
   spent more time studying economics than statistics or the anecdotal
   consensus in the cab driving industry, for then she might actually be
   able to see the forest.

   <h>What is so bad about Fiat anyhow?
   <p>Mr. Birnbaum, in a 1996 report to the Joint Economic Committee,
   concludes that the derivatives business is completely unnecessary were
   there to be less volatility in the free floating fiat exchange rate
   system in the first place. He makes the case, and if he doesn't I do,
   that this volatility is also unnecessary, and only exists as a result
   of an unstable and misguided (politicized) monetary policy. Thus, the
   enormous growth in the unnecessary derivatives business (which I am
   sure Dr. Cross has a vested interest in) is a direct consequence of
   this unnecessary exchange rate volatility.

   <p>A secondary result, he suggests, is that the business of the world has
   moved away from the real economy and has been dominated by asset
   speculation and general goods arbitrage. He is more right today than
   ever. In 1999, I observed this outcome on my own (captured nicely in
   the following chart by Alan Newman) and dubbed the US economy a stock
   market economy to my clients. However, many bulls still insist this is
   all on account of the new economy!


   <p>I'll say. Therefore, in this context, you bet that derivatives are a
   necessary evolution. That is not in question. The question is what
   happens next? Many economists have been trying to prove the growing
   instability of this monetary system, or systemic financial market
   risk, and anyone that works for the gold industry should be on the
   same bloody page. It seems that the biggest obstacle facing the gold
   business today, is that investors have forgotten what the value of
   gold really is. Who can blame them? After thirty years of spin, the
   facts have obviously become twisted and distorted, rendering the truth
   far, far away. End.

   <h>A proposition for my readers
   <p>In conclusion, I have a big problem with the way this overly lengthy
   report was presented. The first 40 pages or so contain summary
   conclusions, while the rest of the report (160 pages) details the
   "extensive" research put into these conclusions. Of course, I am far
   too polite to suggest that was the order in which the report was
   actually written. My bet is that only a very small minority of
   passionately interested parties will go beyond the assertions made in
   the first 40 pages. Do you get the picture?

   <p>So, here is the deal. Being one of these passionately interested
   parties, I will omit the conclusions and study the "extensive"
   research in the last 160 pages of the report this fall, and before the
   election! I will then write my own conclusions based on Dr. Jeckyll's
   analysis, and I will then compare my conclusions to the expert
   conclusions drawn by the esteemed "Dr." I will try not to make it a
   lengthy treatise and will only publish it if I get enough email
   requests to do so.

   <p>Thus, if you are interested in this analysis, please email me and note
   whether you would like the report mailed to your address or simply
   emailed to you. Of course, if you want a hard copy, you must enclose
   your mailing address for the sake of efficiency.
