   <h>JHU SAIS Co-Hosted an Exercise Illuminating Transatlantic Leaders
   Reactions to Bioterror Attack
   <p>Atlantic Storm Spotlights Need for Preparedness at International Level


   <p>The Johns Hopkins University Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced
   International Studies (SAIS) co-hosted a table-top exercise, Atlantic
   Storm, that simulated a smallpox attack on the nations of the
   transatlantic community. The ministerial bioterrorism exercise was
   presented by the SAIS Center for Transatlantic Relations , the Center
   for Biosecurity of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and
   the Transatlantic Biosecurity Network, on Friday, January 14, 2004.

   <p>During the exercise, which was held in Washington, DC, former prime
   ministers and other senior government officials from nations on both
   sides of the Atlantic played the roles of the heads of government of
   their respective nations in a mock summit.

   <p>The scenario presented to the participants was the simultaneous
   outbreak of smallpox in several cities: Istanbul, Frankfurt, and
   Rotterdam, with attacks in the U.S. surfacing later in the day. It was
   made clear early on that the disease had been spread deliberately, and
   a terrorist group claimed responsibility for the action.

   <p>The assembled world leaders debated the availability of vaccine in
   their countries and were surprised to learn that although some
   countries-including the U.S., the UK, France, Germany, and the
   Netherlands-had enough to vaccinate their entire populations, many
   countries do not. Italy and Sweden, for example, have enough vaccine
   for only 10% of their populations.

   <p>The issue of whether to use "ring" vaccination-that is, vaccinating
   those who have been in contact with patients, and health-care
   workers-or to opt for mass vaccination of the whole population led to
   discussions of which countries would be willing or politically able to
   share vaccine, pitting the "haves" against the "have-nots."

   <p>Acting as the U.S. President, Madeleine Albright expressed doubts as
   to whether the American people would be willing to give away a portion
   of the U.S. stockpile to European countries whose governments had been
   less than supportive of U.S. policies in the recent past.

   <p>"It was clear that this group of leaders all wanted to do the right
   thing, and they largely agreed on what that was," noted Tara O'Toole,
   CEO of the Center for Biosecurity. "But they were worried that their
   people were not prepared to accept the necessary decisions (sharing),
   and they at times felt compelled to take actions that might have bad
   implications for world."

   <p>As the day went on, the number of reported smallpox cases grew
   rapidly, and the number of countries whose populations were affected
   also increased. Cases were reported in the U.S., in Canada, and in
   Mexico, as well as in countries throughout Europe.

   <p>When the participants were told that dock workers in Rotterdam were
   infected and that the port had been closed, and that Polish citizens
   were streaming into Germany to try to obtain vaccine that was not
   available in their country, the assembled leaders were forced to
   confront the economic and political consequences of the crisis. A
   debate ensued about the advisability of closing borders, quarantining
   cities, and limiting the movement of people and goods.

   <p>In a discussion after the exercise had concluded, many of the players
   expressed surprise that their countries had not stockpiled enough
   vaccine. Several agreed that there was not sufficient awareness at the
   highest levels of governments on both sides of the Atlantic of the
   possibility and consequences of such a bioterrorist act.

   <p>It was also clear to the participants that no organization or
   structure, including NATO, the EU, and the UN, is now agile enough to
   respond to the challenges posed by a bioterrorist attack of this scope
   and complexity. The participants wanted the WHO to manage the
   distribution of vaccine, but former WHO Director-General Gro Harlem
   Brundtland admitted that its resources were limited and were already
   stretched by the tsunami relief response. She reminded the others that
   the annual WHO budget is "about as big as that of a middle-sized
   English hospital."

   <p>"A bioterrorist attack will immediately be an international crisis,"
   said O'Toole, "and countries must be able to communicate and
   coordinate response in near-real time. Atlantic Storm has shown how
   critical it is for leaders to be prepared to respond to bioterrorist
   attacks of international dimensions requiring stark and extraordinary
   decisions."

   <p>The participants in the mock summit included:

   <l> Madeleine Albright, former U.S. Secretary of State, playing the part
   of the President of the United States;

   <l> Sir Nigel Broomfield, former Ambassador of the UK to Germany,
   playing the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom;

   Director-General of the World Health Organization, playing the
   Director-General of WHO;

   <l> Jerzy Buzek, former Primer Minister of Poland, playing the Prime
   Minister of Poland;

   <l> Klaas de Vries, former Minister of the Interior of the Netherlands,
   playing the Prime Minister of the Netherlands;

   Minister of Sweden;

   <l> Wener Hoyer, member of the German Bundestag and former German Deputy
   Minister of Foreign Affairs, playing the Chancellor of the Federal
   Republic of Germany;

   <l> Bernard Kouchner, former Minister of Health of France, playing the
   President of France;

   of the European Commission;
