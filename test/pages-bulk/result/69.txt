<h>Wilson, North Carolina Fire Department

   
<p>HP teamed with ESRI to provide a sophisticated solution for Wilson's "Fire
Department of the Future" GIS initiative.

<p>   Last September, public safety officials in Wilson, N.C., confronted a
   nightmarish scenario: The police department's SWAT team arrested a man
   suspected of building explosive devices in his home. After his
   capture, the suspect told officers he'd planted a bomb in the house
   that was ready to explode.
    
 <p>   Facing a hazard of unknown proportions, police officers called Wilson
   Fire/Rescue Services, which moved quickly to protect citizens in the
   surrounding neighborhood. "We pulled up our GIS system on a terminal
   in one of our trucks.We pinpointed the house on the map, and it gave
   us an evacuation zone," said Chief Don Oliver, of Wilson Fire/Rescue
   Services. "We could identify the houses we needed to evacuate by
   address, so we got everybody out."
   
  <p> With citizens out of harm's way, police used a robotic device to
   remove the bomb from the house and disarm it in the street. "It took
   us 12 hours to resolve the situation, but there was not a single
   injury," Oliver said.
   
<p>   The incident offers a dramatic example of how Wilson Fire/Rescue uses
   mobile GIS technology to safeguard residents of this 50,000-member
   community in eastern North Carolina. Working closely with HP, the
   rural fire department has become a model for using geospatial
   information to improve firefighters' decision-making and
   effectiveness.
  
<p>  HP teamed with ESRI to provide a sophisticated solution for Wilson's
   "Fire Department of the Future" GIS initiative. The project relies on
   HP business-critical servers, high-performance workstations and
   networking equipment. HP technology provides a powerful, reliable
   infrastructure for running ESRI's advanced GIS mapping applications.
   
<p>   The fire department tapped into the city's existing GIS system for
   information on streets, water lines and hydrants, electrical and gas
   lines, and building and zoning specifications.
   
<p>   A GIS fire analysis application allowed the department to add
   specialized information such as incident reports and fire inspection
   records into its system. GIS data generated by the system is loaded
   into computer terminals that are mounted in Wilson's firefighting
   vehicles. In addition, HP notebooks and handhelds help deliver GIS
   maps wherever they are needed. "We run about 4,000 calls a year,"
   Oliver said."What we're doing is taking technology and applying it to
   decision-making in the emergency-service field."
  
<p>  Launched in 2000, the initiative provides new technology tools to
   address the firefighting needs of a changing city. Once one of the
   world's largest tobacco markets, Wilson's economy gradually is
   shifting from agriculture to manufacturing and pharmaceuticals. "We
   have three and a half million square feet of warehouse space that is
   used for storing everything from rubber to pesticides," Oliver said.
   
<p>   Wilson uses GIS technology to give them the answers.
  
<p>  One byproduct of Wilson's changing economic base is a large number of
   vacant commercial buildings which Oliver cites as the city's largest
   firefighting hazard. Firefighters attacking a blaze in one of these
   buildings confront a series of questions: Is the building locked up?
   Can they be relatively certain that no one is inside? Is the building
   structurally sound? Could potentially hazardous materials still be
   stored inside?
   
 <p>  The department identified every vacant commercial structure in the
   city, rated its condition and plotted the data on a GIS map. Buildings
   were put into one of four color-coded categories based on their
   potential danger. Categories ranged from green for structurally sound
   and secure, to red for abandoned and dangerous the latter being judged
   too hazardous to enter under any circumstances.
   
 <p>  GIS maps showing the shape, size, location and condition of vacant
   buildings were loaded into computer terminals mounted in the
   department's fire trucks."So now, when the fire captain crawls into
   his rig, he enters the address and brings up a picture of the
   building," said Oliver. "That tells him straight up whether he's going
   to be able to make an offensive or defensive attack on the fire."
   
<p>   Geospatial information helps Wilson Fire/Rescue improve firefighter
   and citizen safety in other ways, too. Like any fire department,Wilson
   strives to make the best use of limited personnel and assets. GIS
   technology gave fire officials bold new insight into how and where to
   deploy resources.
   
<p>   "You know the old adage, 'A picture is worth a thousand words?' Well,
   it's true," said Oliver. "If I can show you a problem, rather than
   tell you about the problem, you'll understand it a lot quicker."
   
<p>   For example, the department moved one of its two light squad companies
   across town after GIS information showed the squad was stationed in
   the wrong place. "One of the primary responsibilities for these
   companies is to respond first to emergency medical calls, saving wear
   and tear on our larger trucks," Oliver said."We had them in what we
   thought was the most centrally located stations in the city. But we
   found out that one of our engine companies was responding to over 600
   EMS calls a year, and one squad had only responded to 143."
   
 <p>  Since its relocation, the squads cover the majority of EMS calls in
   the city. "We provide better service now than we ever have," said
   Oliver."And we didn't make that decision until we put it on a map and
   looked at the picture."
   
<h>   Expanding scope
   
<p>   Using its fire analysis software,Wilson has begun applying geospatial
   analysis to data stored in its records management system. That insight
   helps the department identify patterns and eliminate risks that might
   otherwise go unnoticed.
  
<p>  For example, analysis of the department's emergency medical calls
   pinpointed locations where traffic accidents occurred frequently.
   Armed with that information, the fire department convinced city
   planners to install new traffic signals and reconfigure intersections.
  
 <p> "Where we're really making a difference is being able to convey
   information taking data and creating pictures that show how we can
   mitigate issues before they become major problems," Oliver said.
   
 <p>  The chief would like to start applying those capabilities to other
   areas as well.
   
<p>   "We're looking at getting notebooks that our fire inspectors can carry
   with them in the field when they perform inspections," he said. "I
   would also like to see all architectural drawings that are approved by
   the city become available electronically, so we could have the most
   current configuration for buildings loaded in our system."
  
<p>  Oliver expects GIS maps to help the department strengthen its fire
   safety education programs too. Although the city's economy is
   changing,Wilson still has a large population of migrant agricultural
   workers, many of whom cannot speak English. GIS maps can help show
   where these workers tend to live and congregate, allowing the
   department to focus bilingual fire-safety programs where they will
   have the most impact.
   
 <h>  Spreading the word
   
<p>   Given the program's current accomplishments and its promise for the
   future,Wilson Fire/Rescue entertains a steady stream of fire officials
   from other jurisdictions who stop by to observe the progress.
   
<p>   "I can't tell you how many departments have been here Atlanta,
   Raleigh, Charlotte, Durham.We're sharing the story," said Oliver. He
   also appears regularly at public-safety association meetings to
   present information on Wilson's project.
   
 <p>  Oliver views his department's use of geospatial information and
   sophisticated computing equipment as a model for other firefighting
   agencies to follow. The city has become a proving ground for applying
   advanced information solutions to the business of firefighting. And
   working in close partnership with HP,Wilson Fire/Rescue Services
   clearly is proving that GIS technology helps provide safer
   communities.
  
 <p> "I've got the best fire department in the world. These folks are
   committed, they're energetic, and they want to do the best job they
   can. And we're giving them the tools to do it better every day,"
   Oliver said. "We're covering calls better and more quickly so we're
   cutting down on the number of large fires we have. We're getting to
   them at an earlier stage.
   
<p>   "The truth is," he said,"this technology has raised the level of
   service and safety for Wilson's citizens and our firefighters."
