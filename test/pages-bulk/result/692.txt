<h>A Healthy Prognosis

<h>Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida ensures adequate product pricing with
SASÂ® Activity-Based Management


   <p>From retirees and recent immigrants to typical working-class Americans
   and their dependents, Florida boasts one of the most diverse
   populations in the United States, ranking No. 4 in population among
   the 50 states. No matter their demographic differences, the 16 million
   residents of Florida have one thing in common: the need for
   affordable, reliable health insurance.

   <p>With such a large population base and variety of employers, the field
   of insurers vying for their business is as bustling as the Sunshine
   State itself. However, the diversity of the population also reflects
   the diversity of the employer groups being underwritten. To stay ahead
   of the competition, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida (BCBSF) uses
   SAS Activity-Based ManagementÂ to measure the detailed costs of doing
   business in order to balance pricing products competitively with
   adequately funding the risk and ensuring a fair profit margin. SAS
   facilitates product profitability reporting, providing a detailed
   analysis of product profitability by customer and customer
   profitability by product.

   <p>"In the mid-1990s, we knew we must understand the cost of our products
   to help us determine pricing as well as analyze profitability,"
   explains Lee Boardman, director of accounting for BCBSF's Diversified
   Business Sector. "We also wanted to gain efficiencies and, in general,
   get a better handle on our costs. With SAS, we're accomplishing that."

   <p>The Diversified Business Sector offers ancillary products that
   complement health insurance â such as life insurance, disability
   insurance, dental insurance, workers' compensation and long-term care.
   Some are sold at fixed prices, although benefits may be paid far
   beyond the date sold. So having access to precise cost information is
   crucial to ensuring that products are priced accurately.

   <p>"Our challenge was to maintain product profitability and support
   effective product management in a highly competitive market," he
   explains. "Therefore, we needed a good understanding of the activity
   cost of providing our products and services."

   <h>Claims Processed 90 Percent Faster
   <p>In one instance, Boardman's group used SAS to help show a profit with
   a disability product that had previously reported high administrative
   costs. BCBSF performs third-party administrator services for
   self-funded disability plans. Using SAS, BCBSF discovered that the
   administrative fee it was charging did not cover the internal cost of
   administering the claims process.

   <p>"As a separate project, we identified manual processes â such as
   weekly check-writing, claim-payment reporting, and tax-withholding and
   payment processing â that could be automated to save time and money,"
   Boardman says. "By using SAS to identify inefficiencies, we were able
   to reduce the time required to process disability claims by 90
   percent. The cost per claim has decreased from more than $80 to $20.
   SAS helped make this disability product profitable."

   <p>Profitability reporting enhances the expense management process.
   Departmental expense analyses by product helps managers see costs in
   terms of activities. Managers can see unit costs to improve efficiency
   and direct work efforts appropriately. "Product-level cost information
   is developed for business and operational planning and decision
   making," Boardman says. "Actual expenses by product are captured and
   compared with planning assumptions to monitor variances from the
   profit plan and to troubleshoot problems."

   <p>Discovering the true costs of offering a product can sometimes lead to
   rate increases for customers. But customers don't seem to mind as long
   as they understand why BCBSF is asking them to pay more. BCBSF does
   this by documenting and reporting to the customer the group's actual
   costs in comparison to rates paid. "We've had three customers for whom
   we've had to triple rates, and they've stayed with us," Boardman says.
   "Their only other option was to get canceled, and they chose to stay.
   SAS is helping us show our customers the value of doing business with
   us."

   <p>Other uses of SAS Activity-Based Management at BCBSF include:
     <l> Determining inter-company service costs and supporting product
     <l> Building and analyzing trend data to support profitability
       management.
     <l> Forecasting costs for future business opportunities.

   <p>"We've gained a lot more from it than we originally expected,
   especially in terms of assisting with forecasting and planning,"
   Boardman says. "For example, when we were working on our mid-year
   assessment, everything we had â profitability reports by customer,
   detailed cost versus budget information â came from SAS Activity-Based
   Management. It helped us to see where we'll be by the end of the year,
   so it's a tremendous solution."

   <p>By incorporating activity costs and budget figures by month, BCBSF
   managers can compare budget to actual and drill into activities to
   find out more detailed information about costs to uncover
   inefficiencies.

   <p>"SAS Activity-Based Management has proven to have a significant value
   as both a pricing and management tool," Boardman says.
