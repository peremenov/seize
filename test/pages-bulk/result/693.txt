<h>1879 - The Tay Bridge Disaster


   <p>Designed by Sir Thomas Bouch, the Tay Railway Bridge was opened in
   1878.

   <p>The single-track bridge was a box construction with numerous
   box-section legs, up to 230ft apart, supporting the steam trains up to
   88ft in the air as they snaked for almost two miles over the Tay and
   Perth-bound shipping. Bouch had not designed his structure with the
   estuary winds considered in his calculations, nor had the contractor
   been supervised to prevent his use of badly manufactured material.

   <p>These points were discovered after the bridge's central sections
   failed during the stormy night of 28 December 1879 while a train was
   crossing. The train, with seventy five passengers and crew, poured off
   the collapsing bridge into the icy river with all lives lost.
   
   <p>Bouch, who was held entirely responsible, could not take the strain
   either and died shortly after the inquiry. When travelling on the 1887
   replacement bridge over the Tay, the bases of the original's
   supporting legs can be seen along the eastern side, reaching out of
   the cold water, a disturbing sight on a stormy crossing.

   <p>William McGonagall remembers the night of the 28th well in his famous
   poem `Railway Bridge of the Silvery Tay'.
