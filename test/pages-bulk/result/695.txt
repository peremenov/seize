<h>BOOKING CONDITIONS

   <h>CONDITIONS
   <p>Scottish Tours Ltd (the Company) accepts you (the Passenger) booking
   under the following terms and conditions.

   <h>SMOKING
   <p>Smoking is not allowed on motorcoaches. Motorcoaches make regular
   stops for passengers who wish to smoke.

   <h>CANCELLATIONS
   <p>The Company reserves the right to cancel any tour for any reason
   beyond the control of the company. In such cases the limit of the
   Companys liability to the Passenger is the return of any monies paid
   by the Passenger for the element of the holiday booked by the Company.

   <p>Where the Passenger cancels the tour reservation the effective date of
   cancellation will be the date on which the Company receives written
   notification of the Passengers intention to cancel their tour
   reservation. In the event of cancellation by the Passenger a
   cancellation charge calculated on the scale below shall become
   immediately payable by the Passenger.

   <p>The Company reserves the right in its absolute discretion to refuse to
   carry any person whose conduct or manner causes or is likely to cause
   offence or upset to other passengers. In such cases full cancellation
   charges will apply and the Company shall have no further liability to
   that Passenger.
   <h>LUGGAGE
   <p>The passenger may bring one suitcase and one carry-on bag per person.
   The Company will allow any additional luggage to be carried, subject
   to space being available. The Company will take reasonable care of
   Passengers luggage, but limits its liability to a maximum claim or
   aggregate of claims of Â£200 for damage to, or theft or loss of
   Passengers luggage. Suitable insurance is easily available and
   passengers are strongly advised to obtain this prior to travel.

   <h>MOTORCOACHES
   <p>The Company reserves the right to alter the type of motorcoach used on
   any tour and to substitute a smaller sized motorcoach in the event of
   less than 20 passengers travelling on any tour departure. The Company
   shall use its reasonable endeavours to provide the advertised
   specification of vehicle for all journeys although this cannot always
   be guaranteed.

   <h>ALTERATIONS BY THE COMPANY
   <p>Whilst the Company shall use its reasonable endeavours to provide your
   tour as planned, the Company reserves the right to alter itineraries
   in any way, and for whatever reason, or to vary accommodation. In the
   case of accommodation alternative accommodation of a similar standard
   will be obtained.

   <h>SUPPLIERS OF SERVICES
   <p>Tickets for steamships, aircraft, trains or other carriers which are
   obtained by the Company on behalf of the Passenger are subject to the
   conditions of carriage of the individual carrier. The Company
   undertakes to select hotels, restaurants and coach companies which
   have a good reputation. The company will not accept or have any
   liability for the acts of omissions whether negligent or otherwise, of
   ferry companies, coach operators, hotels or any other person providing
   services in connection with the arrangements of the group/
   individual(s) unless such a person is employed by the Company or
   subject to the Companys direct control.

   <h>MISCELLANEOUS
   <p>If any provision of these conditions is deemed to be invalid, illegal
   or unenforceable under any applicable statute or rule of law, it shall
   to that extent be deemed omitted and the remaining provisions shall
   remain valid and enforceable and shall not be affected or impaired in
   any way.

   <p>The Company is dedicated to providing Passengers with a reliable and
   fault free service. In the unlikely event that a Passenger wishes to
   raise any queries or complaints with the Company, such query or
   complaint should be raised in the first instance with the tour
   driver/guide, who will endeavour to resolve the situation to the
   Passengers. If any complaint cannot be resolved by the tour

   the Company within one month from the last day of the tour provided by
   the Company.

   or events beyond the reasonable control of the Company.

   jurisdiction of the Scottish Courts.
