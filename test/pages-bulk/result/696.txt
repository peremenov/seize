   <h>How high street retailers can win customers through search engines

   <p>Retail Week wrote a feature triggered by Screen Pages' report on how
   high street retailers do search engines, entitled "Seek and you shall
   find" by Liz Morrell.

   <p>High street retailers would never dream of opening a store, then not
   tell customers where it is or refuse to let them in. Yet this is
   effectively what many high street giants are doing when they fail to
   understand the usefulness of search engines as a driver of traffic to
   their web site.

   <p>Search engines account for more than 80 per cent of all internet
   traffic. According to search engine optimisation and web site
   promotion services company Ambergreen, more than 70 per cent of all
   e-commerce transactions originate from a search and over 60 per cent
   of users visit search sites every month.

   <p>"If your site is not optimised - or even worse, optimised badly - the
   chances of your online business being found are virtually
   non-existent," says an Ambergreen spokesman.

   <p>E-commerce solution provider Screen Pages head of online marketing Tim
   Ireland, author of a recent report into the performance of high street
   retailers on search engines, says: "It's an overly complacent retailer
   that doesn't actively pursue market share. Potential shoppers, who use
   generic searches or seek specific products or product types via search
   engines, should be looked upon as new customers or potential converts
   to a brand. In the real world, attracting footfall in stores is a
   critical trading issue. Gaining market share in single-digit
   percentage points from the competition consumes much management and
   board attention."

   <p>However, management is failing to address the issue. "Ultimately, it's
   a lack of awareness. Even the ones who do know about it are not
   addressing it properly or effectively. It's a management issue," says
   Screen Pages managing director Roger Willcocks.

   <p>Lysander Meath Baker, director of internet consultancy Digivate, says
   most high street retailers have the wrong online priorities. "The
   majority see the internet as a form of above-the-line marketing. In
   other words, many retailers see the web as a promotional tool that
   costs money, not a transactional channel that makes money," he says.

   <p>James Roper, chief executive of e-tail body IMRG, says the web has
   slipped down the agenda with the high street management boards as they
   focus efforts on competing in a toughening bricks-and-mortar world. "I
   don't think the boards of the big companies are even looking at it,"
   Roper says.

   <h>Ignorance is no bliss

   <p>Using their bricks-and-mortar stores as justification for doing
   nothing is no excuse, according to Roper. "Then you are missing out on
   all the other searches where customers are researching online, but buy
   in-store - you can't ignore that," he says.

   <p>High street retailers are also failing to understand how people shop,
   assuming they will be searching only for their brand name. According
   to Screen Pages, an estimated 1 million UK web visitors use the search
   term Tesco every month in the Yahoo! and Google search engines
   combined, but a further 500,000 use the terms shopping and home
   shopping.

   <p>Carphone Warehouse head of e-commerce Andy Harding says search engine
   optimisation is vitally important for the mobile phone and telecoms
   retailer and is one of the key sources of traffic to its site. "We get
   a lot of people coming directly to the Carphone Warehouse site, but we
   are not arrogant enough to think we can just live by that." He says
   the retailer, despite its brand name, must also rank by specific
   models of phone to avoid missing out on sales. "It you are not listed
   there, no matter how strong your brand is, a customer may not even
   consider you," he explains.

   <p>Forrester Research analyst Hellen Omwanda says that the dotcom boom
   and bust combined with the failure of online banner ads means that
   high street retailers remain wary. "Part of the reason is the general
   attitude that high street retailers have to internet marketing. It's
   about them being convinced it's not just hype," she says. "But it's
   not hype. It's great in terms of conversions, because you are
   capturing a customer who is ready to make a purchase."

   <p>High street retailers must also make this form of marketing a priority
   if they are to avoid losing out to their pure-play rivals. "The
   smartest people are the likes of Figleaves.com, which has a whole top
   team of people, (search engines) is all that they do, they are
   constantly buying links and keywords. It's about absolutely having
   your finger on the pulse," says Roper.

   <p>Willcocks agrees. "Because they are executing well in their niche they
   are getting results and nicking business from these people (high
   street retailers) who are sleeping giants. Market-savvy retailers can
   beat the retailers with the biggest marketing budgets just by being
   clever with their search engine marketing," he says.

   <p>But few are. Typing almost any product category into search engines
   such as Google will bring up pages of relevant links, but high street
   retailers are rarely listed on the first page of results.

   <h>First come first served

   <p>According to the Screen Pages report, 30 per cent of searchers will
   click on the top three results and another 20 per cent on one of the
   other results on the first page of links returned. If retailers aren't
   within the first page or so of returns they are unlikely to get enough
   customers visiting their site.

   <p>Improving a retailer's ranking within the search engines is not a
   difficult process. "Ultimately, it's about making sure the site is
   readable," says Willcocks. This means having simply designed sites. "A
   lot of retail sites have a Flash front page and Google can't get past
   that so the site is invisible to the spiders (the indexing robots that
   gather data for sites)," says Jason Woodford, development director at
   internet marketing consultancy Academy Internet. If the indexing robot
   can't get into the site it simply gives up and moves on.

   <p>The Screen Pages report showed Habitat and Topshop had sites that were
   almost 100 per cent Flash and, therefore, had very few products
   visible to the search engine user. "Flashy, dynamic web sites may look
   good, but they are harder to rank naturally. Good detailed product
   descriptions and images when the user arrives, a simple transaction
   process and not trying to capture too much data leading up to the
   transaction can help boost natural ranking," says Rob Wilson, director
   of search engine marketing company 24/7 Search.

   <p>Meath Baker says it is a case of concentrating on usability over
   design. "Many retailers employ web design firms with little or no
   experience of building online shops. This leads to sites that are very
   good looking and funky, but a pain to use. Ironically, a focus on the
   way the brand looks often leads to slow and hard-to-use sites that
   probably damage the brand," he says.

   <p>The second step is about having the right keywords in the right
   places. "You need to make sure your copywriting describes your
   products effectively," says Woodford.

   <p>The final step is to ensure the site is well linked internally and
   externally to improve its page ranking on the search engine web sites.
   This ensures that the search engines realise your site is important,
   because it is referenced in so many places. "In terms of retail, the
   top rankers are the online giants Amazon and eBay," says Screen Pages.

   <h>Natural selection

   <p>As well as improving the visibility of their site among the natural
   ranking of a search engine is the ability for retailers to appear in
   the sponsored results searches by using pay-per-click.

   <p>Although retailers should be concentrating on improving their natural
   search engine rankings, pay-per-click advertising - where retailers
   bid on keywords to be top of the rankings for sponsored search engine
   results - is useful for short-term marketing campaigns or high-margin
   products because it can drive traffic straight to your site. "You need
   to focus on optimising your web site for the left-hand side because
   then traffic will come to your site for free," says Woodford.
   "High-volume products need to go on the left-hand side, because
   otherwise they will cost you lots of money (as sponsored links)," he
   says.

   <p>Pay-per-click also works well for those retailers that don't make it
   to the first page or so of natural searches or for those smaller or
   newer companies that want to up their profile.

   <p>"Not everyone can appear on the first page in the natural listings and
   on the lower pages the traffic just isn't significant enough to
   produce an adequate amount of sales. If you do a search for any item
   you can literally get millions of responses. The beauty is with
   pay-per-click you can get to number one in five minutes," says David
   Erasmus, managing director of Eyelevel, a company specialising in
   pay-per-click advertising.

   <p>Such paid for, or sponsored, search results have a rough click through
   rate of between 5 and 10 per cent according to Screen Pages.

   <p>Paul Whittaker is sales and marketing director of web site business
   Bathrooms365.com. A pay-per-click ad strategy has enabled him to
   compete against more established rivals. "Handled correctly
   pay-per-click advertising campaigns provide a useful short-term
   solution to gaining increased sales by thrusting your company and
   product to the front of the queue," he says.

   <p>Roper says retailers must be careful what keywords they use. "What the
   big brands do wrong is they buy keywords like computer or toaster. The
   smart guys like Dabs will go into specific keywords for products," he
   says.

   <p>"You can be generic, but if you are a niche retailer you want to buy
   niche keywords - such as wide fitting boots rather than just boots,"
   says Woodford.

   <p>Erasmus agrees: "A lot of advertising methods are very canvassing,
   With this you can choose your keywords in such a targeted way that
   every click will result in a lead," he says.

   <p>Because of the cost of pay-per-click advertising, being specific
   literally pays off. "Retailers tend to concentrate on high-traffic
   terms and enter into aggressive bidding strategies with their
   competitors, hiking up marketing costs," says Wilson.

   <p>Roper says: "Pay-per-click can be good for short-term campaigns, but
   it can also be a black hole into which you are shovelling money if you
   are buying the wrong links." He says the bidding process associated
   with pay-per-click also means costs are rising. Carphone Warehouse
   uses both methods, but this is likely to change. "We see organic
   listings as being more important for the future, because of the
   increasing cost of pay-per-click," says Harding.

   <p>However, the immediacy and measurability of the web also means
   retailers can experiment with pay-per-click marketing. "You can start
   it today and get results tomorrow," says Willcocks.

   <p>Woodford agrees. "You can be straight up on the front page in five
   minutes. In traditional marketing, it's difficult to know what your
   return on investment is, but in pay-per-click you can see how much
   revenue you have generated," he says.

   <p>Ignorance and complacency is no longer an excuse. Roper says retailers
   must invest in search engine marketing. "If people want to thrive in
   this space they need to apply their minds to understanding it."

   <p>Willcocks agrees: "It's a crying shame that these world-class
   companies are not investing properly in understanding this and those
   that do are not executing well, yet it's money for old rope."

   <p>In an online world that allows Joe Bloggs to compete with John Lewis,
   high street retailers cannot afford to stand still - unless they want
   to continue losing out.

   <h>SEARCH ENGINE ACTION PLAN

   <l> Work with online shop experts rather than general web design firms

   <l> Ask your web designer what they have done to ensure your site ranks
   highly in search engine results

   <l> Learn from the niche and pure-play retailers that are doing it well
   and stealing your business

   <l> Insist on site structures and technology that allow for full search
   engine visibility - avoid Flash and complicated design

   <l> Set up an ongoing program to manage pay-per-click keywords and
   search engine optimisation

   <l> Understand that a search engine-optimised site won't cost much more
   to build - if anything - than an invisible site

   <h>HIGH STREET RETAILERS IN SEARCH ENGINES

   <p>In Only 28 per cent of high street retailers have broad coverage of
   their web site's pages in the major search engines

   <l> Only 50 per cent of high street retailers surveyed showed evidence
   of a search engine strategy

   <l> Of those that did only 5 per cent had page one search results in
   Google for generic search terms and only two made it to the top three
   results for their primary search term

   <l> Less than 40 per cent had no keywords in their category and product
   pages and only 22 per cent had internet-friendly page titles

   <l> Only two retailers had taken full care to ensure all their pages
   could be indexed by search engines and only 22 per cent paid attention
   to indexing robots (the automated programs sent out by search engines
   to read and index web sites)

   <l> Only 22 per cent have high street-grade page ranks (measure of site
   importance) in Google

   <p>Source: Screen Pages survey of 18 high street retailers (Tesco, Asda,
   Debenhams, Marks & Spencer, John Lewis, Bhs, Woolworths, WHSmith,
   Dixons, Comet, Currys, Habitat, Boots, B&Q, Argos, Mothercare, Next
   and Topshop)

   <h>TOP SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMISATION TIPS

   <p>Anchor text: make sure your hyperlinks contain your keywords/key
   phrases of the landing page. Search engines like this as it shows
   relevance for that particular keyword. Never write "click here to find
   out more".

   <p>Content is king: Good content and proper use of it can result in
   excellent search engine ranking.

   <p>Dynamic sites: Is your site dynamic? If it is, potential customers
   will be able to find your homepage, but it may be difficult to find
   pages deeper within your site.

   <p>Flash: Got a Flash site? Search engines cannot read Flash and you will
   need a lot of help to optimise your site.

   <p>Frames: Is your web site built using frames? If it is you will have
   problems ranking highly on any search engine.

   <p>Keywords and copywriting: Just as important as the title tag. It is
   not just humans that read your web pages, search engine spiders also
   read the words and both audiences must be catered for. There should be
   between 200 and 750 words on each page. The text should contain your
   most important keywords and phrases, keywords that are in your tags,
   and should also read perfectly so as not to confuse the human reader.
   Add additional copy-filled pages to your site, such as how-to
   articles, tips and tutorials.

   <p>Linking: Your search engine ranking is influenced by the link
   popularity of your site. This is determined by how many other web
   sites link to your own.

   <p>Metatags: They are not as important as they were in the past but they
   still have some value in search engine optimisation (SEO).

   <p>Tagging: Adding alt tags to the images on your web site will not only
   help with SEO, but can help make your site more accessible. Label your
   images with a description of that particular image and try to include
   your keywords or key phrases where relevant.

   <p>Web site submission: Have you submitted your web site to relevant
   smaller directories and local listings sites as well as the major
   search engines and directories? This can help with both visibility and
   increasing your link popularity.

   <p>Never, never, never ...

   <l> List your keywords. It does not work and you may be blacklisted by
   search engines.

   <l> Hide keywords by using the same colour text as background of the
   page.

   <l>Submit identical pages to search engines and directories.

   <l> Try to trick search engines because it will lead to you being seen
   as a spammer and your whole site could be blacklisted.
