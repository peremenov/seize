     <p>Ignoring the Demand of Justice To Make Restitution
     <h>More on Wage-Cheating in China
     <p>At a toy factory in China, a management memo told workers how they
     should prepare for an upcoming inspection by an outside monitoring
     team. They were to memorize false numbers for their wages and
     working hours, inflating the wages and lowering the hours in order
     to reflect standards under Chinese laws. And they were promised
     bonuses for lying to the inspectors.
     <p>That is among the revelations contained in a front-page article,
     "Ruse in Toyland: Chinese Workers' Hidden Woe," published in the
     December 7 issue of the New York Times as part of its series on
     "The World's Sweatshop," China.  The article focuses on a factory
     near Hong Kong, Kin Ki Industrial, whose 850 workers, mostly
     teen-age girls, make the popular Etch A Sketch drawing toys for the
     Ohio Art Company in Bryan, Ohio.
     <p>Workers at the plant told the Times reporter, Joseph Kahn, that if
     the company were to pay legal wages, their pay for a month would
     more than double, to about $200 from $86. A senior Kin Ki executive
     first disputed these figures, but after also claiming that the
     company complies strictly with all Chinese laws, he acknowledged
     that its wages and benefits did fall short of legal requirements.
     Moreover, Kin Ki company documents obtained by the Times, Kahn
     writes, "show that it has been paying below-regulation wages -- and
     seeking to fool foreign clients -- for years."
     <h>Toy Industry 'Well Aware' of Law-Breaking, U.S. Industry Chief Says
     <p>If those and other damning facts detailed in the lengthy article
     were untrue, they would be challenged by the international toy
     business' leading spokesperson, Tom Conley, president of the trade
     association once called the Toy Manufacturers of America, which
     three years ago renamed itself the Toy Industry Association (since
     80% of all toys sold in the United States are manufactured in
     China). Instead of disputing Kahn's facts, Conley makes this
     admission in a letter published in the December 14 Times: "The toy
     industry is well aware that some Chinese toy factories are not
     complying with Chinese laws."
     <p>So what does he propose to do about the violations, especially
     those that cheat workers out of their lawful wages? He offers only
     an expanded program of independent inspections that "leave no room
     for the kind of deceit" that the Times has revealed.  But the
     problem is not merely deceit but cheating -- robbing workers of
     their wages over a period of years.  Justice requires making
     restitution. Conley ignores that demand of justice. So does the
     code of conduct that he extols as "the real solution" -- the
     International Council of Toy Industries' Code of Business
     Practices.
     <p>Workers at the unionized plant of the Ohio Art Company in Bryan,
     Ohio, made Etch A Sketches for 40 years before its owners three
     years ago decided to move production to China. One reason, its
     executives told Kahn, was the soaring cost of health insurance. In
     China the Kin Ki production workers have no health insurance.
     <p>They also have no union. Last summer a brief strike caused Kin Ki
     to raise wages a few cents a day and improve canteen food slightly,
     but two strike leaders soon were no longer on the payroll.
     According to management, they left voluntarily. According to
     workers,  management fired them -- made "fried squid" out of them,
     in local parlance.
     <p>The toy industry has a long history of highly profitable growth
     based on exploiting young women from China's rural areas. See, for
     example, "Our Children Don't Need Blood-Stained Toys," published in
     HRFW eight years ago, and an article of mine, "Toying with Lives,"
     published in American Educator a year ago. For highlights from a
     previous Kahn article in the Times series, see "China Is World's
     Sweatshop -- Who Cares?"

     <h>How Killing Workers Goes Unpunished
     <p>"Workers decapitated on assembly lines, shredded in machinery,
     burned beyond recognition, electrocuted, buried alive -- all of
     them killed, investigators concluded, because their employers
     willfully violated workplace safety laws."
     <p>Is that a description of avoidable workplace fatalities in China?
     No, this is a scandal made in the USA. The deaths happen here at
     the rate of 100 workers a year as a result of "intentional
     wrongdoing or plain indifference" by employers. And, despite U.S.
     respect for the rule of law, the offending employers are almost
     never prosecuted.
     <p>Those are among the startling findings of an intensive New York
     Times investigation that resulted in what the Times calls "the
     first systematic accounting of how this nation confronts employers
     who kill workers by deliberately violating workplace safety laws."
     A few of the other findings disclosed in a December 22 article by
     David Barstow:
     <l> Although causing the death of a worker by willfully violating U.S.
       occupational safety laws is a federal crime, from 1982 to 2002 the
       federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
       declined to seek prosecutions in 93% of the cases in which the
       agency itself concluded that the workers had died because of
       "willful" safety violations by employers.
     <l> Moreover, repeat offenders got off easy. "Having avoided
       prosecution once, at least 70 employers willfully violated safety
       laws again, resulting in scores of additional deaths. Even these
       repeat violators were rarely prosecuted," Barstow writes.
     <l> In the OSHA bureaucracy "victims' families are frozen out, but
       companies adeptly work the rules in their favor." Since 1990 OSHA
       has increasingly bowed "to employer demands that it replace the
       word 'willful' with 'unclassified' in citations involving
       workplace deaths...even for employers who have repeatedly shown a
       deliberate disregard for safety laws, resulting in multiple
       deaths."
     <l> In two decades OSHA's enforcement of the law has led to jail
       sentences totaling fewer than 30 years. In a single year, 2001,
       the Environmental Protection Agency obtained prison sentences
       totaling 256 years.

     <p>Barstow's article, part of a series, "When Workers Die," on how the
     U.S. government deals with the worst cases of death on the job, is
     subtitled "A Culture of Reluctance."  That's an understatement. It
     is a culture of cruel indifference and criminal malfeasance.

     more photographs, a video, and a slide show narrated by David
     Barstow online at <http://www.nytimes.com/national>.

     <h>Which Way To Go, Mr. CEO?
     <p>Let's say you are a top management official at Wal-Mart, Nike, or
     another major American corporation, and you have come to rely on
     workers in the People's Republic of China to make a large part of
     your company's goods and profits. You used to deny that your
     products are made in sweatshops. Now you realize that the on-site
     evidence is undeniable. You face pressure to make your company
     "socially responsible."
     <p>So what to do? You seek guidance from lawyers and other experts. At
     root, however, the choices you face are two, exemplified by the
     opposing approaches carefully delineated by two world figures. Here
     is one approach, capsulized in this quotation:

   <p>"In [a free] economy, there is one and only one social responsibility
   of business -- to use its resources and engage in activities designed
   to increase profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game,
   which is to say, engages in open and free competition, without
   deception or fraud....
   <p>"Few trends could so thoroughly undermine the very foundation of our
   free society as the acceptance by corporate officials of a social
   responsibility other than to make as much money for their stockholders
   as possible." -- Milton Friedman, the distinguished professor of
   economics, writing in his best-selling book "Capitalism and Freedom"
   (page 133, emphasis added).

   <p>I call this the not-to-worry approach. It can be very comforting to
   sweatshop-plagued corporate leaders. It tells them, on the authority
   of a Nobel Prize winner, that in dedicating themselves to making as
   much money as possible for their stockholders they are doing the right
   thing and also fighting to keep our society free.

   <p>Then, there's another approach, capsulized in these three
   propositions:

     <l> "There exist acts which per se and in themselves, independently of
       circumstances, are always seriously wrong" (that is, prohibited
       because they are "always and without exception intrinsically evil"
       [emphasis in original]).
     <l> Among such evils are "degrading conditions of work which treat
       laborers as mere instruments of profit."
     <l> "So long as [such evils] infect human civilization they
       contaminate those who inflict them more than those who suffer
       them" -- Pope John Paul II in his encyclical letter Veritatis
       Splendor (para. 80).

     <p>I call this the you'd better worry approach. It prohibits treating
     workers as mere instruments of profit. Morally, it places a severe
     limitation on you even if the existing rules of the game do not.
     <p>It's your choice, Mr. CEO.  Which approach will you take?
                      _________________________________

     <h>Global Norms Put Heat on Business
     <p>The United Nations Commission on Human Rights will soon consider
     adopting a set of "Norms on the Responsibilities of Transnational
     Corporations" covering environmental, labor, and human rights
     standards. The U.S. Council for International Business, very much
     in character, is vigorously opposing them.
     <p>The proposed norms, which will be on the agenda of the Human Rights
     Commission's annual meeting in March, were adopted by a subsidiary
     unit of the Commission in August, and since then they have provoked
     sharp controversy between its proponents and business
     representatives, often in the pages of the Financial Times.
     <p>In a letter published in that London-based newspaper on December
     17, Thomas M.T. Niles, president of the U.S. Council, objected to
     the norms because, if approved, they would "create a new
     international legal framework, cutting across virtually every area
     of business operations, with companies, rather than the governments
     that negotiated them, responsible for implementing international
     treaties and conventions." Besides, the norms are unnecessary
     because "most companies are already [taking human rights
     seriously]."
     <p>In a response published December 19, also in the Financial Times,
     Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland, former UN High
     Commissioner for Human Rights, and now executive director of the
     Ethical Globalization Initiative, wrote:

   <p>"Mr. Niles is right to say that many companies are committed to
   respecting human rights....But Mr. Niles goes too far in suggesting
   that this is common practice. The great majority of companies around
   the world have not thought carefully about their responsibilities in
   relation to human rights.
   <p>"A recent survey by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
   Development found that only one in five has adopted codes of conduct
   or shares compliance information with the public. Few companies even
   mention human rights in their codes of conduct.  Far fewer...employ
   third-party reporting systems. In more extreme cases, companies are
   directly responsible for, and complicit in, violations of rights, as
   recent expert reports of the UN Security Council on the Illegal
   Exploitation of Natural Resources and Other Sources of Wealth of the
   Democratic Republic of the Congo clearly show."

     <p>Breaking ranks from business opposition, seven companies, including
     ABB, Novartis, and Barclays, have publicly stated their intentions
     to "give serious consideration to the role these norms might play
     in their own work," according to the new Business Leaders'
     Initiative on Human Rights. Mrs. Robinson, who chairs that group,
     expressed confidence that there would be "a steady increase in the
     number of companies that look seriously at international human
     rights standards when making decisions about their operating
     methods, personnel policies, procurement, and investment
     decisions."
     <p>Is that optimism justified?  It depends on many factors, including
     (but not only) the position of the U.S. government, which is one of
     53 government members of the UN Human Rights Commission.  The Bush
     administration is hardly an advocate of expanding international
     obligations in the area of human rights, labor, and the
     environment, and relies heavily on the views of organizations like
     the U.S. Council for International Business.
     <h>Counseling the Council on Why To Take the High Ground
     <p>The U.S. Council has not sought my advice, but here it is anyway:
     <l> The norms draft does indeed contain a very broad set of
       (non-binding) obligations, mostly reflecting and clarifying
       standards that already exist in many international treaties and
       conventions. But it is only a draft, and subject to revision.
       Instead of battling to bury the norms and all they represent, you
       would be wise to use the Council's influence to make the norms
       workable and to render them conducive to promoting corporate
       social responsibility.
     <l> The bad apples, which you know exist, spoil the reputation of all
       business. Worse, they spoil the business environment by inclining
       others to follow their example. All too often, this corrupting
       process goes on under a polite name: meeting the competition.
     <l> Governments actively protect the rights and interests of business
       not only through domestic legislation but more and more through a
       network of international law and intergovernmental organizations.
       But there is a huge void in international safeguards that protect
       the rights and interests of labor. As global integration
       intensifies, and global communications increase, that void becomes
       more and more difficult to ignore, and more and more difficult to
       justify.
     <l> Don't underestimate Mrs. Mary Robinson and the power of the idea
       she is promoting. Business' heavy dependence on the protection of
       international law and intergovernmental organizations while
       vigorously opposing those benefits to others is increasingly being
       recognized as selfish, unbalanced, unfair, and untenable.
     <l> Some businesses agree that they have the opportunity to do much
       more to advance human rights, and in many other businesses there
       are executives who understand this opportunity and would like to
       seize it. You ought to join them instead of fighting them.

     <p>(Unfortunately, the Website of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights
     and the unit that approved the norms, its Subcommission on the
     Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, is not user-friendly. The
     subcommission member who is most responsible for drafting the
     norms, and whose eight years on the subcommission end in March,
     David S. Weissbrodt, professor of law at the University of
     Minnesota, has made the draft norms available on the university
     Website. For background information, see the Website of the
     Business and Human Rights Resource Centre and the current Human
     Rights Brief published by the Washington College of Law.)

     <h>Diary: So Far, No Dumb Mistakes
     <p>Breakfast finished, Mai, who will be three at the end of February,
     was wiggling to leave her highchair. "Hold on," my wife said. "I'll
     unplug you."
     <p>"No, Grandma," Mai insisted. "Unbuckle me. Unbuckle, please."
     <p>At her present pace, in a few short years Mai should be ready to
     copyread each edition of Human Rights for Workers before I publish
     it on the Web. I live in muted dread that I'll go final with a text
     that has some dumb mistakes. I make use of two kinds of spell
     checkers, and they catch most of my typos. Careful reading, and
     rereading, catches others, the ones that the mechanical systems
     miss.
     <p>But spell checkers are blind to factual errors. Like the one I made
     the other day in the annual Christmas letter I wrote early in
     December. In describing the family Christmas eve that we would
     celebrate at our son's house in nearby Ashburn, Virginia, I located
     it "close to where Lee crossed the Potomac, only to get beaten at
     Gettysburg."  After most of the letters were in the mail, I got an
     uneasy feeling about that sentence. I decided to check a map. Of
     course, Lee's army was actually defeated at Antietam, after
     crossing the Potomac much farther upriver than I had said.
     Embarrassing errors, which would be far more embarrassing if they
     had gone out over the Web.
     <p>I launched Human Rights for Workers in February 1996. During those
     eight years, an occasional typo or punctuation error has slipped
     through, but (to my knowledge) no really dumb mistake of substance.
     I'll try to continue that record in the next eight years. But the
     sooner I get Mai's help the better.

     <p>My wife Dzung edits a Vietnamese literary magazine, Co Thom, which,
     loosely translated into English, means "fragrant grass," a poetic
     Vietnamese expression symbolizing the cultural basis of the
     quarterly publication.  Co Thom promotes Vietnamese literary,
     artistic, and human values, and has been doing so for eight years
     now, thanks to volunteer help and donations from
     Vietnamese-Americans who want to keep the Vietnamese language alive
     among the many Vietnamese who fled their native land to escape
     Communism.
     <p>After serving as the magazine's editor for three years, Dzung has
     just been named its publisher too, which among other things means
     promoting subscriptions ($30 a year).  If you read Vietnamese, and
     want to subscribe (as you really should), send me an email, and
     I'll pass it on to my dear colleague.
