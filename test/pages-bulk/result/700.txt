<h>Quake maps show shaky East Bay soil
<h>Risk of 'liquefaction' in north Alameda County

   <p>The seismic time bomb ticking under the Bay Area could wreak
   especially widespread damage in heavily populated parts of the East
   Bay, according to new earthquake-hazard maps announced Thursday.

   <p>Broad expanses of northern Alameda County's flatlands fall into a
   "liquefaction" risk zone, meaning the soil could shake like a bowl of
   jelly in a major quake. It's the same phenomenon that struck the San
   Francisco Marina in the 1989 Loma Prieta quake.

   vThe new maps also show the hills thickly mottled with patches of
   potential landslide areas. The color charts were issued under state
   law requiring property sellers to disclose potential liquefaction or
   landslide risk. The law also requires geologic studies for new
   construction.

   <p>"Just because you live in one of these zones, it doesn't mean the end
   of the world," said Darryl Young, director of the state Department of
   Conservation, which presented the maps at a news conference in
   Berkeley.

   <p>"It's just a wake-up call," he said. "This is about reducing fear and
   giving people constructive things they can do. . . . Unless you know
   where you live and how the ground likely will perform, you can't start
   to prepare for a quake."

   <p>The maps show only whether a property lies within a liquefaction or
   landslide zone. They don't show relative risk within the zones. The
   risk within a zone varies considerably, depending on the type of soil,
   subsurface water and terrain.

   <p>In Berkeley, which Young praised as a leader in earthquake
   preparedness, about 40 percent of the city lies within the two zones,
   estimated city mapping analyst Brian Quinn. Much of Oakland and San
   Leandro also are included, and all of Alameda and Emeryville fall into
   the liquefaction areas.

   <p>The zones are being created throughout the state under a 1990 law
   passed after Loma Prieta.

   <p>Any person selling a property within the zones must disclose it, just
   as they do the property's presence in a flood plain. New commercial
   buildings occupied by humans and new residential projects of at least
   fou	r units in the zones must conduct a geologic survey to obtain a
   building permit. Whether single-family homes, duplexes or triplexes
   will need to do such studies is left up to the local city or county.

   <p>The law takes effect whenever the map for that area is officially
   certified.

   <p>San Francisco's was adopted in 2000. Alameda County's was approved
   Feb. 14, though state officials didn't stage their public debut until
   Thursday.

   <p>Young and other officials sought both to ring an alarm about the Bay
   Area's seismic danger and to offer help on how to be prepared.

   <p>"We know that in the next 30 years, there is a greater than 70 percent
   chance of a major earthquake," he said. "The Loma Prieta quake was not
   the big one. The Loma Prieta quake was in Santa Cruz County 50 miles
   away."

   <p>He urged citizens to consult the new maps to find out if their
   property lies in one of the zones by downloading them from the
   department Web site at gmw.consrv.ca.gov/shmp/. They can be purchased
   in black and white -- call (415) 495-8700 -- or in color -- call (415)
   904-7707 or (916) 445-5716 -- or viewed at the department's San
   Francisco office at 185 Berry St., Suite 210.

   <p>If citizens find their property in a potential risk zone, they should
   consult their insurance agent, a local builder or their city for
   advice, he said. Solutions can be as simple as securing heavy objects
   or as relatively inexpensive as bolting a house to its foundation.

   <p>For those wanting detailed information on the risk within the zones,
   the Association of Bay Area Governments and United States Geological
   Survey have several maps showing comparative risks for liquefaction,
   landslides and ground-shaking.

   <p>For example, ABAG's interactive "Liquefaction Susceptibility" map can
   be accessed at gis.abag.ca.gov/website/liq/viewer.htm. The USGS
   liquefaction map for northern Alameda County is at
   quake.wr.usgs.gov/prepare/alameda.html.
