       <h>CoCoFiRe (Collaborative and Content Based Filtering and Retrieval

   <p>The CoCoFiRe group is currently under formation, bringing together
   researchers in the HUMLE lab with similar interests and related
   projects. Three such on-going projects are Kalas, RIND, and CoPIR.

   <p>The Kalas project investigates the e ects of social navigation in a
   real world scenario: a recipe recom- mender system. Currently, a
   public beta release of the system is under study. The principal
   researcher in Kalas is Martin Svensson.

   <p>RIND, Recommendations and Adaptation of content in New Domains,
   investigates how a con guration system can be enhanced with
   recommendations and adaptive user interfaces, to support the user when
   con guring a complex product. RIND is a 6 months project funded by
   Vinnova, and ends in December 2001. Principal researchers are Asa
   Rudstrýom, Rickard Cöster and Tomas Olsson.

   <p>CoPIR (Collaborative Information Seeking and Retrieval)addresses the
   problem of supporting workgroup interaction and collaboration in
   professional information seeking and retrieval. The project ends in
   December 2001 and is nanced by Vinnova. Principal investigator is
   Preben Hansen.

                                     <h>KALAS

   <p>The Kalas project investigates the effects of social navigation in a
   real world scenario. Based on work done in the PERSONA project the
   Kalas project focuses on the domain of choosing interesting recipes
   based on social navigation. In the spring of 2001 we will conduct a
   large-scale study of a recipe recommender system (Kalas), spanning
   over two months with approximately 1000 users.

<h>Motivation

   <p>In a typical online grocery store, there will be 10.000 different
   products to choose from. Navigating such a space is not only
   time-consuming but can also be boring and tedious. Some users will
   have more difficulties than others to efficiently make use of the
   existing online stores. In a study on an existing hypertext based
   online store, it was show that elderly users spent in average twice as
   much time finding items on a shopping list than did younger users. In
   both age categories, users sometimes completely gave up when searching
   for certain items.

   <p>It has been shown that on-line food shoppers do not gain any time from
   shopping food online, instead they appreciate flexibility in time and
   space. Shoppers feel that they can avoid the tedious, boring, food
   stores, but they loose the sensuous pleasures of seeing, touching and
   smelling the products. This is somewhat compensated by getting status
   among friends from being able to tell stories about how they shop food
   online. In a study by Richmond on shopping in a virtual reality
   environment, it was found that users also want to be able to access
   the social aspects of a physical store, they want to socialise with
   other people.

   <p>Given the problems with navigation and the lack of social interaction
   and sensuous pleasures in the existing online grocery stores, the
   domain should be an excellent application example for social
   navigation techniques.

<h>Research Questions

   <p>There are several issues that we want to address in our study. We know
   that social navigation works, but what is it exactly that people gain
   by using social navigation enhanced systems. The following effects
   seems crucial and it is these that we aim to invesigate:

   <p>Filtering: A couple of user studies show that history-enriched
   environments and recommender systems might help filter out the most
   relevant information from a large information space.

   <p>Quality: Sometimes it is not enough that the information obtained is
   relevant, it must also possess qualities that can only be determined
   from how other users reacts to it (the social texture discussed in the
   introduction). Only when an expert verifies that a piece of
   information is valid, or when a piece of art is often referred to in
   the literature, will it be of high quality in the eyes of a navigator.

   <p>Social affordance: Visible actions of other users can inform us what
   is appropriate behaviour, what can or cannot be done. At the same
   time, this awareness of others and their actions makes us feel that
   the space is alive and might make it more inviting. Here the focus is
   not on whether users navigate more efficiently, or find exactly what
   they need more quickly; instead, the intent is to make them stay
   longer in the space, feel more relaxed, and perhaps be inspired to try
   out new functionality,to pick up new products and new information
   items, or to try out new servicesthat they would not have considered
   otherwise. Users can quickly pick up on the"norms" for how to behave
   when they see others behaviours.

   <p>Usage reshapes functionality and structure: Social navigation design
   may alter the organisation of the space. In amazon.com, the structure
   of the space experienced by visitors is changed: one can follow the
   recommendations instead of navigating by the search-for-terms
   structure. Social navigation thus could be a first step towards
   empowering users to, in a natural subtle way, make the functionality
   and structure "drift" and make our information spaces more "fluid"Of
   course, social navigation comes with a price. The major drawbacks with
   social navigation are related to the fact that users has to be visible
   and that it (in many situations) relies on a large user population:

   <p>Privacy: Since social navigation relies on the visibilityof people and
   their actions, people have to give up some of their privacy. In what
   circumstances are people willing to do this and to what extent? There
   is also indications of that the importance of privacy is highly
   individual. Some users are willing to share almost anything about
   themselves, whilst others want to be totally invisible.

   <p>Bootstrapping: Since social navigation systems often rely onthe
   accumulated users behaviour, such as, trails of where people have gone
   andrecommender systems, they will work poorly when little information
   has beencollected. Is it possible to find techniques that somewhat
   overcome thisproblem by, for instance, using other strategies to
   recommend in an early stageof the systems lifecycle?

   <p>Snowball effects: At the other end of the bootstrapping problemwe face
   another problem. When more and more people walks down the "wrong" path
   this will be indicated as a "good" path in a typical social navigation
   system. To what extent is it possible to detect and deal with these
   wrong paths?

   <p>Concept drift: Over time people and information change. Whatwas
   interesting to me yesterday may be totally irrelevant today.
   Recommendersystems tend to get "conservative" in the sense that once
   they have a userprofile it is very difficult to change it. In order
   for social navigation to bereally successful it has to take into
   consideration that peoples' interestschange and that different types
   of information have different expirationdates.
