   <h>Lay of the Land

   <h>Elemental Dreaming

   <h>Why do the coal and nuclear industries love hydrogen?

   <p>All of a sudden, hydrogen is the hottest atom on the periodic table.
   When compressed into fuel cells, the element works like a battery that
   can power everything from cars to spaceships, while producing no
   waste--just drinkable water. Alternative-energy guru Amory Lovins is a
   fan, as is National Mining Association president Jack Gerard. Other
   enthusiasts are politicians looking to establish green credentials
   without irritating the automotive and energy lobbies.

   <p>First on the bandwagon was President George W. Bush, who announced
   last year that his administration is investing $1.7 billion over five
   years to develop hydrogen fuel-cell technology for automobiles. Then
   California's newly elected governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, vowed to
   sign an executive order requiring hydrogen fueling stations every 20
   miles on the state's highways. Schwarzenegger, who popularized the
   gas-guzzling military Humvee as a trophy car for civilians, has said
   he will convert one of his five Hummers to run on hydrogen, a $35,000
   upgrade.

   <p>Schwarzenegger's hydrogen fueling stations would cost up to half a
   million dollars each, which seems a bit pricey when you consider that
   his converted Hummer will be about the only vehicle using them. There
   are no hydrogen-powered cars in the showrooms now, and Bush's
   fuel-cell program doesn't give auto manufacturers any deadlines for
   producing one. The few prototypes on the road cost several million
   dollars, and a recent report from the National Academy of Sciences
   said that fuel-cell cars are still decades away.

   <p>There's also the small matter of producing the hydrogen, which doesn't
   occur in its pure form on Earth. One option is to split hydrogen from
   water using electricity, but unless the electricity comes from a
   renewable source like wind or solar, this method could end up
   increasing greenhouse-gas emissions. The Bush administration, ever
   eager to prop up the coal, oil, and nuclear industries, advocates
   extracting hydrogen from fossil fuels and splitting it from water
   using nuclear power. Daniel Becker, director of the Sierra Club's
   Global Warming and Energy Program, characterizes this approach as "a
   nicotine patch that causes cancer."

   <p>The Department of Energy estimates that Bush's hydrogen fuel-cell
   initiatives could reduce demand for petroleum by 11 million barrels
   per day by 2040. But making gas-powered cars even slightly more
   efficient would achieve huge savings a whole lot sooner. If U.S. cars
   averaged a very achievable 40 miles a gallon, we could cut oil
   consumption by 4 million barrels per day right now--nearly as much as
   the United States imports from OPEC. --Dashka Slater
   
   <h>Climate Reality Check

   <p>While the Bush administration stays in its bubble of denial with
   regard to climate change, a British think tank has proposed a pinprick
   of reality: trade sanctions.

   <p>The European Union ratified the Kyoto Protocol on global warming in
   2002, and estimates are that it will have to raise energy prices by as
   much as 60 to 70 percent in order to comply. The London-based New
   Economics Foundation argues that because the United States won't be
   faced with similar costs, U.S. businesses enjoy an unfair competitive
   advantage. To level the economic playing field, the foundation
   suggests slapping a duty on imports from nations that refuse to ratify
   the protocol. Such "remedial trade restrictions" have been allowed by
   the World Trade Organization before, and might just make willful
   disregard for our warming world too hot to handle.

   <h>Peace Along a Polluted Waterway

      <p>Rivers commonly serve as political divides, but in the Middle East,
   where armed conflict is a fact of life, environmental concerns over a
   beleaguered stream have brought people together. Since the mid-1990s,
   Israeli and Palestinian scientists have been working together to clean
   up the Alexander River, which carries sewage from two Palestinian
   towns into Israel's coastal plain north of Tel Aviv and on to the
   Mediterranean. They constructed a sewage-treatment facility, created
   parks, and prepared "basking areas" for the river's Nile soft-shell
   turtles, which can weigh more than 150 pounds.

   <p>The neighbors continue to cooperate, but the key is keeping the issues
   local. When Israelis and Palestinians meet to discuss river
   rehabilitation, they agree to discuss "only sewage," says Amos
   Brandeis, manager of the Alexander River Project. "No politics and no
   journalists are allowed."
   <p>--Eric Pallant
   

   <h>Bold Strokes
   
   <h>Wall Street's Good Investment
   <p>When the Washington-based timber company Trillium ran up a $30 million
   bill it couldn't repay with the investment firm Goldman Sachs, it
   settled the debt by forking over landholdings in Tierra del Fuego,
   Chile. But what's a Wall Street firm gonna do with 680,000 acres
   containing rare, old-growth forest? Instead of making a buck, the
   company opted to work with U.S. and Chilean environmental
   organizations to create a nature preserve. This good news follows
   another victory for Chilean conservationists: Last December, the
   government agreed to create a 740,000-acre nature sanctuary from land
   donated by Doug Tompkins, the founder of clothing-maker Esprit. 

   <h>You're Busted
   <p>In the popular television series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,
   beautiful police people collect bloody evidence, peer knowingly
   through microscopes, and solve murders in less than an hour. Based on
   the real-world work of medical forensics, the show has been credited
   with an uptick in science-course enrollments at colleges across the
   country. But at the University of Wales, Bangor, one professor is
   bringing that science even more down to earth, offering the world's
   first degree in environmental forensics.

   <p>As with humans, chemicals have unique "fingerprints" that can be used
   for identification purposes. ("You say this groundwater contamination
   isn't from your oil refinery? Let's just check the fingerprint.") The
   Bangor students learn how to trace the sources and effects of oil,
   sewage, and toxics contamination, while also learning the fine art of
   expert-witness court testimony.

   <p>The field of environmental forensics began in the United States in the
   late 1990s, but to date there are no degree-offerings, though schools
   like Oregon State University have a Department of Environmental and
   Molecular Toxicology that teaches similar skills. --Marilyn Berlin

   <h>Hybrids Rev Up

   <p>Motor Trend magazine's 2004 Car of the Year is so much in demand that
   you may have to wait up to four months if you want to own one. But
   this coveted vehicle isn't a hot new roadster. It's the Toyota Prius,
   a gas-electric hybrid whose raciest spec is that it gets 60 miles per
   gallon in city driving. Interest is so high that Toyota is increasing
   Prius production by 25 percent, and is scurrying to introduce
   additional hybrid models, including a luxury Lexus.

   <p>Toyota's competitors have taken notice. Honda will introduce a hybrid
   version of its top-selling midsize Accord this fall, complementing its
   gas-electric Civic sedan and two-seater Insight models. Next year,
   Ford will offer a gas-electric version of its compact Escape
   sport-utility vehicle, which is expected to get up to 40 mpg.
   "Fuel-efficient hybrid gasoline-electric cars and trucks are pulling
   out of the Sierra Club parking lot and into a driveway near you,"
   writes the Detroit Free Press.

   <p>While the hybrid race heats up, heavyweight General Motors pokes along
   in the slow lane. It recently shelved plans to introduce two hybrid
   compact SUVs. Instead, GM will put its efforts into a "mild" hybrid
   system that only increases fuel economy by 10 to 13 percent. And
   Subaru is one automaker that seems to be driving the wrong way. Long a
   preferred choice of outdoorsy auto buyers who want all-wheel drive but
   not inefficient SUVs, Subaru recently announced that its popular
   Outback models would gain an inch or so in height, thereby qualifying
   as "light trucks." The switch allows the company to take advantage of
   a loophole in federal fuel-economy standards that lets trucks enjoy a
   lower mpg standard than cars. But if Subaru's customers stay away, the
   company may rue the day it threw its Outbacks into reverse.--Reed

   <h>Posterior Protection Agency

   <p>More than three years into the administration of George W. Bush, the
   Environmental Protection Agency has been thoroughly politicized.
   Budgets are being slashed, scientific findings are being suppressed,
   enforcement actions are down by 40 percent, and employees fear that
   doing their jobs will put them at odds with the agency's political
   leadership. Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, an
   organization that "protects the government employees who protect our
   environment," recently polled EPA staffers. (Details are available at
   www.peer.org under "Employee Surveys.") Here are some of its findings:

     <l>More than three out of four say that politics shape EPA actions
   "more than they did five years ago."

     <l>More than half agree that "promoting the president's energy plan and
   other administration initiatives has become more important" than
   protecting the environment.

     <l>Nearly one-third say they are "hesitant to perform controversial
   aspects of [their] job for fear of retaliation." (Among managers and
   supervisors, the figure jumps to 42 percent.)

   <p>A separate PEER survey of EPA criminal-enforcement staff found similar
   disillusionment:

     <l>More than two of three believe "the emphasis that the EPA places on
   investigating serious environmental crime has declined."

     <l>Nearly three of four note a "decrease in resources available to
   investigate environmental crime during the past two years."

     <l>More than half "fear job retaliation for reporting improper
   activity."

     <l>Fewer than one in seven believes that the "EPA's criminal program is
   stronger today than it was during the Clinton administration."

     <l>When asked how the agency's criminal-enforcement program might be
   improved, one respondent answered simply: "Concentrate on the `E' in
   EPA." 

   
   <h>Equal-Opportunity Poison

   <h>Lax mercury rules threaten rich as well as poor

   <p>Many environmental hazards seem perversely aimed at the poor. People
   in older houses with peeling paint are susceptible to lead poisoning;
   subsistence fishers pull PCB-laden fish out of industrial waterways.
   But a recent study in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives
   shows that middle- and upper-income women who eat large amounts of
   tuna and swordfish steaks are contaminated with mercury at rates up to
   ten times that of the population at large.

   <p>It's not only ahi-eating Atkins dieters who are at risk, though.
   Another new study, this one by the EPA, shows that one in every six
   women of childbearing age--twice as many as previously thought--now
   has potentially harmful amounts of mercury in her bloodstream, and
   that 630,000 children are born each year with blood mercury above the
   EPA's safe level. A potent neurotoxin that is especially hazardous to
   developing fetuses and young children, mercury can impair intelligence
   and learning ability, and even lead to permanent brain damage.

   <p>How is such widespread poisoning taking place? No one knows for sure,
   but a likely culprit is canned tuna, the most widely eaten fish in the
   United States. (Children consume twice as much canned tuna as any
   other fish.) The U.S. Food and Drug Administration rarely tests canned
   tuna at all, but nongovernmental groups have found shockingly high
   mercury levels, particularly in albacore, aka "white" tuna. A 44-pound
   child eating one six-ounce can of albacore per week would exceed the
   EPA's safety standard by four times; a 132-pound woman by one and a
   half times. This March, the EPA and the FDA issued a strict new
   advisory, warning pregnant women, nursing mothers, women who may
   become pregnant, and young children not to eat shark, swordfish, king
   mackerel, or tilefish at all; to limit albacore to one meal per week;
   and closely watch local advisories about wild-caught fish.

   <p>Simultaneously, however, the EPA was facilitating the continued
   dumping of large amounts of mercury into the atmosphere from
   coal-fired power plants. Until recently, these plants were expected to
   reduce their emissions by 90 percent within three years. But last
   December, at the power industry's urging, the EPA proposed instead
   establishing a system of pollution permits that could be bought and
   sold between companies, but would take six years to achieve a 30
   percent reduction. EPA staffers complained that they were told not to
   perform the usual scientific and economic analysis of the new
   proposal, portions of which were identical to recommendations from a
   utility-industry lobbying firm. According to the Washington Post, "At
   least a dozen paragraphs were lifted, sometimes verbatim, from . . .
   industry suggestions." --Paul Rauber

   <h>Fish Eater's Guide

   <p>Choosing what to fix for a fish fry is more complicated than it used
   to be, but there are plenty of resources to help you make a
   responsible, safe choice. First the big picture: Is the fish
   overharvested and endangered? To find out, see "Food for Thought"
   (January/February), or download the Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood
   Watch Card at www.mbayaq.org/cr/seafoodwatch.asp.

   <p>Next, is the fish safe to eat? Mercury is by far the most widespread
   seafood contaminant. Tilefish, swordfish, shark, albacore, and king
   mackerel all tend to be high in mercury. Lower-risk species include
   tilapia, wild Pacific salmon, sole, catfish, and clams. The Sea Turtle
   Restoration Project's Web site allows you to calculate, based on
   serving size and your weight, the safety of any of 50 fish varieties
   that have been tested by the FDA: www.seaturtles.org/gotmercury.htm.

   <p>Fish can also be contaminated by pesticides and other pollutants (see
   "Updates," above right). Environmental Defense has combined
   information from various consumption advisories into its "Seafood
   Selector": see www.environmentaldefense.org/tool.cfm?tool=seafood.
  

   <h>Ideological Alamo

   <h>A censored textbook sparks a free-speech lawsuit

   <p>Dr. Daniel Chiras never thought that writing textbooks would get him
   branded a traitor. But that's what happened when the
   Republican-controlled Texas State Board of Education decided that the
   latest version of his popular environmental-science text was
   inappropriate for the state's public schools. Objecting to passages
   that noted the United States' disproportionate production of
   greenhouse gases and raised questions about the biblical mandate to
   have dominion over nature, the board rejected Chiras's book in 2001,
   labeling it "anti-American" and "anti-Christian." Chiras sued last
   fall, calling the decision unconstitutional.

   <p>With more than 4 million children in public schools and a purchasing
   budget topping $500 million, Texas buys more textbooks than any state
   except California--so the board's decision could affect authors,
   publishers, and students nationwide. "The First Amendment protects
   school textbooks from being rejected on the basis of points of view,
   but that's just what the board has done," says attorney Adele Kimmel,
   who represents Chiras and two Texas students in their lawsuit. "This
   is blatant censorship."

   <p>Noting that previous editions of his book Environmental Science:
   Creating a Sustainable Future have been a teaching staple for years,
   Chiras maintains he was targeted by right-wing critics. The suit's
   defendants, including former board chair Grace Shore, the co-owner of
   a small gas and oil company, declined to be interviewed, although
   David Bradley, a Galveston-area board member, did tell his hometown
   Daily News the free-speech suit was "silly and frivolous."

   <p>Textbooks that the board did approve went through extensive,
   last-minute revisions to soften language out of step with conservative
   ideals. In a section about climate change, one publisher even added
   the line, "Does it really matter if the world gets warmer?" --Dan Oko
   

   <h>Updates

   <p>WHEN FISH ARE FOUL A new study showing that fish raised on farms
   contain far more carcinogens and other contaminants than the wild kind
   may spur you to change your diet. According to the study, published in
   the journal Science in January, we should eat no more than one serving
   of farmed salmon per month to avoid exposure to more than a dozen
   pollutants, including dioxins and PCBs. This fall, seafood sold in
   U.S. markets will carry labels stating where it was caught, where it
   was processed, and whether it is wild or farmed. (See "Food for
   Thought," January/February.)

   <p>RIVERS ADRIFT Last spring, a federal judge gave the Bush
   administration a year to revise its blueprint for restoring endangered
   Columbia and Snake River salmon. But federal policies continue to
   permit the region's dams to violate the Clean Water Act, allowing the
   rivers to get lethally warm--and harming wild salmon runs.
   Environmentalists, tribes, fishermen, and biologists advocate removing
   four Snake River dams to recover Northwest salmon. (See "Lay of the
   Land," September/October 2003.) To demand effective salmon-recovery
   efforts, send a letter to the Bush administration at
   www.sierraclub.org/lewisandclark/alerts/salmon2.asp.

   <p>CLEARING THE SMOKE In December, a federal appeals court forced the
   Bush administration to delay by at least a year its industry-friendly
   changes to "new source review" rules for emissions from aging power
   plants. Existing law prevents utilities and other industries from
   making plant upgrades without also installing new pollution-control
   equipment. (See "Lay of the Land," November/December 2003.)

   <p>MOST BANG FOR THE BUCK U.S. Forest Service studies have concluded that
   taxpayers save money when government jobs are not farmed out to
   private firms. Of 167 reviews completed by mid-October 2003, only 12
   found jobs that could be done more efficiently by outside contractors.

   <h>Biotech Fails the Test

   <h>New studies show increased pesticide use, harm to biodiversity

   <p>In March, residents of rural Mendocino County, California, voted to
   ban genetically modified plants and animals from being grown or raised
   within county lines. The law is the first of its kind in the United
   States, but likely not the last, as recent studies confirm some of
   environmentalists' worst fears about tinkering with nature.

   <p>Last November, agricultural economist Dr. Charles Benbrook published
   the first long-term study of pesticide use on corn, soybeans, and
   cotton genetically engineered to tolerate herbicides or to produce
   their own insecticides. Relying on data from the U.S. Department of
   Agriculture, he found that pesticide application indeed declined
   during the first three years of commercial use--just as industry
   claimed it would. But in the last three years of the eight-year study
   period, pesticide use on genetically modified soybeans, the most
   common bioengineered crop, skyrocketed. Biotech cotton and corn
   registered small increases as well. Overall, pesticide use rose by 50
   million pounds.

   <p>The change, Benbrook says, is no surprise. "Scientists have warned
   that heavy reliance on [herbicide-tolerant] crops might lead to
   changes in weed communities and resistance, in turn triggering the
   need to apply additional herbicides and/or increase rates of
   application," he writes in the study. "These predictable ecological
   adaptations have now been documented."

   <p>Perhaps equally predictable is the toll that increased herbicide use
   takes on ecosystems. Also last fall, scientists in Great Britain
   reported their findings from a government-funded study comparing
   biodiversity in fields growing conventional sugar beet, oilseed rape,
   and maize with those growing plants genetically modified for
   resistance to herbicides. With the beet and rape plants, the
   researchers found fewer seeds, flowering weeds, and insects--all
   important food sources for birds and other wildlife--in the
   bioengineered fields.

   <p>No genetically modified crops are currently commercially grown in the
   UK; the research was commissioned to help the government decide
   whether or not to introduce them. In the United States, the biotech
   genie is already out of the bottle. But these studies might inspire
   more counties to stuff him back in. --Jennifer Hattam
