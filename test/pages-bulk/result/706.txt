<h>SIT's 40th Anniversary Conference:
<h>Knowledge from Practice and Fieldwork

   <p>Friday, May 27, 2005
   <p>School for International Training (SIT)
   <p>Brattleboro, VT

   <p>The vision expressed by SIT founder and president emeritus Dr. John A.
   (Jack) Wallace is today realized more than ever in education and
   training programs designed to build a global citizenry capable of
   effecting positive change. Indeed, SIT is now internationally
   recognized for its focus on practical skills, intercultural awareness
   and ethical attitudes for professionals, students and other citizens
   engaged in cross-cultural and international action/learning. Equally
   important is the substantive and unique body of knowledge generated by
   SIT alumni and others engaged in its programs.

   <p>Next spring, SIT will cap the year-long celebration of its 40th
   anniversary year by bringing together the experiences of alumni,
   faculty, staff and close colleagues in a groundbreaking conference
   focused on the knowledge generated through four decades of practice
   and fieldwork. Using the experiential learning cycle that continues to
   inform nearly every SIT program, the one-day conference will provide a
   forum for presenters and participants to reflect on experiences in
   various roles and professions, to generalize and synthesize new
   knowledge, and to share this knowledge with others in the process
   showcasing the unique and evolving ways SIT has made significant
   contributions to a more socially just, sustainable and peaceful world.

   <p>Lessons learned during the Conference will be shared via electronic
   and/or print media, will become part of SIT's history, and will serve
   to enhance the institution's ability to fulfill its mission as we go
   forward.
