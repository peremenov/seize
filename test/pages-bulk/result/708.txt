   <h>Household technology and textiles

   <h>Choosing electrical appliances

   <p>The following factors need to be considered when choosing electrical
   appliances:
     <l> Buy the best you can afford. Establish this by comparing prices in
       several outlets.
     <l> Buy from a reliable dealer, preferably one who has been in
       business several years.
     <l> Buy a brand that you are familiar with (or someone else has
       recommended to you).
     <l> Check for quality marks, i.e., BEAB (British Electrical Approvals
       Board).
     <l> Ensure the appliance is big enough to suit your individual and
       family needs.
     <l> Check that the appliance has a guarantee and even an after-sales
       service.
     <l> Compare several different appliances and consult 'Consumer Choice'
       magazine for an unbiased report on the appliance.
     <l> The appliance should carry an 'Energy Efficiency' label. This
       should be on top or in front of the model on display in the shop.
       The scale goes from A to G with A being the most energy efficient
       (sometimes up to 55% better than the G rating).
     <l> The appliance should be well-designed, with no sharp edges or
       difficult handles.

   <h>Small Appliances

   <p>Small electrical appliances involve the use of heating elements or a
   small electric motor.

   <p>Element appliances include the following household items:
     <l> Toaster
     <l> Kettle
     <l> Iron
     <l> Electric frying pan
     <l> Deep fat fryer
     <l> Coffee maker

   <h>Working principal of these appliances
   <p>The element is heated by electricity which is attached to the base or
   side of the appliance.

   <p>A thermostat based on a bi-metallic strip bends as it is heated and
   causes the circuit to be broken when it reaches a predetermined
   temperature. As the appliance cools, the bi-metallic strip straightens
   up and makes contact again thereby reconnecting the circuit and the
   appliance is automatically heat controlled.

   <p>Motor appliances include the following household items:
     <l> Food processor
     <l> Mixer
     <l> Liquidizer
     <l> Carving knife

   <h>Working principle of these appliances
   <p>A motor, concealed in the appliance, is driven by electricity.
   <p>Air must be allowed to circulate freely in order to prevent
   overheating.
   <p>Attachments are fitted directly to the motor which drives them.

   <h>Use of small appliances
     <l> Do not handle with wet hands
     <l> Do not allow the element to dry up
     <l> Speed settings should be set for each specific task
     <l> Do not overload the motor
     <l> Follow manufacturers instructions
     <l> Ensure the appliance is set up correctly.

   <h>Care and cleaning
     <l> Do not immerse the appliance in water
     <l> Attachments should be removed and washed separately
     <l> Air vents should be cleaned out regularly
     <l> Hard water causes a build up of limescale on kettle elements. This
       should be removed with vinegar or any commercial product designed
       for the purpose.
     <l> Wipe all appliances with a damp cloth after use and store in a
       cupboard with air circulating freely.

   <h>Large Appliances

   <h>A. Refrigerator
   <h>The working principle of a refrigerator
   <p>Heat is removed from food and the surrounding area, thereby creating
   an environment which retards the activity of microorganisms.
   <p>Temperature is usually about 5°C.
   <p>A refrigerant is used to remove the heat, i.e., a highly sensitive
   liquid which converts easily into a gas and back again into a liquid,
   e.g., freon12 or ammonia.
   <p>The refrigerant is carried in tubes at the back of the appliance and
   around the icebox.

   <p>The electric motor activates the compressor in the appliance which
   forces a gaseous refrigerant in the compressor into the condenser. In
   the condenser the refrigerant changes into a liquid, heat from the
   food in the refrigerator is absorbed by the liquid refrigerant and
   converts it back into a gas, ready for the cycle to begin again. In so
   doing, the food is cooled.
   <p>The refrigerator is thermostatically controlled to ensure an even
   temperature.

   <h>Construction of a refrigerator
   <p>The outer case is made of enameled steel and the lining is made of
   plastic, with layers of insulation between them. The door is
   magnetically sealed.
   <p>The star marking rating is on the icebox and this refers to the
   temperature in the icebox and the length of time pre-frozen food can
   be stored in it.
   <p>*    -6°C  Food stored for one week
   <p>**   -12°C Food stored for one month
   <p>***  -18°C Food stored for three months
   <p>**** -24°C Fresh food can be frozen at this temperature

   <h>Care and cleaning
     <l> Do not open the door too often or put hot food in the refrigerator
     <l> Do not over pack or leave food uncovered
     <l> Defrost regularly if no automatic defrost function exists
     <l> Wash inside with warm water and a little bread soda
     <l> Wash outside with hot soapy water, rinse and dry with dry cloth (a
       little furniture polish can be used on the outside).

   <h>B. Washing machine
   <p>There are many different types of washing machine available, the most
   popular being the fully automatic top or front loader.
   <p>The wash programme can be controlled to suit different fabrics and
   degrees of soiling. A range of programmes exists, from normal wash,
   rinse and spin to soak, economy and half-load.
   <p>The machines are usually plumbed in, i.e., permanently connected to a
   water and electrical supply.

   <h>Working principle of washing machines
   <p>Low foam detergents lower the surface tension of water and allow the
   clothes to become wet. The hydrophobic part of the detergent attaches
   itself to the dirt and the hydrophylic part of the detergent attaches
   itself to the water.
   <p>A motor causes the drum to rotate in half revolutions, causing the
   clothes to be tossed from side to side.
   <p>A thermostat heats the water to a temperature suitable for the fabric
   and the degree of soiling, i.e., 40°C for normal washing and 90°C for
   heavy soiled cotton.
   <p>The soiled water is drained out of the machine through the perforated
   drum and empties into the waste pipe. The drum is filled again with
   cold water and the clothes are rinsed (usually two or three rinses).
   The machine is emptied and begins to revolve at high speed, exerting
   centrifugal force on the contents (the clothes are forced against the
   perforated drum and water is squeezed out of them).

   <h>Construction of a washing machine:
   <p>The outer casing is made of enameled pressed steel. There is a glass
   door with a rubber ring to make it waterproof and a safety lock to
   prevent it being opened when the machine is in operation.
   <p>Inside is a perforated stainless steel drum. A motor rotates the drum
   and a thermostat heats the water. A pump controls the water input and
   output.
   <p>Typically, a washing machine can accommodate three or four kilograms
   of dry clothes and measures 60cm X 60cm X 80cm.

   <h>Care and cleaning
     <l> Sort out the items for washing into whites and coloured items,
       dirty and not so dirty items
     <l> Use the correct detergent and amount as recommended by the
       manufacturer
     <l> Select the appropriate programme according to the care label on
       the clothes
     <l> Check the pockets of clothes for items
     <l> Do not overload the machine
     <l> Clean the filters regularly
     <l> Wash out the soap dispenser regularly
     <l> Leave the door open when not in use
     <l> Clean the outside of machine with hot soapy water. Rinse and dry
       with a dry cloth (a little furniture polish can be used to protect
       the casing).

   <h>Cleaning and the organization of work

   <p>Cleaning within the house can be very tiring but good organisation can
   remove some of the problems associated with this chore.

   <h>Cleaning can be divided into three main areas:
     <l> Jobs which need to be done daily
     <l> Jobs which need to be done weekly
     <l> Jobs which need to be done occasionally.

     <l> Place all the daily jobs in a logical order, e.g., do upstairs
       together and downstairs together
     <l> Try to fit in some weekly jobs each day and occasional jobs can be
       fitted in when time and occasion allow
     <l> Keep equipment where it is needed
     <l> Collect everything that will be needed before starting
     <l> Make full use of all labour-saving appliances
     <l> A good routine involving all members of the family will help to
       keep the home clean and safe.

   <h>Textiles

   <p>Clothing is just one of the uses of textiles in the home. Others
   include bed linen, soft furnishings, towels and tea cloths.

    <p>The desirable properties of textiles are:
   <l> absorbent
   <l> cool
   <l> durable (wears well)
   <l> insulating (keeps in the heat and the cold out)
   <l> resilient (creases fall out easily)
   <l> soft
   <l> stain and water resistant
   <l> mildew resistant
   <l> colour does not bleed
   <l> hard -wearing

    <p>The undesirable properties of textiles are:
   <l> easily creased
   <l> irritates the skin
   <l> becomes bally or pills
   <l> shrinks
   <l> stains easily
   <l> flammable

   <p>A wide variety of care symbols are printed on labels of textile
   articles to assist the consumer in how to care for them. These symbols
   are used on laundry detergents as well.

   <p>Fibres can be divided into two groups.
   <p>A. Natural fibres include:
   <l> Wool -- when wet, it absorbs 30% of its own moisture and needs to be
   dried flat. It needs to be washed gently to avoid shrinkage.
   <l> Silk -- it needs great care when washing as it becomes weak with
   water.
   <l> Cotton -- it can tolerate high temperatures, is strong when wet and
   washes well in the washing machine. It is absorbent and wears very
   well, making it suitable for work wear and soft furnishings.
   <l> Linen -- it is very strong when wet but creases easily.
   
   <p>B. Man-made fibres include:
   <l> Nylon -- it wears well and creases fall out easily. It dries quickly
   but is not absorbent.
   <l> Polyester -- it wears well and creases fall out easily.
   <l> Acrylic -- this fabric washes well and does not shrink. It wears
   well and is very light.

   <p>By law, children's clothes and upholstery fabric must be given a
   flame-retardant finish such as Proban.

   <p>The Fire Safety (Domestic Furniture) Order 1988 regulates the type of
   filling and the textiles to be used in the covering of home
   furnishings. Products must carry two labels, one free-hanging and the
   other permanently attached.
