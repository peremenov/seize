   <p>We believe that our DVD Video Slide Show is the finest offering

   thousands of hours in research and programming to develop a fully
   customizable video slideshow product. In addition, we now offer a PC
   version of the video slideshow with even higher resolution than what's

   <p>You have found the one-stop-shopping-site for converting all of your
   irreplaceable memories to digital format. And, we believe that this
   will be your last stop in your journey to find a high quality
   professional source for your 35mm slide film and 35mm negative film
   scanning needs.
   <p>In addition to our "industry best" slide scanning and film scanning,
   we also provide:
   <p>Video Tape (VHS, VHS-C, Hi8, & 8mm digital tape transfer to DVD), and
   <p>Super8, 8mm, and 16mm movie film transfer to DVD.
   <p>We understand the value of your film and we also know this should be a
   once in a lifetime expenditure. We promise to take care of your film
   as if it was our own treasured memories. And we will do everything in
   our power to ensure that the quality is unsurpassed so that we never
   have an unsatisfied customer. Nobody has more experience in scanning
   slides than we do. We just passed the "4 million slides scanned"
   milepost this year.
   <p>When it comes right down to it -- there are 4 main reasons why you
   should select a particular company to digitize your valuable and
   irreplaceable family memories.
   <l> A reputation for quality and customer satisfaction is number one.
   We pride ourselves in our track record since we started business back
   in 1995. We have always made sure that each and every one of our
   customers are treated with professionalism along with a personal
   touch.
   <l> State of the art equipment is a must and we use nothing but the
   finest scanners available on the market today. All mounted film
   (slides & negatives) is scanned with Nikon Coolscan 5000 ED scanners
   with Digital ICE (infra-red film surface dust and defect elimination
   technology). We use the finest equipment and processes for our film
   transfers to DVD.
   <l> A broad range of options to choose from. We have tried to bring as
   many options as possible to our customers. We have options to fit the
   needs of everyone from professional photographers to the hobbyist, and
   to the family history and genealogy buff.
   <l> And finally -- Cost. We believe that cost should be the final
   decision maker after the other three. Fortunately for you, our costs
   are as low as or in almost every case substantially lower than our
   competitors.
   <p>We convert your slides and negatives into industry standard
   TIFF ( tif ) or JPEG ( jpg ) image files, not proprietary formats such
   as Kodak's PictureCD or PhotoCD. With Kodak's proprietary formats, you
   are limited to the usefulness, ability to copy, and compatibility with
   your software. There has never been a better time for transferring
   <p>slides to DVD.
   <p>This is a great opportunity to pass your precious memories to your
   kids and their kids.
   <p>So take your time -- look around our web site. You'll agree that THESE
   ARE the best values around!

   
   <h>Client comments:
   
   <p>I can't believe what you did, it is so far beyond our expectations!
   What was lost - appears to have been found! I called my wife to see, &
   together we shed nostalgic tears of joy! Thank you so much.
   <p>Dwight H.
   
   <p>I wanted you to know that I am very pleased with the results of your
   work on my very old slides and negatives. Most of these slides were 30
   to 40 years old and the memories are priceless. I now have CD copies
   and have shared these with my family and some friends. You probably
   already know, but let me remind you, that the result of your work can
   make many people very, very happy.
   <p>I was able to give photos of children and their parents (now deceased)
   that those children (now parents themselves) had not seen, and
   certainly did not remember that they even existed. Can't beat that!
   Thanks again.

   <p>I cannot tell you how please I am with the work that you did in
   converting my 35-year-old slides into DVD pictures that look like they
   were taken this week!
   <p>You can be justly proud of how much you are contributing to people's
   lives by helping them keep their memories.
   <p>Sincerely,
   <p>Steven Ogden
  
   <p>Received Disc's and slides in good condition. I reviewed all Discs and
   photos and was very satisfied with the results. I know the slides were
   not in the best of conditions (As they had survived two hurricanes)
   but were very well received on the Disc. Thanks for the good Job.
   <p>Charles Mulligan
   
   <p>I just wanted to thank you for doing such a wonderful job on the
   slides that I had recently sent you. Every picture came out superbly
   and I appreciate your work. I hope to use your services again in the
   future. Thanks again.
   <p>Don Spielvogel
  
   <p>I just received my order and I am totally flabbergasted. I did not
   expect these old slides -- some dating back to 1941 or 1942-- to look
   so good! They are truly remarkable! The colors are so vivid and the
   images so sharp they look like they were taken yesterday with a
   high-end digital camera (or, at least, by someone who's a better
   photographer than I).
   <p>An excellent job! Thank you!
   <p>K. Kennedy
   <p>Glen Rock, New Jersey
   
   <p>I want to thank you for the work you did converting my slides. In
   addition you responded very well to the missing slide transfers in my
   order by regenerating the disk and sending me a free slide show.
   Making an error wasnt nearly as important as how you responded to it
   and the way you corrected it. You have a fine company, good people and
   deliver an excellent product. Your work is an important part of a 5
   generation family pictorial that Im putting together. Thanks again,
   and continued success. You will always have my enthusiastic
   endorsement.

   <p>I wanted to commend you on doing such a superb job on my Dad's very
   old slides (1940's-1950's). I know there were a lot of slides and
   several I am sure had bad mounts, all requiring your attention. I
   suspect the Digital ICE took a lot of time as well. The results speak
   for themselves. Almost as good as new! Your attention to detail in
   maintaining order among those 1,900 image files was excellent! Thank
   you for a job very well done! My ailing 90 year old dad is going to be
   so surprised to see these slides after who knows how many years!!!!
   <p>Thanks!

   <p>I received my slides and CD's yesterday. I am very pleased with the
   results. I will be sure to recommend your service and will add a link
   from my own (family) website
   <p>Thanks for the great service

   <p>I just got my slides and cd's back - AWESOME JOB! My father is going
   to love his Father's Day gift .... THANK YOU VERY MUCH!
   <p>Tina B.
 
   <p>Thank you for my family DVD slideshow. It is a supurb professional
   looking production that my family will enjoy for many years to come.
   The slides are vivid and clear with a great musical background. Again,
   thank you and in return for your great job, I will pass around my
   praise for Larsen Digital Services to all my friends and my co-workers
   at my job.
   <p>Ted Gisburne
  
   <p>Just received the CD's. They look great! I am so pleased that I
   finally did this.

   <p>The scans look great - I'm going to ship them off to Egypt today.
   Thanks for your personalized service - a big plus for us.

   <p>Congratulations to you all. The slides came today, and we are so
   happy. They are beautiful to see on our computer. We haven't been able
   to really look at them since we junked the old projector 20 years ago.
   We're new at this computer stuff and our next move is to learn how to
   make nice prints from your wonderful CD.
   <p>Many thanks, E. Allan Ross
 
   <p>I just had to send you an email to say THANKS!!!!!! The pictures from
   the slides are AWESOME! I had no idea that 40 year old slides could
   turn out such incredible pictures. I'm sure it is totally due to your
   magic touch!
   <p>Thank you very much!
   <p>Stephanie Wilkens

   <p>We were very pleased with the results of our slide scanning to disk.
   Great service great quality. Our grand kids now have a piece of
   history!!!
   <p>Thank you
   <p>G. DeKoster
  
   <p>I just wanted you to know I received my order today and I am
   ecstatic...I didn't think they would come out that good....I think you
   and your crew did a great job.. This will make a wonderful anniversary
   gift for my parents who probably didn't even realize they had these
   old slides anymore...
   thank you again...
   <p>Marjie Becker

   <p>Just wanted to let you know that the slides and CD's arrived in good
   shape yesterday. The images are really great. Many thanks for the
   high-quality results, quick turnaround and your excellent, personal
   service.
   <p>Richard
  
   <p>Thank you so much for the CD's. The slideshow looks absolutely
   amazing and I know my brother and sister are going to think so too.
   The pictures have been in our possession all of our lives so it was
   extremely difficult to put them in the mail. Thanks for taking such
   good care of them!
   <p>Bonnie
 
   <p>What a wonderful job you did converting the slides.
   <p>Thank-you very much!
   <p>Suzanne Fontrier
  
   <p>I received the CDs of my scanned slides today, and I am very happy
   with the results. Some of the slides were over 50 years old but you
   would never know it. Their color and clarity on the CD are amazing.
   Thanks for doing such a great job!!
   <p>Annie M. Egan
   
   <p>Just received my CD of scanned family photos--most dating back to the
   1950s.
   <p>GREAT JOB! Very pleased with the results. What a great way to archive
   these
   valuable old photos.
   <p>Please keep me posted of any specials or updated services.
   <p>Thanks,
   <p>Robert Brookshire
   
   <p>Thank you for a job well done. My slides arrived and the digitized
   images are better than the original slides. Thank you for your prompt
   and accurate service.

   <p>Cave Creek, Arizona

   <p>The work you did was fantastic; everyone that has seen the video has
   been really impressed. We couldn't believe the slides were so clear
   and the music you added brought back many memories. (My husband) was
   also very touched by the song at the end and I liked the way you
   flashed the shots of (My husband) back on the screen.
   <p>People that have seen the video have asked how I found someone like
   you. Isn't strange how there can be a connection between complete
   strangers? I knew you had your heart in this with the first email you
   sent telling me what you were doing with the slides. It was evident
   you put a lot of thought and heart into the video and we appreciate
   your work very much. If you need to use me as a reference, please do.
   <p>Thanks again...

   <p>I am the Communications coordinator for the Department of Neurosurgery
   at LSU Health Sciences Center in Shreveport, Louisiana. Among my
   responsibilities includes overseeing the transition of many
   departmental materials to digital format for presentations' access via
   database, and storage. This includes coordinating the digitization of
   our existing store of some 10,000 patient neuroimaging studies, which
   have been routinely stored as photo slides over the last eight to ten
   years. After viewing their web presence, speaking personally about our
   needs' and completing a formalized bid process, Larsen Scanning
   Service was selected to implement this initiative.
   <p>As we near the halfway point in this slide digitization process, I can
   say that we in the Department of Neurosurgery have been quite pleased
   with the performance and professionalism of this scanning service. Not
   only are they able to handle the considerable volume of slides in a
   timely fashion, but the application of the digital cleaning system has
   resulted in slides that have been digitally restored to new likeness,
   at times in spite of significant debris and wear to the slide.
   <p>With new sets returning to us on a regular basis, I can safely state
   that Larsen Scanning Service is readily capable to handle high quality
   scanning projects on a large scale with pleasing results. We look
   forward to continuing our digitization process with this company, and
   recommend them to companies or individuals seeking to preserve their
   stores of photo slides.
   <p>Kindest regards,
   <p>Christian B
   <p>LSU
   
   <p>I just want to thank you 10,000 times for providing this service at
   reasonable rates. I just downloaded my hundreds of slides, and am
   extremely happy - fast, accurate service. I'll be giving your name out
   to my colleagues, and we will certainly use you for our business
   slides.
   <p>Best,
   <p>Anne Sullivan
   
   <p>I received my slides and CDs today. I am just thrilled with them. I
   have been busy sending various photos to my children since opening the
   box. Thanks so much for the great, very professional service! I was
   completely satisfied with your service, "ecstatic" might be a better
   word, and had lots of fun sending images to my grown children. There
   weren't any areas where you could have done better.

   <p>I was thoroughly satisfied with your service and appreciated the

   <p>I just had a look at the scans and am very pleased with the layout and
   quality. Thank you once again for treating my small to moderate sized
   order professionally and taking care of it in a timely manner. I plan
   to give the extra CD copies to my sister and brother for Christmas and
   I'm confident they will be pleased and excited! I will not hesitate to
   recommend your services to my colleagues and friends.
