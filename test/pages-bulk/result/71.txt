<h>About Faculty in this Article:

   
 <p>  Pankaj Ghemawat is the Jaime and Josefina Chua Tiampo Professor of
   Business Administration at Harvard Business School.
     

<p>   Want to get a heated debate going among technologists? Ask them this
   question: Can the open source software movement defeat (or severely
   cripple) Microsoft in the marketplace?

 <p>  With little academic attention focused on this question, Harvard
   Business School professors Pankaj Ghemawat and Ramon
   Casadesus-Masanell decided to dive in. Most research to date into the
   OSS movement has focused on the organization and management issues
   surrounding OSS. Ghemawat and Casadesus-Masanell chose to explore the
   fundamental competitive dynamics question: Will OSS ever displace
   traditional software from its market leadership position?

 <p>  "We believe that there is still a great deal of confusion and
   puzzlement on how this competitive battle will develop," say the
   authors of the academic paper Dynamic Mixed Duopoly: A Model Motivated
   by Linux vs. Windows, which has just been accepted for publication in
   a special issue of Management Science.

<p>   Ultimately, the authors believe, neither side is likely to be forced
   from the battlefield--Microsoft has too much market share and OSS
   offers too many benefits for users. But there are strategies each can
   use successfully against the other, as they detail in this e-mail
   interview.

<p>   Sean Silverthorne: Why should OSS ever displace traditional software?

<p>   Ramon Casadesus-Masanell and Pankaj Ghemawat: One main advantage of
   open source software is that because users can modify the code
   directly (as they encounter problems or have new ideas on how to
   improve it), the development cycle is significantly shorter.
   Proponents of OSS claim that if this demand-side learning (as we call
   it) is sufficiently strong, OSS will oust traditional software. In
   addition, software engineers claim that the better architecture of
   most OSS projects make them a potentially superior product, adding to
   the probability of success.

 <p>  However, OSS has disadvantages too. Most importantly, it comes from
   behind in terms of market share (installed base). Because the value of
   an operating system depends critically on the number of users,
   traditional software has an advantage. Clearly, a larger installed
   base implies that there will be stronger direct and indirect network
   effects, and this will enhance the value of the operating system to
   current and potential users. In addition, a larger installed base also
   implies that there will be more feedback on bugs and more suggestions
   for new features.

 <p>  Our paper introduces a dynamic mixed duopoly model in which a
   profit-maximizing competitor (Microsoft) interacts with a competitor
   that prices at zero (Linux), with the installed base affecting their
   relative values over time. We use a formal model to ask what
   conditions are needed for Linux to take over Windows. The questions
   that we address are: Is Linux's superior demand-side learning
   sufficient to win out? What is the effect of forced procurement by
   governments and some large corporations on the long-run equilibrium?
   How do cost asymmetries play out? Can Microsoft use piracy
   strategically to improve its market position?

 <p>  From a managerial perspective, these are significant questions. If it
   turns out that OSS will incontestably displace traditional software,
   software firms need to adapt as quickly as possible to the new
   competitive landscape by, for example, incorporating some aspects of
   the open source development model, or else be ready to exit. In fact,
   the model suggests ways in which the likelihood of OSS winning out can
   be minimized (see below). If, to the contrary, OSS turns out not to be
   a threat to the traditional model, firms should not waste time and
   attention trying to figure out ways to fight this battle.

<p> Could you summarize your results?

<p> First of all, let us make a caveat regarding our approach. Our
   methodology is formal economic modelling. What this means is that we
   construct a stylized mathematical model of the relationship. The model
   captures what we believe are the most important features of the
   Linux-Windows competitive battle (faster demand-side learning on the
   part of Linux and an initial installed base advantage for Windows),
   but makes important assumptions regarding other aspects. Without these
   simplifications, the model would not be tractable and it would not be
   possible to obtain results. After having analyzed the base model, we
   relax some of these assumptions.

 <p>    Harnessing demand-side learning more efficiently is not sufficient
     for Linux to win the competitive battle against Windows.

 <p>  Our main result is that in the absence of cost asymmetries and as long
   as Windows has a first-mover advantage (a larger installed base at
   time zero), Linux never displaces Windows of its leadership position.
   This result holds true regardless of the strength of Linux's
   demand-side learning. Furthermore, the result persists regardless of
   the intrinsically better design and potential differential value of
   Linux. In other words, harnessing demand-side learning more
   efficiently is not sufficient for Linux to win the competitive battle
   against Windows.

<p>   Having obtained this basic result, we investigate the conditions that
   will warrant that Linux ends up forcing Windows out. We do this by
   modifying the model in two ways. First of all, we look at the effect
   of having buyers such as governments and some large corporations
   committed to deployment of Linux in their organizations. We call such
   buyers strategic. In addition to cost-related reasons, governments
   back Linux because having access to the source code allows them to
   verify that sensitive data is treated securely. Binary code makes it
   hard to figure out who has access to information flowing in a network.
   Companies such as IBM, in contrast, back Linux because they see in OSS
   one way to diminish Microsoft's dominance. We find that the presence
   of strategic buyers together with Linux's sufficiently strong
   demand-side learning results in Windows being driven out of the
   market. This may be one main reason why Microsoft has been providing
   chunks of Windows' source code to governments.

 <p>  Second, we look at the role of cost asymmetries. In the base model we
   assume that the cost structures of Windows and Linux for the
   development, distribution, and support of software coincide. A natural
   question is then whether the central result that Windows survives in
   the long-run equilibrium regardless of the speed of Linux's
   demand-side learning persists if there are cost asymmetries. We find
   that because OSS implies lower profits for Microsoft, the larger the
   cost differences are between Linux and Windows, the less able
   Microsoft is to guarantee the survival of Windows.

 <p>  We also show that it is not all bad news to Microsoft. We analyze the
   effect of having forward-looking buyers and the presence of piracy,
   and conclude that both benefit Microsoft.

<p>   We question the effectiveness of influencing forward-looking buyers'
   perceptions on the value of an operating system. The model suggests
   that the more forward-looking buyers are, the more advantageous it is
   to use fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) tactics to drive the
   competing system out. Consider SCO, a small "vulture" firm that had
   bought up the intellectual property rights to a particular version of
   Unix and threatened Linux users with lawsuits over infringement of
   those rights unless they agree to pay substantial licensing fees. IBM,
   which was one of the prime corporate sponsors of Linux as well as the
   target of a lawsuit by SCO that sought $1 billion in damages, alleged
   in mid-2003 that SCO was in cahoots with Microsoft. Our model
   indicates that if buyers are sufficiently forward-looking, such
   actions may jeopardize the ability of Linux to continue as an
   effective competitor in the operating system space.

 <p>  We also look at the effect of piracy and ask whether piracy can ever
   be beneficial to Microsoft. This extension was motivated by analyzing
   data on a cross-section of countries on Linux penetration and piracy
   rates. We found that in countries where piracy is highest, Linux has
   the lowest penetration rate. The model shows that Microsoft can use
   piracy as an effective tool to price discriminate, and that piracy may
   even result in higher profits to Microsoft!

 <p>  Finally, the paper investigates the societal welfare consequences of
   OSS availability by comparing different industry structures (monopoly
   and duopoly). We find that while a monopoly of Linux is always
   preferable (from the point of view of societal welfare) to a Windows
   monopoly, it is ambiguous whether a duopoly Linux-Windows is better
   than a Windows monopoly.

 <p>  The basic trade-off is the following: With a duopoly, more individuals
   and organizations use PCs because prices are lower, and this raises
   welfare. However, with a duopoly, no operating system ends up
   exploiting fully its potential because developers' efforts wind up
   divided between the two systems. However, with a monopoly, the efforts
   to develop new software and improve the platform are directed towards
   one system only and this may turn out to be better from a social
   welfare perspective.

 <p>  Q: In general, what surprised you about the results? What assumptions
   did you have going in that didn't hold up?

 <p>  A: When we began the project, we thought that network effects and
   demand-side learning would result in Linux forcing Windows out. After
   all, we reasoned, if Windows is sold at a positive price and Linux is
   free, there will always be Linux users, and if the strength of Linux's
   network effect is large, the value of Linux to prospective users
   should eventually become larger than that of Windows.

 <p>  Well... we were wrong (and this illustrates the usefulness of
   developing a formal model). What we had missed is that Microsoft's
   initial advantage (larger installed base) together with its pricing
   power allow the company to price strategically to control Linux's
   market share going forward. By lowering the price of Windows, the
   demand for Linux shrinks to the point where Linux is not a threat to
   the survival of Windows. The model also shows that a "milking
   strategy" (setting high prices in the short term and leaving the
   market at some point in the future) is not desirable to Microsoft. The
   reason is that if Microsoft follows such a strategy, as the last
   period becomes closer and closer, the relative benefit of abandoning
   it and lowering prices to survive a few more periods increases
   dramatically.

 <p>    The model shows that Microsoft can use piracy as an effective tool
     to price discriminate, and that piracy may even result in higher
     profits to Microsoft!

 <p>  The "Windows persistence" result turns out to be robust to different
   specifications of the model. In fact, in the first few months into the
   project we had developed several alternative models and every one of
   them yielded this very same finding.

 <p>  In addition to this main result, we were also surprised to find that
   piracy may end up increasing Microsoft's profits. To understand why,
   notice that there are two types of pirates: those who would not have
   bought Windows in the first place because it is too expensive, and
   those who would have bought Windows but now decide to pirate it. The
   first category increases Windows' installed base without affecting
   sales. As a consequence, this group increases the value of Windows.
   And thanks to these pirates, Microsoft is able to set higher prices in
   the future (because the value of the system goes up). In addition,
   having these pirates means that Linux's installed base does not grow
   as much as it would have if piracy weren't there. The second type of
   pirates (those who in the absence of piracy would have bought Windows)
   reduces Windows' sales and profit. Thus, if the proportion of
   first-type pirates is sufficiently large, Microsoft's profits will
   increase with piracy.

 <p>  Finally, the social welfare result that a Windows monopoly is not
   always worse than a Linux-Windows monopoly was also unexpected. This
   questions the social desirability of policies aimed at guaranteeing
   Linux's survival.

<p>   Q: You mention in the paper that the model is not to be taken as a
   literal model of the Linux/Microsoft competition. But can you say
   anything about why Linux has enjoyed success against Microsoft?

 <p>  A: Linux's success against Microsoft is still relative. In the client
   space, Windows is the undisputable leader, and in the server space,
   Linux and Windows have both been gaining positions for the past ten
   years. The big losers are Novell, Unix, Solaris... everybody except
   Linux and Windows.

 <p>  Despite this, Microsoft is visibly concerned about Linux's upsurge.
   The Halloween memos  are an
   obvious testimony of this concern: "OSS poses a direct, short-term
   revenue and platform threat to Microsoft, particularly in server
   space. Additionally, the intrinsic parallelism and free idea exchange
   in OSS has benefits that are not replicable with our current licensing
   model and therefore present a long-term developer mindshare threat."

<p>   Microsoft has a great deal to lose if Linux wins the operating systems
   battle. Microsoft is a software company, and a defeat in operating
   systems would point to the vulnerability of its entire business
   portfolio. In addition, the operating systems group is one of
   Microsoft's biggest revenue generators. Moreover, to a large extent
   Microsoft's sustained success over time in such a dreadfully rugged
   landscape has been due to its dominant position in operating systems.
   It is well known that Microsoft won the browser wars leveraging its
   dominant position in client operating systems. And the same will
   happen in the media player space unless the American or European
   antitrust authorities prevent it. We expect Microsoft to put all its
   ammunition to fight this battle.

 <p>  Part of the reason why Linux has made significant inroads is the
   determination of Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation to
   have a free (as in freedom) operating system. According to Stallman,
   application software will never be truly free unless there is a free
   operating system that supports it. Thus, since the moment Linus
   Torvalds and Richard Stallman joined forces, a big chunk of the
   foundation's efforts have been directed at building a free operating
   system.

<p>   Then there are some large corporations and governments backing the
   development of Linux. These players use Linux as a way to curb
   Microsoft's dominance. This support is important because there are
   tedious portions of the code that would rarely be developed
   spontaneously by members of the Linux-developer community.

<p>   Q: From your modelling, what can Microsoft do strategically to remain
   competitive against a product that is argued to be of better quality,
   is updated more frequently, and is free?

<p>   A: A few actions that the model suggests Microsoft could do to remain
   competitive are:
<p> Increase its own demand-side learning.
       <l> Listen to the demands of the user community to better exploit
            the benefits of demand-side learning. Microsoft must
            facilitate communication between the user base and the
            company to have prompt feedback on the performance of its
            products.
        <l>. Make an effort to incorporate improvements in the code (fix
            bugs and introduce new features) as soon as possible.
        <l>. Reward those who propose improvements for the code. At the
            very least, Microsoft could publicly acknowledge those who
            proposed new features or discovered bugs.
 <p> Feed its direct and indirect network effects.
        <l> Support as much as possible the independent software vendor
            community so that the quantity and quality of complements is
            substantially above that of Linux.
       <l>. Encourage competition between the different ISVs. The lower
            the prices of applications, the more appealing the Microsoft
            system will be.
       <l>   c. Price discriminate. Give Windows and applications away to
            schools and universities so that users build their file
            libraries on Microsoft, not Linux.
    <p> c. Minimize the number of strategic buyers.
  <l>    a. Let governments access the source code and give guarantees
            that sensitive data is treated confidentially.
  <l>    b. Price discriminate. Give binary away to organizations and
            individuals who are not willing to spend money on Windows but
            who would be willing to use Linux because it is free.
 <p>   d. Reduce costs to be able to sustain long periods of time with low
       prices.
 <p>   e. Decrease Linux's demand-side learning.
         a. Because the way to do this involves some questionable (from a
            legal point of view) actions, we will refrain from suggesting
            specifics.
 <p>   f. Lessen Linux's direct and indirect network effects.
  <l>       a. Make it as hard as possible for Windows applications to work
            on Linux.
  <l>       b. Same for MS Office documents.
   <l>      c. "Promote" Linux's code forking.
 <p>   g. Infuse fear, uncertainty, and doubt into the Linux user community.
       For this to work, the statements must be perceived as credible.
       Credibility requires some past FUD announcements to be realized.

 <p>  Q: Is there a scenario where Linux could be kicked out of the market
   by Microsoft?

 <p>  A: Strictly speaking, within our model the only way in which Microsoft
   can get rid of Linux is by setting the price at zero. But, even if
   Microsoft did that, the company would still be selling MS Office for a
   positive price. Thus, we conjecture that even in this case, there
   would be people developing and using Linux.

 <p>  The more important question is: What motivates developers to
   contribute to open source projects in the first place? As long as the
   drivers are there, Linux will persist. Given that Linux was born in
   1992 in an industry already dominated by Microsoft, and given that the
   financial motive is secondary, it will be very hard for anyone to oust
   Linux.

 <p>  The organizational stream of research on OSS has identified several
   drivers of motivation to contribute to open source projects. For
   Microsoft to have a chance to kick Linux out of the market, it needs
   to successfully fight them.

 <p>  First, some developers see software as scientific knowledge to be
   shared "like the sharing of recipes among cooks." In fact, some
   describe software developers more like artists seeking fun, challenge,
   and beauty in their work than like calculative, square-minded
   engineers. Second, some individuals find it fun to go against
   Microsoft. As the OSS/free software movement gains momentum and
   developers foresee that victory is within reach, they increase their
   effort to accomplish this. Third, because most OSS projects have a log
   file listing all contributors to the code, some developers find it
   desirable to participate in OSS projects to signal their ability and
   to enhance their chances of promotion and professional advancement.
   Finally, user-developers sometimes fix bugs that they find and then
   release the improved code so that everybody can benefit.

 <p>    It will be very hard for anyone to oust Linux.

<p>   To the motivations of independent developers to contribute to Linux,
   we have to add the important support that the free operating system
   receives from companies and governments. As long as the motives that
   induce these organizations to back Linux persist, Linux will not go
   away.

<p>   Finally, and as we mentioned above, having a free operating system is
   central to the mission of the Free Software Foundation, Richard
   Stallman, and Linus Torvalds. It is thus hard to see how Microsoft can
   "persuade" Stallman or Torvalds to cave. And even if it did... Linux
   is no longer Stallman's or Torvalds' property. The project is
   dispersed and there is no "owner" of the code. Thus, someone else can
   take the lead.

 <p>  Q: What's next for the both of you for future research projects?

<p>   A: There are several ways in which our work on Linux can be extended.
   One avenue would be to empirically estimate the difference in
   demand-side learning between Linux and Windows. This would allow us to
   make educated guesses on the chances of survival of Windows and make
   managerial and policy recommendations to OSS advocates, Microsoft, and
   administrations.

 <p>  In its present form, the paper models the organization of Linux's
   development in a very stylized way. Having a closer look at issues of
   effort coordination may help us better understand how to deal with
   code forking, one of OSS's biggest potential problems.

 <p>  A second organizational issue that could also benefit from formal
   analysis is that of incentives to contribute to OSS. While most
   research on this issue has been sociological in nature, the economic
   approach may shed light on why supposedly rational individuals are
   willing to spend valuable time and effort without extrinsic, financial
   incentives.

 <p>  A final question that we believe is of utmost importance but that has
   not attracted much attention thus far (at least among academics) is:
   What are the drivers of adoption of OSS? Aside from its empirical
   relevance for both individuals and organizations, it is an interesting
   question from a theoretical point of view, too. The presence of
   network effects and demand-side learning make this a non-trivial
   problem. We conjecture that there are multiple equilibria and that the
   use of FUD to mold perceptions about future value becomes crucial.
