   <h>ViaVoice 10 Review: Patience Is A Virtue
   <h>By Gerry Blackwell
   <p>March 17, 2003
   <p>For the keyboard impaired, the disabled, or anyone who just thinks the
   idea of talking to a computer is kind of cool, speech recognition has
   enormous appeal.

   <p>You talk and the computer types. Or you talk and the computer does
   your bidding. The potential productivity benefits are phenomenal.

   <p>I decided to look at speech recognition again when I began to
   experience chronic tendonitis in my mouse elbow. I figured using voice
   commands would save much mousing, and thus much pain and discomfort. A
   good idea, but one that hasn't worked out so far.

   <p>Speech recognition is a little like bears dancing. It's so amazing
   that computers can do it at all; you're almost willing to forgive them
   for not being able to do it very well. Almost willing.

   <p>The technology has been around for over ten years now and it's
   supposedly getting better all the time. It has improved from the state
   of the art a few years ago when I last looked at this technology.

   <p>But based on my experience reviewing the latest version of IBM's
   marketing-leading ViaVoice product -- ViaVoice for Windows, Pro USB
   Edition, Release 10 -- speech recognition still has a way to go.

   <h>Great When It Works 
   <p>ViaVoice, when it works well, is a marvelous tool. You can dictate to
   Word and other programs, including Outlook and Outlook Express,
   Microsoft's e-mail and personal information management programs, and
   see your words appear magically on the screen without having to touch
   the keyboard.

   <p>You can create dictation macros to insert your address in a document,
   for example, or call a boilerplate paragraph.

   <p>You can issue commands to and make menu selections in most Windows
   programs. You can even use natural language commands in some Microsoft
   Office programs -- for example, say, "Make the document Arial bold
   blue" to change the type face, or "Create a table here with three rows
   and four columns."

   <p>You can issue voice commands to launch programs -- "Start program
   Microsoft Word." You can surf the Web with voice commands. And you can
   create voice command macros to perform a series of actions.

   <p>But getting to the point where you're fluent in ViaVoice is no
   cakewalk. It takes a significant commitment of time and patience to
   install, configure and learn to use the program. And it does not work
   well on all systems -- which is to say, it didn't work well on my test
   system.

   <h>Can You Hear Me Now? 
   <p>The problems started with installing the included Plantronics DSP-300
   headset microphone, a highly rated noise canceling microphone that
   supposedly ensures optimum speech recognition performance.

   <p>The Plantronics instructions included a sticky note pasted over the
   unit's USB plug marked, "Install software before plugging in headset!"
   The trouble is, you can't install the software on a Windows XP
   computer without first plugging in the hardware.

   <p>Sorting out this confusion took a call to Plantronics' technical
   support -- but only after 45 minutes of fruitless effort on my part --
   and then downloading a new XP version of the headset software. Even
   so, the software Plantronics supplied doesn't have a Windows XP
   signature certifying that it's 100 percent compatible. This may
   explain some later problems.

   <p>Installing the ViaVoice software itself was relatively painless. But
   once installed, the next step is to "train" the system to understand
   your particular speech patterns by dictating the provided text.

   <p>Count on at least 20 to 30 minutes just to do the bare minimum of
   training. After that, the program supposedly improves in accuracy the
   more you use it. In the meantime, don't expect instant productivity.

   <p>For one thing, many of the voice commands you'll want to use -- you
   can always display a pop-up list of available commands by saying,
   "What can I say?" -- turn out to be "not trained" yet.

   <p>Before ViaVoice will respond to these commands, you need to double
   click on the command in the What-can-I-say list to launch a dialog
   that allows you to speak the words so ViaVoice can learn your
   pronunciation.

   <h>Command And Dictate 
   <p>ViaVoice has two distinct modes -- command and dictate. To move to
   dictation mode, in which the program transcribes every word you say,
   you speak a command -- "Dictate to Word," for example.

   <p>It's amazing how much of your dictation the system will interpret
   correctly after even minimal training. You can even configure it to
   interpret dictation recorded on a voice recorder.

   <p>But specialized vocabulary -- such as the vocabulary related to the
   high-tech topics I routinely write about -- and proper names are still
   a big problem. You can tell ViaVoice to analyze a collection of your
   documents to find "new" words that it doesn't know that you're likely
   to use.

   <p>When I did that it turned up a long, long list. I then had to go
   through the word-by-word training process described above. It's
   tedious.

   <p>You can also spell words while dictating, first issuing a voice
   command to move into spell mode, then saying each letter in the word
   or name.

   <p>But mistakes will inevitably be made, and mistakes slow everything
   down. To correct mistakes you either select them with a mouse and type
   over them -- which theoretically helps the system recognize the word
   better next time -- or use an unwieldy voice command process that
   involves selecting the correct word from a list of possible
   alternates.

   <h>Troublesome Troubleshooting 
   <p>Beyond these almost inevitable start-up and learning issues, ViaVoice
   did not perform well on my system, a Dell 1.7GHz Pentium 4 machine
   with 256MB of RAM and gigabytes of free storage.

   <p>In most sessions, the Plantronics microphone did not work without
   repeatedly going into set-up dialogs and repeating steps that
   theoretically only needed to be done once -- a problem I'm guessing
   relates to the Plantronics software.

   <p>Even when the audio set-up procedure reported that the microphone was
   adjusted for "excellent" reception, the system had difficulty
   interpreting many of my voice commands -- even commands for which it
   was trained or for which I had made a point of training it using the
   word-by-word method.

   <p>Worse, ViaVoice appeared to make the whole system slightly unstable --
   shades of the bad old Windows 98 days on my normally rock solid XP
   machine. Programs would crash; ViaVoice would simply stop recognizing
   anything.

   <p>In fairness to ViaVoice, at least some of these problems may have had
   to do with resource shortages -- mine is a loaded system and I run
   McAffee's virus protection tools which eat up memory, which ViaVoice
   also needs.

   <p>On the other hand, my system falls well within the program's system
   requirements and it should certainly be able to co-exist with McAffee.

   <p>When it works the way it's supposed to work -- and I did see flashes
   of this -- ViaVoice is a very impressive product. The question is, is
   it worth the trouble of getting it to work the way it's supposed to
   work?

   <h>Parting Thoughts 
   <p>I know from talking to attorneys and radiologists who started using
   the technology years ago when it new and nowhere near as sophisticated
   that it is possible to get past the start-up woes I experienced and
   realize real productivity gains with speech recognition. I believe
   them. I just haven't experienced it yet.

   <p>Recommendation: Buy only if you have real need -- disability,
   repetitive strain injury, serious keyboard incompetence -- and count
   on a steep learning curve. Remember, patience is a virtue.
