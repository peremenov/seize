   <p>WITH PRODUCT names like 5-Day High-Fiber Cleanse and Soyamax, it may
   surprise you just how quickly Salt Lake City-based Usana Health
   Sciences (USNA) is expanding. The marketer of nutritional and cosmetic
   products has seen its number of sales associates climb 35% in the past
   year as its profits surged 70%. And its stock returns make Avon
   Products' (AVP) three-year cumulative gain of 94% and vitamin seller
   NBTY's (NTY) 40% jump look paltry. Usana's shares during that time
   have spiked more than 3,000%.

   <p>It's not history that concerns us today, though. There's reason to
   believe that Usana's streamlined business model, which relies on a
   global network of independent sellers to peddle its products, is
   poised to continue delivering strong profits. The company turned up
   recently on our Efficiency Experts screen.

   <p>We gauge companies' efficiency using return on equity, or ROE. The
   measure is calculated by dividing profits by shareholders' equity, or
   book value. In other words, ROE tells us how much earnings a company
   can squeeze out of what it owns. Managers are often paid according to
   how high they can boost their companies' ROEs. That's generally, but
   not always, good for shareholders.

   <p>Here's why. ROE is the product of three other ratios multiplied
   together: profit margin (profits/sales), asset turns (sales/assets)
   and leverage (assets/equity). (The two "sales" and two "assets" cancel
   out, leaving profits over equity, or ROE.) So to increase ROE,
   managers need to increase one or more of its three components. If they
   can fatten margins by, say, cutting costs, or increase asset turns by
   making new products with existing machinery (a la Honey Nut Cheerios),
   all the better. But they can also goose ROE simply by employing
   borrowed funds -- which is not always in the best interest of
   long-term shareholders.

   <p>So pay careful attention to debt when assessing ROE. For our
   Efficiency Experts search, we also use return on invested capital, or
   ROIC. It works like ROE, but adds debt to, rather than subtracts it
   from, the bottom half of the ratio, which makes overborrowers look
   duly bad. Run this screen for yourself anytime using our stock
   screener and the recipe to the right. Recently, it turned up 12
   companies, including Usana Health Sciences.

   <p>Despite its recent rapid growth, Usama isn't a big company. Its $550
   million market cap and $241 million in trailing 12-month sales put it
   firmly in small-cap territory. About 69% of its 2003 revenue came from
   nutritional products, including vitamins, fiber supplements and
   protein powders. Top sellers include Usana Essentials (22% of total
   sales), a multivitamin, and Proflavinol (9%), a free-radical-busting
   pill. The company's Sense line of skin-care products contributed 12%
   of sales, and combination packages of goods from both product lines,
   as well as sales-training materials, made up the rest.

   <p>North America accounts for only about two-thirds of Usana's sales.
   Australia and New Zealand together make up 15% of revenue, Taiwan
   contributes 7% and Hong Kong, 4%. Newer markets for the company
   include Mexico, Japan, South Korea and Singapore. Most sales go
   through network-marketing associates, but the company has a
   preferred-customer list of people who can buy products for personal
   use (but not resell them), which contributes about 15% of sales.

   <p>Second-quarter results for the company, reported July 20, showed sales
   increasing 43% year-over-year to $67.2 million and profits ballooning
   70% to $7.4 million. Per-share earnings of 36 cents, up from a
   year-earlier 20 cents, surpassed analysts' expectations by three
   cents. The company had 104,000 sales associates at quarter's end, up
   from 77,000 a year ago.

   <p>Chief Executive Dave Wentz credited the strong results to associate
   recruitment, and noted that he recently replaced managers in two key
   growth markets that have thus far been underperforming: Japan and
   South Korea. David Block, an analyst with Los Angeles-based stock
   research firm Seidler Cos., sees potential in Asia.

   <p>"With the company yet to crack the code in exploiting the enormous
   market opportunity in Japan, the world's second-largest direct-sales
   market, we are cautiously optimistic that Japan's new [general
   manager] will finally drive the market forward," wrote Block in a July
   21 research note. He calls the stock "an excellent long-term
   investment" and notes that the most important metric to watch is
   associate growth, since it's correlated so closely with sales. (Block
   doesn't own shares of Usana; Seidler Cos. doesn't have an
   investment-banking relationship with the company.)

   <p>Just how efficiently is Usana Health Sciences operating right now? It
   has posted trailing 12-month profits of $26.5 million, on
   shareholders' equity of $44.4 million as of its second-quarter filing,
   for a ROE of about 60%. The median ROE for the companies that make up
   the Standard & Poor's 500 index is 15%. Since expanding its associate
   network requires little by way of capital investment, the larger Usana
   is able to grow its sales force, the higher its ROE will likely rise.
   Consider that direct-seller Avon today has a ROE of about 130%.

   <p>How pricey are Usana's shares after their recent run-up? They trade
   presently at 19.9 times Reuters Research's three-analyst 2004 earnings
   consensus of $1.44 per share. The average price/earnings multiple for
   personal and household products sellers is 19.7; Avon's P/E is 24.5.
   Usana is projected by analysts to grow earnings by 17.5% annually over
   the next five years, faster than the group's 8.6% and Avon's 15.0%.
   That gives the stock a price/earnings-to-growth, or PEG, ratio of
   1.14, well below peers' 2.29, Avon's 1.63 and the S&P 500's 1.53,
   suggesting that this nutrient seller's shares may still have plenty of
   strong growth ahead.
