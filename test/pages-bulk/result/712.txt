   <h>Here's how teens can reduce risk of assault

   <p>Schoolâs ending and summerâs starting. Forget about rules, letâs
   party! Hold on there â summer is the best time for adventure, but you
   want it to be memorable for the magical moments, not the bad things
   that might happen.
   <p>Some summer dangers are obviousâlike sunburn, bug bites and poison
   ivy. These are easily preventable: wear sunscreen and cover up in long
   loose layers when in the woods or tall grass.
   <p>Other dangers are less obvious. For example, sexual predators can take
   advantage of the unsupervised days and late nights to prey on young
   people, either online or in person. Attractive promises can entice
   youth into risky situations.
   <p>	âOften these adults offer to take young people camping, or provide a
   place to party or swim. These adults or older adolescents gain the
   trust of their teen âfriends,â and then sexually assault them,â
   explains Judi Fairholm, National Manager for RespectED: Violence &
   Abuse Prevention at the Canadian Red Cross.

<h>Drugs and alcohol increase vulnerability

   <p>Drugs and alcohol are often used as an enticement. Unfortunately,
   these only increase the vulnerability of young people, who may be too
   stoned to fight, and who may feel trapped into keeping the secret
   because they broke the rules. Awareness is the first line of defense.
     <l>Understand that it is not usual or healthy for older people to
       want to hang out with young friends.
     <l> Hang out with people close to your own age, and with whom you feel
       safe.
     <l> Always feel free to say ânoâ to luring offers -- even if feels
       like youâre hurting someoneâs feelings.

<h>Dating violence

   <p>Dating violence and sexual assault among teens is also far too common.
   In fact, studies have found as many as 25% of teens will experience
   violence in a dating relationship before they reach adulthood.
   Unsupervised open-air parties provide a warm and romantic setting, but
   things can quickly become too hot to handle, especially when drinking
   or drugs are in the mix.
   <p>âEveryone has the right to establish boundaries and expect respect,
   that they have a right to refuse any sexual activity, and that they
   have the responsibility to always respect the limits another person
   sets,â Ms. Fairholm stresses.
   <p>Alcohol and drugs significantly increase risk of assaults. âWe know
   that 74% of males and 55% of females involved in acquaintance rapes
   had been drinking or taking drugs just before the attack.â
   <p>Peer violence can also pose a problem. While we usually associate
   bullying with the schoolyard, in fact, the lack of school supervision
   can lead to increased risk. Is there violence or the threat of
   violence in your social circle? Do you feel safe and valued with your
   group? If not, find new friends -- seriously. Loneliness is awful, but
   no one deserves to be someone elseâs punching bag, verbally,
   physically or emotionally.

<h>Safety plan

   <p>You can have fun and stay safe by developing a safety plan.
     <l> Tell your parents where you are going and when youâll be home. It
       shouldnât make you feel like a kid; after all, adults usually let
       their loved ones know where theyâll be!
     <l> Attend gatherings only with trusted friends.
     <l> Designate someone who will remain sober and drug-free throughout.
       Anyone who will be driving must remain sober and straight, of
       course, but even if thereâs no driving, there should be someone
       whoâs keeping a sober watch.
     <l> Stay with the group and donât go off alone with a suitor; if you
       leave one place, make sure your friends know where youâve gone and
       with whom.
     <l> Have a plan to call for help immediately if things start to get
       out of hand.
     <l> Donât be afraid to seek assistance from adults.

   <p>Most importantly, friends need to take care of one another, and
   everybody must listen to their instincts and heed the earliest warning
   signs.
