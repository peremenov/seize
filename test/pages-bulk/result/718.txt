   we have broken the on-line slide rule catalogs into smaller sections.
   Just CLICK on the icon of the rule type you are looking for at the
   left, to see the matching catalog. Large graphical catalogs are a bit
   SLOW, please give them time to load.

   <p>* We have been lucky to find a wide variety of original slide rule
   manuals and hardcover books from all over the world. We have POST,
   K+E, Faber-Castell, and Hemmi manuals, plus some very useful general
   books to help you get the best value out of your favorite slide rule.

   <p>We have quite a bit of trouble finding good copies, especially of K+E
   hardcovers, and we can't always ensure we have all of these in stock,
   as locating them is a bit of a hit-and-miss thing. What we have
   changes every month, so check this page regularly if you are looking
   for something you don't see today.
