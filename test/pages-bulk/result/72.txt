<h>A Troubling Study of the Contracts Between Medical Schools and Corporate
Research Sponsors

 <p>  The NEJM article about contracts for clinical trials between academic
   health centers (AHCs) and pharmaceutical companies mentioned in an
   earlier post deserves further attention. (The study is available here,
   and its citation is Mello MM, Clarridge BR, Studdert DM. Academic
   medical centers' standards for clinical-trial agreements with
   industry. N Engl J Med 2005; 352: 21.)
   
<p>   First, let me summarze the study's design. The authors sent a survey
   to senior administrators in the offices of sponsored research in 122
   medical schools. They received responses from 107, for 91% response
   rate, excluding four schools that did no clinical research. They asked
   the administrators questions about provisions they would usually allow
   in contracts between their medical schools and corporate sponsors. The
   proportions who would allow some particular research practices follow:
    
<l> The sponsor will own the data produced by the research - 80%
<l> The sponsor will store the data and release portions to the
       investigator - 35%
<l> The investigators (whether at your site or any other site) are not
       permitted to alter the study design after the agreement is
       executed - 68%
<l>The sponsor is permitted to alter the study design after the
       agreement is executed - 62%
<l> The sponsor may prohibit individual site investigators from
       publishing manuscripts independently of the sponsor or group - 15%
<l> The sponsor may include its own statistical analysis in
       manuscripts - 24%
<l> The sponsor will write up the results for publication and the
       investigators may review the manuscript and suggest revisions -
       50%
<l> While the trial is going on, the investigators may not discuss
       research results (including presentations at scientific meetings)
       with people not involved in the trial - 66%
<l> After the trial is over, the investigators may not discuss
       research results (including presentations at scientific meetings)
       until the sponsor consents to dissemination - 21%
<l> The terms of the clinical-trial agreement are confidential - 62%
<l> After the trial is over, the industry sponsor may prohibit
       investigators from sharing raw research data with third parties -
       41%

 <p>  In summary, this study suggests that some medical schools will
   acquiesce to contracts that prevent their faculty from having
   meaningful control over research projects for which they are the
   ostensible investigators. Some medical schools will allow corporate
   research sponsors to manipulate the design, analysis, and
   interpretation of results to increase the likelihood of getting the
   results the sponsor wants. For example, 50% of medical schools would
   allow the corporate sponsor to write manuscripts reporting on study
   results, and only allow faculty to "suggest revisions." Thus, many
   medical schools acquiesce to contracts that could allow corporate
   sponsors to ghost-write articles. Furthermore, more than half of the
   medical schools acquiesce to contracts that are kept confidential,
   preventing easy discovery of manipulation of the conduct and
   dissemination of the research by the corporate sponsor.

 <p>  (To see specific techniques that corporate sponsors may use to
   increase the likelihood that research produces the results they want,
   see our earlier post about the article entitled "Medical Journals Are
   an Extension of the Marketing Arm of Pharmaceutical Companies" by
   Richard Smith.)

 <p>  To underline the context, in my experience, to do clinical research,
   most medical school faculty are strongly pressured by their
   institutions to obtain external funding to support this work. Those
   who cannot obtain funding within a few years of unemployment often
   have to find something else to do other than research. However,
   although faculty are expected to find sources of funding, it is
   generally the medical schools or academic medical centers, not the
   researchers, who negotiate research agreements, and although such
   agreements may bind faculty members, the money paid under their
   auspices generally goes directly to the faculty member's employer.
   Thus, individual researchers are under considerable pressure to find
   grant and contract funding, and to keep their financial sponsors
   happy, but must work under whatever contract provisions their
   employers negotiate.

 <p>  The New England Journal of Medicine article clearly suggests that some
   medical schools allow researchers to be bound by agreements that allow
   the study's sponsor to manipulate study design, analysis, and
   interpretation to make it more likely that the results will be to the
   sponsor's liking. Since clinical trials enroll real human beings as
   subjects with the promise that the data they contribute, and the risks
   they run, will lead to valid scientific results, allowing such
   manipulation appears to not only likely to produce biased results, but
   also to be allow unethical exploitation of human subjects, and thus is
   in conflict with the medical school's scientific and humanitarian
   mission.

 <p>  This is yet another illustration of leaders of powerful health care
   organizations acting in conflict with physicians' and medical
   researchers' core values.

 <p>  One can only hope that publicizing such practices will lead to more
   ethical research, and less exploitation of human subjects.

<p>   By the way, I do not in any sense mean to blame the research
   administrators who must try to negotiate these contracts. Note that
   69% of the administrators "perceived that competition for research
   funds created pressure on administrators to compromise on the language
   of the contract." 24% described the pressure as "great." I do blame
   the higher leadership of the medical schools for fostering a climate
   in which money is more important than doing valid, ethical research.
   This raises several important questions:
    
 <l> Why don't some medical school leaders enforce clearer ethical
       standards for clinical research sponsored by industry?
 <l>  Are they so worried about getting the money, and so worried that
       they will lose contracts if they insist on ethical standards?
 <l>  Are they so steeped in the exteme relativism of the post-modernist
       university that they don't believe in such standards?
 <l>  Are they so used to violating their own mission to support
       political causes, as is documented again and again on the FIRE
       web-site, that they aren't troubled by violating their mission for
       economic reasons?

 <p>    Maybe it's time we start trying to address such questions.

 <p>    * This study builds on our 2002 work. Multicenter clinical trial
       research is governed by standard agreements at all sites
       participating in a study-there really is little variablity within
       a study, only some varaibility across studies. The final result is
       that when patients are randomized, the institution has not
       assuance that the sponsor will publish the overall trial results,
       not that there will be an independent process to assess whether in
       fact the trial is publishable. Since the definition of research is
       the creation of generalizable knowledge, site investigators at
       academic medical centers are in fact deceiving patients when they
       recruit them to multicenter clinical trials if they ask them to
       participate in a research study under current agreements. Even
       with the 2001 guidelines, the 2002 paper and now this paper, there
       looks to be little pressure to change practices. Further, we need
       a single ethical standard for research-otherwise trials will move
       to non-academic sites in the US or off-shore.

       
 <p>    * To people with experience in the area, these recent revelations
       will not be a surprise. The new interest is in getting firm
       information on the scale of it.
       
 <p>      Nevertheless, one should be cautions about interpreting some of
       these things at face value. For example, the 50% of cases where
       "The sponsor will write up the results for publication and the
       investigators may review the manuscript and suggest revisions" may
       seem a bit scandalous, in view of the opportuinity for distortion
       which it provides.
       
 <p>      But one can also consider that a sponsor contracts the
       investigation to an academic research team because they have the
       clinical/laboratory/library facilities, and the technical
       expertise, to perform a good investigation; while the sponsor has
       expertise in trial design, trial monitoring, regulatory
       requirements, and statistics. That sponsor may do a thoroughly
       ethical job.
      
 <p>     I'm sure we're all aware of cases where a sponsor would be unwise
       to keave trial design and statistics to a particular clinical
       research team!
      
<p>      On the other hand, the sponsor may not do an ethical job (that
       door is after all open).
      
 <p>     So, in interpreting (e.g.) that 50%, one would like to know what
       proporion of it led to an ethically good outcome, and what
       proportion led to distortion of the results.
      
 <p>     On occasion, individual researchers vlow the whistle. Often, they
       may be reluctant.
      
<p>      On the context of what the terms of research contracts should be,
       perhaps they should spell out not only who does what, but also why
       (e.g. the clinical team do not have experience in trial design).
      
 <p>     Ultimately, it would be desirable that all participants should be
       independent of the sponsor and responsible for the integrity of
       the operation. But perhaps that is utopian.

 <p>     By Ted Harding
      
<p>     * There are a lot of bright people paying attention to clinical
       trials: sponsor, clinical physicians, FDA, editors, referees, and
       readers. All have interests and different levels of power. The FDA
       examines raw data sets. It is not easy to imagine that the
       situation is all that bad. On the other hand, physicians have to
       evaluate journal articles from non-randomized studies. These are
       the Wild, Wild West. Hundreds of questions can be asked and a few,
       most likely false positive, results are reported. No one can check
       anything as near as I can tell. Ask for study details like the SAS
       code used for the analysis or the raw data and most likely you
       will get stonewalled. Most of this research is government funded.
       The vast majority of epidemiology studies do not replicate and
       epidemiologists don't appear to care.
