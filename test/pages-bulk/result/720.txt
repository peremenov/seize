<h>Hack job

<p>Don't hail Taxi, a tired comedy undermined by the acting of Jimmy Fallon
(annoying) and Queen Latifah (on cruise control).

   <p>Catching a cab during Manhattan's rush hour is easier than finding a
   decent joke in Taxi, the latest film proving that a Not Ready for
   Prime Time Player isn't ready for the movies, either.

   <p>Jimmy Fallon, arguably the most annoying Saturday Night Live performer
   since Joe Piscopo, goes the usual cops-and-robbers route taken by
   countless TV comedians hoping to become movie stars. As a cop, he's
   everything that would get a guy fired from the force. As a robber,
   he'll do just fine stealing moviegoers' money until they wise up.

   <p>Fallon plays Andy Washburn, a discredit to New York's police
   department after plowing his cruiser into one of those fruit stands
   that never remains intact in sloppy action comedies. His boss,
   incredibly foxy Lt. Marta Robbins (Jennifer Esposito), even more
   incredibly dated Andy before her promotion, so he gets a little more
   leash. A muzzle would be more appropriate to stifle Fallon's nervous
   line deliveries.

   <p>When a bank robbery occurs, Andy hails a cab driven by feisty Belle
   Williams, a walk-through role for Queen Latifah, Fallon's accomplice
   in ticket-sale crime. They can't stand each other, so they're perfect
   partners in such circumstances; he mumbles, she shrieks, and they act
   endangered while stunt drivers do all the hard work.

   <p>It turns out the robberies are performed by a gang of hotties led by
   supermodel Gisele Bundchen. Even more unbelievable is Belle's taxi, a
   souped-up Crown Victoria that goes Transformer on occasion with air
   spoilers, a supercharger and cool rims. Nearly as unbelievable is that
   in a film titled Taxi, Andy and Belle spend so little time riding in
   one. This is something like Collateral with no interest.

   <p>The plot slackens with intrusions by Belle's hunky lover (Henry
   Simmons) and Andy's alcoholic mother (Ann-Margret, who should be
   ashamed). Everyone plods through the obligatory explosions and
   gunfights, car wrecks that went out of style 20 years ago, and a brush
   with laughing gas when it's the audience that could use it. Tired
   stuff, and neither Fallon nor Latifah attempt anything to freshen it
   up.

   <p>The only notable thing about Taxi is Twentieth Century Fox's handling
   of its opening date and advance screenings. The movie was supposed to
   open Friday, but screenings weren't scheduled until Wednesday night to
   keep critics from spreading the bad news too soon. Then Fox figured
   the news would be so bad that it opened the film on Wednesday to
   squeeze out a day or two of ticket sales before Fallon's comedy bits
   hit the pans.

   <p>Here's the kicker: Fox already gave out tickets to free screenings
   Wednesday and tonight that are still planned, so a few hundred people
   will see the movie for free. They're still getting ripped off.
