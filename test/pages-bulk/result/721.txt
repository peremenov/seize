                 <h> The Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter

<h>Software -

   <p>SRIM is a collection of software packages which calculate many
   features of the transport of ions in matter. Typical applications
   include:
     <p>* Ion Stopping and Range in Targets: Most aspects of the energy loss
       of ions in matter are calculated in SRIM,  the Stopping and Range
       of Ions in Matter. SRIM includes quick calculations which produce
       tables of stopping powers, range and straggling distributions for
       any ion at any energy in any elemental target. More elaborate
       calculations include targets with complex multi-layer
       configurations.
     <p>* Ion Implantation: Ion beams are used to modify samples by
       injecting atoms to change the target chemical and electronic
       properties. The ion beam also causes damage to solid targets by
       atom displacement. Most of the kinetic effect s associated with
       the physics of this kind of interactions are found in the SRIM
       package.
     <p>* Sputtering: The ion beam may knock out target atoms, a process
       called ion sputtering. The calculation of sputtering, by any ion
       at any energy, is included in the SRIM package.
     <p>* Ion Transmission: Ion beams can be followed through mixed
       gas/solid target layers, such as occurs in ionization chambers or
       in energy degrader blocks used to reduce ion beam energies.
     <p>* Ion Beam Therapy: Ion beams are widely used in medical therapy,
       especially in radiation oncology. Typical applications are
       included.

<h>Science -

   <p>The science of ion beams goes back almost a century to the earliest
   explanations of radioactive particles transiting thin films (1904).
   The field is so rich that it is difficult for a non-expert to
   understand any of the current papers in the field. But basically,  the
   stopping of ions in matter can not be calculated from first
   principles. Hidden in stopping theories are parameters which normalize
   calculated stopping powers to existing data. The "Science" section of
   SRIM will review the basic theories of the stopping of ions in matter.
   Then some of the major parameters are reviewed and it will be shown
   how they are derived from experimental data. Examples are shell
   corrections, mean ionization potentials, the effective charge of ions
   and the Fermi velocity of solids.


   <p>Over 2000 papers have been published in the experimental stopping of
   ions in solids. Experimental measurements of stopping powers is a
   difficult task, and there is wide variation in the results.. Plots
   will show how existing stopping calculations compare to experimental
   data from these papers.  Since the stopping calculations are based in
   great part on theory, the interpolation of stopping powers between
   various ions and targets is often more accurate than individual
   measurements, especially for difficult targets.

                     <h>Effects of Terrestrial Cosmic Rays



   <p>Although this subject is more about the effects of energetic hadrons
   on terrestrial electronics than about ion beams, it is scientifically
   in a similar field (hadrons = protons, neutrons and pions, i.e.
   particles which respond to the nuclear force / strong interaction).
   The science and technology about cosmic ray induced soft fails was
   considered proprietary by IBM for more than 15 years. In 1996, a
   complete issue of the IBM Journal of Research and Development was
   devoted to reviewing this work. A summary of the issue, and the
   complete first article (the 15 year history of the development of the
   IBM scientific understanding of soft fails from radiation) is given at
   <p>IBM J. R.& D.


   <p>The scientific history of  this field is reviewed in detail. The field
   is not static because the technology of integrated circuits is still
   rapidly changing and the effects of cosmic rays on integrated circuits
   (ICs) show trends which are not well understood. The trends in the
   sensitivity of ICs to cosmic rays are reviewed for SRAMs, DRAMs and
   logic over the last 15 years.


   <p>Fundamental to any estimates of the fail rate of ICs is an
   understanding of the ambient flux of cosmic rays in the environment.
   As this flux has been investigated over the last 15 years, it has
   become fuzzier rather than more precise. Previous measurements of the
   ambient flux which were considered reliable have been shown to be
   suspect. New measurements rarely agree with past measurements. Recent
   reports of the flux of sea level cosmic ray hadrons vary by more than
   10x, even though they were performed by highly competent scientists.
   The problem will probably be resolved by understanding that the
   immediate materials nearby an experiment can have significant effect
   on the measured flux. The field of the terrestrial flux of cosmic rays
   will be reviewed.

   

                               

                          <h>Ion Beam Analysis (IBA) 

   <p>This package contains programs for the analysis of data from ion
   scattering experiments (called Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy,
   RBS), and analysis of data from target sputtering experiments (called
   Elastic Recoil Detection, ERD). In general, the package is applicable
   to any ion, at any energy in any target material. It is written in a
   windows-based environment with a full graphics user interface (GUI)
   for analysis of complex spectra using mouse-based input. The software
   contains a full 32-bit instruction set to minimize computer delay in
   calculating simulations.

   <p>The software is written in a language called APL, which is a
   multi-window GUI application language particularly forgiving of
   mistakes. Since IBA analysis is so complex, and covers any ion at any
   energy for any target, it is particularly difficult to ma ke a program
   which will not get confused by user requests. APL allows the user to
   immediately recover with just two key strokes, without reloading any
   code or data, and continue executing the analysis from the point of
   error. The required APL compiler is available for both Win-95 and OS/2
   systems (see the Installation Manual for details). For details on the
   APL environment for scientific programming, see the website:
   http://www.software.ibm.com/ad/apl/apl2.html. The APL compiler is
   normally very expensive (about $1500) but it is available with
   "educational discounts" from IBM sales. The software requires the full
   APL package and will not work with any of the stripped down versions
   of APL.


   <p>The package has been used by many groups and is relatively bug-free.
   However, this software is no longer supported by the author.


   <p>Below are links to (a) an Introduction to the IBA software, (b)
   Installation requirements for the software, and (c) Samples of IBA
   applications. The sample IBA figures show some of the capabilities of
   the IBA package. These figures come from the IBA Tutorial Manual.

   


   <p>To obtain the IBA software package, you must download and print out
   the Installation Manual (in MS-WORD format) for your system, and then
   the Application Package, which is one ZIP file which contains both the
   Win-95 and OS/2 programs (the differences are minor). The application
   package also contains the Tutorial Manual which you will print out as
   part of the installation process.


   <p>Once you have installed the system, the Tutorial Manual introduces you
   to the Analysis software, and it can be used for later reference for
   menus for more complex operations such as introducing ion implanted
   distributions into complex layered targets.
