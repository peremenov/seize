   <h>Nie to head new institute studying impact of technology on society

   <h>BY KATHLEEN O'TOOLE

   <p>For the first time in my career, I don't know what to think about what
   is going on," a slightly exasperated Professor Stephen Chaffee admits,
   when asked to summarize the Internet's impact on society. "There is a
   lot of speculation, tons of books and predictions, but when you look
   at the evidence, it's very sketchy."

   <p>Not surprisingly then, Chaffee, a Stanford professor of communication
   who has been tracking the influence of television on politics over 35
   years and is starting to pick up signs of Internet influence, was
   delighted to learn recently that an esteemed social scientist,
   business executive and well-placed high-tech entrepreneur was coming
   to campus for the purpose of tracking "what's going on." He is Norman
   Nie, former chair of the University of Chicago's political science
   department, longtime study director of that university's National
   Opinion Research Center, and co-founder and former chief executive of
   SPSS, one of the world's leading software companies. Nie has traded in
   those roles to direct a new research institute, the Stanford Institute
   for the Quantitative Study of Society (SIQSS). Its central mission is
   to apply survey research data to the analysis of broad social changes,
   especially those prompted by information technology and educational
   attainment.

   <p>"Norman is sincere, and he knows how to do this," Chaffee says.

   <p>"Norman is a very energetic research entrepreneur," adds economics
   Professor Emeritus Victor Fuchs, "and that's good because the question
   of how technology is changing our society is a fascinating one. He is
   also interested in the role of education, and if you think about it
   from one point of view, education and information technology are not
   that far apart. We often confuse the education process with its
   product, and we may be doing the same with this new technology."

   <p>Computer-based information technology might turn out to be as
   influential as Gutenberg's press, which is said to have necessitated
   the creation of nation states and modern warfare, says Chaffee. But
   it's also possible its influence will be more modest, such as that of
   the telegraph, which, along with railroads, brought us "a country
   3,000 miles wide that functions as a single unit," he says. "All we
   know is that every time there has been widespread adoption of a new
   communication technology there have been lots of consequences and that
   adoption of this latest one is coming on really fast."

   <p>So fast that Nie worries the country is missing the boat -- failing to
   collect baseline data on social trends that are the subject of
   widespread speculation. Who hasn't had a conversation lately about how
   technology is changing jobs, family life, community, commerce or
   politics?

   <p>"There is currently no study going on that is capable of tracking the
   social, economic and political consequences of [information
   technology] outside the workplace," Nie said recently between bites of
   leftover cheese and crackers, a make-do lunch on a day crammed with
   appointments. "There just hasn't been the right combination of
   fundraising, scholarship and focus. That's what I've come here to do,
   and to get if off the ground as quickly as possible."

   <p>For Nie, Stanford was a logical location once he resigned his other
   posts. He's an admirer of President Gerhard Casper, who was his
   provost at Chicago; his intellectual friendships here date back to his
   graduate student days in the late 1960s; the campus is closer to his
   home in Sun Valley, Idaho, than was Chicago; and his Encina Commons
   office is, of course, in the heart of the Silicon Valley, information
   technology's home base. "I think it's just fascinating that with all
   the money generated by the IT industry and all their belief, if you
   listen to their advertising, that they are revolutionizing work and
   social life, that there have been so few, if any, quality studies of
   these phenomena funded by the high-tech industry," he says.

   <p>The industry often paints a glowing portrait of information
   technology, calling the Internet in particular a tool for greater
   democracy, freedom, social connectivity and financial opportunity.
   Perhaps the industry doesn't want studies that might find some holes
   in that picture, a reporter suggests to Nie, who immediately shakes
   his head.

   <p>"The gentlemen who sit out on Sand Hill Road and the founders of the
   companies they sponsor very much should want to know the social impact
   of what they are doing," he says. Besides, he points out, bad research
   projects will be done on a shoestring and, in the absence of quality
   studies, will unduly influence public opinion.

   <p>Take, for example, the study on the "Internet blues" that made
   front-page headlines in late August. Nie grimaces at the mere mention
   of that study's primary finding: Too much Internet surfing makes
   people depressed.

   <p>"Here's a study that starts with a group of people, follows them for a
   few months, measures their use of the Internet and their level of
   depression, and shows that as their Internet use increases their
   depression increases, and they conclude that the causal arrow goes
   from Internet usage to depression. Now, would you be surprised to know
   that depressed people also watch more television than non-depressed
   people? I'd simply say it was interesting, but it doesn't tell you the
   causal direction."

   <p>Quality studies are being conducted on the effects of computers in the
   workplace and on firms, Nie says. "What is missing is a systematic
   approach to how information technology affects the boundaries between
   work and family life, how it affects the very concept of collegiality
   and informal face-to-face relations. One of the ways to view this
   technology is as a wonderful communications and consumer tool. Another
   way is to look at it as the latest step in the long chain of the
   crisis of modernity, which is a series of technological changes that
   remove people further and further from the supporting ligatures and
   interpersonal communities of first the village and neighborhood, the
   extended family, then the nuclear family, and now the broken nuclear
   family."

   <p>Nie's interest in these subjects dates back to his undergraduate days
   at George Washington University in St. Louis, where he was the
   "favorite" student of Ken Prewitt, today's U.S. Census director,
   recalls Gabriel Almond, Stanford professor emeritus of political
   science. Prewitt recommended him to Stanford for graduate work, where
   Nie turned out to be "statistically extremely sophisticated and with
   an early ambition to specialize in quantitative research," Almond
   says.

   <p>"I was one of Sid Verba's research assistants here at Stanford," Nie
   reminisces, "and we were working on citizen participation. We had this
   flood of data coming in from hour-and-a-half-long interviews from
   eight countries of every continent. . . . I knew that the then-current
   tabulation equipment -- counter sorters and plugboard machines -- were
   simply not up to it."

   <p>So Nie built a "boxcar inside a shoebox," writing computer code for a
   7090 mainframe of the mid-1960s that permitted the researchers to
   manipulate their data with sophisticated statistical techniques.
   Today, the follow-on development of that code is the leading research
   tool for university social scientists as well as marketing and polling
   organizations. But as a student in 1968 and for years afterward, Nie
   says, "I had no idea that it would be commercially viable. Timing in
   life is a lot of the story."

   <p>If Nie has his way, the Stanford Institute for the Quantitative Study
   of Society will draw researchers from across campus who will turn
   those tools loose on new data. He wants them to have access to
   systematic surveys of random, representative cross-sections of
   Americans in order to see emerging patterns. Raising the financial
   resources for ongoing surveys is one of his paramount tasks as
   director. Besides Fuchs and Chaffee, other faculty who have become
   involved in the institute include political scientists David Brady,
   Doug Rivers, David Epstein and Shanto Iyengar, and visiting professor
   Sharyn O'Halloran.

   <p>"We are funding small projects by individual faculty members with
   grants of $5,000," Nie says, adding that he soon will announce a
   program of $25,000 grants for larger studies of social change. "There
   are no good one-man-band institutes," he says, explaining why the
   institute is also hosting faculty seminars and a public lecture
   series.

   <p>Nie also wants to study the impact of formal schooling on society. He
   is among a growing number of social scientists who question the
   reigning paradigm about the ever-increasing returns to education.
   Education, or more specifically, years of schooling, has proved to be
   the best predictor social scientists have been able to isolate for
   success in life.

   <p>"If you read the literature in all the social science disciplines on
   education -- education and citizenship, education and earnings,
   education and belonging -- you see arguments for a predominantly human
   capital model of education's role: the more education, the better," he
   says.

   <p>But you also will see that as authors work with later 20th century
   data in industrialized countries, they increasingly make arguments for
   exceptions to maintain the premise. "They will say, 'Well, income
   would have continued to go up except for this,' or 'Citizen engagement
   would have gone up except for the contravening forces of television or
   the death of political parties.' I think we have rushed far too far
   with this notion that education produces better citizenship, more
   income for everybody, a better occupational structure, more
   organizational engagement. Its effects seem to vary from outcome to
   outcome enormously."

   <p>Take the conventional wisdom that a college degree leads to community
   influence and political participation, a subject that Nie and two
   co-authors addressed in their prize-winning 1996 book, Education and
   Democratic Citizenship in America.

   <p>"If it took a B.A. degree 25 years ago to get you in the front seat of
   the town meeting through your occupational profile or your position in
   the community and your inevitable leadership in organizational
   networks, what does it take today?" Nie asks. "Certainly, a B.A. puts
   you nowhere near the front of the ongoing town meeting, and that says
   to me that power and influence is not easily expandable. It may take
   long periods of time and great social invention to expand them. I
   mean, you can multiply by 1,000 the number of messages that citizens
   send to their government, but you can't multiply by anything like
   1,000 the number of messages that the government can respond to."

   <p>There are also "anomalies in the system" that purports to tells the
   economic story, he says. "We rank last among industrialized societies
   in terms of the quantitative knowledge we produce in our college and
   high school graduates, for example, but the Silicon Valley is not in
   Germany; it's right here." One possibility, Nie says, it that the late
   Harvard economist Fred Hirsch was right when he observed that "more
   education for everybody leaves everybody in the same place." Sometimes
   education is more of a "sorting machine" than a creator of human
   capital, he says, but to figure out when education is most worthwhile
   requires data that the census and other national databases don't
   gather, such as where Americans went to school and what they majored
   in.

   <p>Not everyone involved in the institute has the same concerns as Nie,
   he and others say, but they see value in the joint enterprise. "The
   social sciences have taken the road to balkanization about as far as
   it can go," Nie says. "I count every day when I go into one of these
   seminars or meetings how many disciplines we've managed to bring out."

   <p>Whatever the outcome of these long-range studies, it's evident that
   Stanford is the right place for Nie, since his life is inextricably
   linked both to education and the study of information technology.
   Caught in Palo Alto pre-lunch traffic on the day he was interviewed
   for this story, he used his cell phone several times to escape the
   consequences of missed appointments, and he synced his personal
   digital assistant with his computer so he could continue to conduct
   institute business from a remote location -- a hospital, where he
   planned to welcome his first grandchild in person. "You can do an
   awful lot of things on the net," he explained, between sips of Diet
   Coke, "but you can't look someone in the eye, you can't shake their
   hand and you certainly can't give them a hug and a kiss." SR
