  <h> Thoughts on Medical School Interviews II

  <h> by Scott Parazynski BS '83 Stanford University

  <p> Here are some thoughts on interviewing from my experience as an
   interviewee, Advising Associate, Residence Assistant, Freshman Premed
   Advisor, UAC Premed Advisor, and a member of Stanford Medical School's
   Committee on Admissions. Be aware that each interview and interviewer
   is different and, as such, these notes should not be taken as the
   "golden rule". You should speak to as many advisors, med students &
   fellow applicants as soon as possible to get their insights on
   interviewing.

     <p>"There is within medicine, somewhere beneath the pessimism and
     discouragement resulting from the disarray of the health-care
     system and its stupendous cost, an undercurrent of almost
     outrageous optimism about what may lie ahead for the treatment of
     human disease if we can only keep learning." - Lewis Thomas, The
     Medusa and the Snail

   <h>"Just what is the medical school interview?"

   <p>The medical school interview (MSI) brings the applicant's numbers and
   essays to life and, with adequate preparation, can really boost an
   application. Though MCAT scores and GPAs are a mediocre index of how
   well a person might do in med school and decides whether an applicant
   is granted an MSI, they offer nothing to assess personality or
   suitability for a career in medicine. With decreasing importance of
   the MCAT at many schools and a strong desire by medical schools to
   train compassionate physicians, the MSI has a central role in
   admissions.

   <p>Being selected for a MSI is a significant achievement in itself. The
   admissions process essentially involves reducing a large applicant
   pool to a relatively small number of competitive applicants. The MSI
   is an imperfect means of selecting the best potential MDs from among
   this group. Basically, the MSI is designed to substantiate your
   application by subjectively evaluating your compatibility with the
   school and motivations for pursuing an MD. Also, time is allowed for a
   question/answer period about the school itself. This is quite a
   difficult task in an interview that lasts only 20 minutes!

   <h>"Is there any way to prepare for the 3rd degree?"

   <p>Time spent in preparation for the MSI is time well-spent. The
   admissions panel will place a great deal of importance on your
   interview report, and confidence going into the MSI is essential. You
   don't need to spend hours preparing answers to "standard" MSI
   questions, but you should review the most commonly asked interview
   questions.

   <p>Unfortunately, MSI questions can come in an infinite number of forms.
   The solution: "study" the basics. Although there are no standard MSI
   questions, certain general topics invariably come up: your college,
   work and extracurricular experiences; your motivation for becoming a
   physician; and your "uniqueness". Read and re-read your AMCAS Personal
   Statement and other essays. Be prepared to talk in further detail
   about anything mentioned in your application. Go back and study your
   notes and any publications you might have from research projects;
   re-read your best history paper, the article you wrote for The Daily,
   etc.

   <p>Think back on your various extracurricular pursuits. What did they
   mean to you and how did they influence your motivation to become a
   physician? Really think about why you want to go to medical school.
   What do you hope to accomplish and contribute to medicine? How do you
   know what being an MD is like? Think about your strengths and
   weaknesses, likes and dislikes. If you're a junior researcher, why
   aren't you pursuing just a Ph.D.? Where is your research going and
   what would you do next? Be aware of any new developments in your
   application which you may want to bring up at the MSI: any recent
   awards or achievements? You might mention other activities unrelated
   to medicine: current volunteer tutoring, athletic participation, a
   musical performance or an interesting trip for spring break is worth
   discussing and could liven a stalled MSI. These are just guidelines to
   "organize" your brain; the best preparation is to know yourself and to
   have solid reasons for seeking an MD.

   <p>The admissions panel will certainly want to know why you're applying
   to their school. Therefore, research the school thoroughly before
   going for your MSI. Read the school's catalog and review the Stanford
   "red Books" (surveys of Stanford graduates attending med schools). Use
   this information wisely during the question/answer period of your MSI.
   Construct insightful questions about the medical school program. Well
   thought-out questions demonstrate that you have researched their
   program and are enthusiastic about the school. Don't ask about their
   grading system or vacation schedule; this is blatantly obvious in
   their catalog. "What are the opportunities for early clinical
   experiences during my freshman year?" "Is it possible to obtain
   teaching experience during the basic sciences curriculum?" are
   examples of appropriate questions.

   <p>In addition, a general knowledge of trends in medicine and the
   goings-on in the world make for interesting conversation. Topics such
   as in-vitro fertilization, abortion, euthanasia, socialized medicine,
   the AIDS epidemic and the high costs of medicine are often brought up
   as an exercise in current awareness and logical thought. When
   discussing such topics, substantiate what you believe with what you
   know. Try not to get defensive. There are no right or wrong answers.
   Think about how you would try to address the issues.

   <p>Take notes on your MSI "performances": what went well, what went
   wrong? This strategy will help you improve subsequent MSI performance.
   You should also plan to re-read your entire application to a school
   the night before your MSI, just to refresh your memory. To come across
   well at the MSI, you need to express yourself well: be concise and
   articulate. Learning to relax with difficult questions is important in
   handling the stress of an MSI.

   <p>As a final preparation before your interview, schedule a mock
   interview at the UAC - this is a great opportunity for immediate
   feedback! All of this preparation will build your confidence and help
   you to present yourself succinctly regardless of the questions asked.

   <h>"What's going to happen to me?"

   <p>Nightmares abound regarding stressful interviews and you've likely
   heard the rumors. From my experience and common consensus,
   pressure-type interviews are far less common than the "laid-back,
   Californian" variety. Granted, the MSI is an anxiety-ridden experience
   and some form of self-imposed stress reaction is normal. Fortunately,
   the process gets much easier with experience and, by your 3rd or 4th
   MSI, you may find yourself more relaxed than your interviewer!
   Remember that most interviewers are volunteers for the job and as
   such: a) usually enjoy meeting people and interviewing; b) were all
   once in your shoes; and c) don't bite (usually).

   <p>In the unfortunate event that you run into someone who asks you to
   open a nailed-shut office window, keep your composure and play along
   with it. If dealing with the former, stick with your answer and
   substantiate it. If a question seems vague or offensive, don't
   immediately jump in without thinking. Try to clarify what's being
   asked and to pin the interviewer down to a specific question. If this
   doesn't work, punt: "Well, that's a very interesting question. I'd
   have to think about that for a while."

   <p>Interview formats vary from school to school. Prior to your interview
   trip, talk with medical students, your advisors and friends who have
   interviewed at the school to get details. On the average, you will
   receive 2 one-on-one interviews, often one with a faculty member and
   one with a medical student. Other varieties do exist with multiple
   interviewers or multiple interviewees. Interviews may be "blind",
   where the interviewer has not yet read your file, or they may be based
   on a thorough review. There are advantages and disadvantages to each.
   In a blind interview you may not have to explain your C- in Weed Out
   Chemistry 101, but you're more likely to have to tell your complete
   life story to a stranger. In a reviewed MSI, often the interviewer has
   been selected for you based on common academic interests (a molecular
   biologist for an undergrad biochemistry researcher, for example). This
   underscores the need for complete honesty and avoidance of
   exaggeration. The interviewer probably knows more about your specialty
   than you, and half truths really stand out.

   <p>Another point about MSIs is that they often don't take the full
   scheduled time allotment (generally 1 hour). MSIs can be as short as
   20 minutes to longer than 2 hours. Note: the length of an interview is
   not a reliable indicator of how well or how poorly an MSI went: it's
   the content that matters.

   <h>"Who are they looking for?"

   <p>The MSI is designed to fill the gaps in your personal statement: are
   you charismatic, enthusiastic, friendly and warm? The MSI also serves
   to assess communication skills: do you have fluid and articulate
   speech? Medical schools are also looking for people who are oriented
   to the school's strong programs: a researcher-type might have a
   tougher time gaining acceptance to a school that primarily trains
   Family Practitioners and vice versa.

   <p>Interviewers like to see an applicant who follows what's going on in
   the world, not someone buried completely under books. They want
   students with a well-founded desire to practice medicine and students
   enthusiastic about their school. They will probe your involvement in
   extracurricular activities and research, and expect thorough
   knowledge. You should stress the independent work and creativity that
   went into your projects. What thought process, critical decisions and
   judgment went into your experimentation? No one wants to hear the
   details of how to pour an agarose gel.

   <p>Express your thoughts, not what you think the interviewer wants to
   hear. Also realize that your interviewer will ask you two basic types
   of questions: those that you're expected to know and those that are
   geared to test your comprehension and analytical abilities. You aren't
   expected to know everything, so don't be afraid to say, "I don't
   know". It's often looked upon very favorably when a student has the
   courage to admit this. Don't bluff or give a hand-waving explanation
   this is easy to spot. Finally, you may be asked how you rank their
   school: be honest. If it's your number one choice, by all means tell
   them. If not, state enthusiastically that you are strongly considering
   them (otherwise you'd be wasting your time and money), but that you
   haven't finished visiting/interviewing at all schools yet.

   <p>(About controversial issues: these can be a problem for female
   applicants. Topics like pregnancy, raising children, marriage, etc.
   are taboo, but might be asked. Keep your cool and answer honestly.
   Unfortunately, if you want to get into that school, you'll have to be
   cautious about protesting. But, if the MSI went badly, you can defend
   yourself in a letter to the Director of Admissions stating what was
   unfair. This tactic might go in your favor and you could get another
   MSI.)

   <h>"Emily Post's MSI Etiquette"

   <p>Honesty, humility, enthusiasm and humor (within reason; play it by
   ear) are your best bets for a successful interview.

   <p>Remember not to sell yourself short - go into the MSI believing you're
   a very special person who could "do their school proud". If you don't
   toot your horn, no one else will. Just do it in moderation. You need
   to walk the fine line between humility and conceit to get your best
   attributes across to your interviewer. Conversely, be aware of your
   weak points as these may also come up in the discussion. I realize
   that Stanford students have few weaknesses, but it's important to have
   identified a few beforehand. Typical responses like "I tend to get
   involved in too many activities, but I never let my performance be
   compromised" are overused. You can do better - just add a positive
   note.

   <p>Relax and, if possible, enjoy your interview. Interviewers are
   genuinely interested in meeting and making next year's class a strong
   one, so generalized terror probably isn't warranted. Try to express a
   confident and positive attitude.

   <p>If you are shy, it may take longer than the allotted time to get
   things rolling. Monosyllabic responses and lack of enthusiasm are not
   exciting conversation. This perception may carry over to your
   evaluation. Practice making strong first impressions when meeting
   people. Schedule a mock interview at UAC to reinforce this. You need
   to come across as a warm and sensitive person with excellent
   potential.

   <p>A word of caution: try not to monopolize the interview or get too
   verbose. This leaves a very negative impression. If an interviewer
   gets on a tangent and you feel that you haven't quite touched on all
   the major bases it's OK to tactfully and cautiously guide the
   interview in a more productive direction. As for physical appearance,
   applicants stick out in their pressed blue blazers and conservative
   dresses among the faded jeans and unshaven faces of the local med
   students (and even their interviewers on occasion). Nonetheless,
   professional and conservative dress is strongly recommended, as it is
   a token of respect and reflects a serious attitude. You might argue
   that you have a right to "express yourself" through your clothing, but
   why risk it? You should dress so that the interviewer won't think
   about your attire but about you. This translates to a 3-piece suit or
   jacket and tie for men, a business-type dress for women.

   <p>You should think about your body language and how this may affect your
   interviewer. Specifically, try not to fidget or tap your feet.
   Nervousness is normal; try to quell this with an occasional deep
   breath. Don't stare outside or at the clock. Express interest in what
   both of you are saying by leaning slightly forward and keeping eye
   contact with your interviewer.

   <p>One last word of advice on MSI etiquette: don't take the medical
   student interview too lightly. Their reports carry just as much clout
   as a faculty MSI. Therefore, don't be cocky or confide something to a
   student that you would never say to a professor. Remember that student
   and faculty are working together and you might get burned.

   <h>"Fun facts to know & tell about MSI scheduling"

   <p>MSI's are usually by invitation only. The Admissions Committee reviews
   your GPA, MCAT scores, personal statement, secondary application and
   letters of recommendation, and then somehow decides whom to interview
   (See Ruby and Nancy on how to go about getting one). The percentage of
   applicants interviewed depends on the particular school - often only a
   small fraction are granted an MSI. Once you've been granted an
   interview, pat yourself on the back and/or congratulate yourself in
   some fashion. You've made the big cut and are one of a few highly
   competitive applicants being considered. Often a school will assign
   you a date and time that may be difficult to accommodate, especially
   if on the east coast. Generally, the Admissions Staff is flexible and
   will arrange another date as need be.

   <p>If you haven't heard from a school but will be "in the neighborhood"
   on the opposite coast, it is acceptable to call or write a school well
   in advance of your trip to request an MSI. Give the school at least
   3-4 weeks leeway, the dates of your trip and a polite letter. It's OK
   to call if you haven't gotten a response in a couple of weeks. It
   isn't OK, however, to walk up to their doorstep and request an
   interview on the spot.

   <p>This is a serious MSI faux pas. If you have been rejected from a
   school but think your application is competitive (be realistic), you
   may appeal the decision and ask for a review of your record. After
   all, you have nothing to lose and at best will get an interview.

   <p>Some schools will offer a regional MSI; there is no known disadvantage
   with respect to admission by opting for a regional. Some say that
   having a local MSI may show a greater interest in a school, but
   committees are cognizant of financial constraints. If accepted and/or
   highly considering a school, check it out first before accepting a
   spot there.

   <p>You're probably asking, "How can I afford a deluxe MSI vacation?"
   Ticketing as far in advance as possible helps lower travel costs. Try
   to group schools regionally to save time and money; if you've arranged
   a group of 2 or more east coast schools, you can get special fares
   with unlimited travel for 21 days (try Continental and American). This
   often takes several phone calls back and forth to the admissions
   offices to juggle interview dates. 5-Star accommodations can often be
   arranged with a local medical student or in the medical school
   dormitory for a reasonable price (this is also a great way to meet the
   "locals"); call the admissions office for details.

   <p>One final thought: the interviewing "season" often extends until May.
   Generally, the earlier you complete your AMCAS and secondary
   applications, the earlier your file is reviewed for interview. Later
   in the season, the offices become backlogged and you may have to wait
   in limbo longer. Apply early!

   <h>"What do I get in return?"

   <p>You may receive some feedback with respect to your chances for
   acceptance. Don't read too deeply into your interviewer's comments or
   the atmosphere of your discussion, however. Remember that the comment,
   "I hope to see you here next year" is only coming from one member of
   the admissions panel. Conversely, a perceived "bad" interview may
   reflect the interviewer's personality, and s/he may have been
   expressionlessly but thoroughly impressed by you. Moreover, one
   marginal MSI may be entirely negated by another excellent one. My
   advice: think positive and cross your fingers.

   <p>You will definitely have the opportunity to discover lots of
   information about the school and its environs (elicited by your
   insightful questions as discussed above, remember?). Take a tour or,
   if your MSI is regional, plan on seeing the school well before
   enrolling. Talk to as many students as possible and inquire about the
   overall quality of lectures and clinical education. Do senior medical
   students think they received a quality education? Also, try to assess
   the quality of life, the climate, your prospective peers and the
   cultural/recreational activities available. Think about your family
   and friend support network - how would it change? Is this important?
   How would you, individually, fit into the medical school?

   <p>This will be the time to get info on financial aid, student housing,
   Nat'l. Board Scores and the Nat'l. Residency Matching Program. Visit
   the financial aid and housing offices, time permitting. Applicants
   tend to focus on board scores and the percentage of school's seniors
   matching their top choice for residency training. A few words of
   caution on each: some lesser schools gear their teaching toward
   performance on the Nat'l. Boards (rather than the art of medicine). As
   such, their students score much higher than normal. Remember that your
   patients won't have a 3 x 5 index card on their forehead with labeled
   options. As for claims like: "90% of our graduating class matched
   their top 3 choices", regard such statements with a certain amount of
   skepticism as well. The Residency Matching Program works with a
   self-selected applicant pool: a C+ student from Granada Medical School
   won't apply for training in neurosurgery at Massachusetts General
   Hospital.

   <h>"What happens next?" i.e. The Wheel of Fortune

   <p>Somehow all of the information at the Committee's disposal goes into a
   black box - the committee meeting - and emerges as accepted, wait list
   and rejected candidates. Often the decisions that are made seem
   arbitrary and nonsensical. I couldn't even attempt to describe or
   unravel the mysteries of the panel as they vary from school to school
   and year to year. All I can say is that a strong interview can really
   boost even a marginal applicant to an accepted spot. Give it your best
   shot.

   <p>A sincere follow-up thank you note to an interviewer is fine if you
   really enjoyed the conversation and if you have a strong interest in
   their school. Don't write if the MSI was only marginal, as this may
   appear like begging. Sit back and wait for the Committee's decision.
