   <h>Self-Parody Answers

   <p>For those who care (and to prove that I aten't ded), the answers to
   last weekend's silly post:
     <p>* 1) Ee do bay bup, Ee do bay ba bup, Novo, Bay lup. "Under
       Pressure" by Queen and David Bowie Freddie Mercury is so cool he
       doesn't need real words.
     <p>* 2) Sha la la la la, yeah. Uh-huh, yeah. "Mr. Jones," by Counting
       Crows Adam Duritz imitates Van Morrison.
     <p>* 3) Ding-a-ling-a-ling, Ding-a-ling-a-ling ding. "Jackie Wilson
       Said," by Van Morrison The opening riff would be better, but I'm
       too lazy to transcribe it myself.
     <p>* 4) Na-na na-na na-na na-na-na na na-na na-na na-na na-na-na. "All
       the Small Things" by Blink-182 Yes, I'm a little old to listen to
       skate punk music. Bite me.
     <p>* 5) Ba duba dop ba do bop, Ba duba dop ba do. Oh yeah. "Mmmm Bop"
       by Hanson This is the one I don't actually own. But it's hard to
       beat for nonsense lyrics.

   <p>And that's about enough of that.

   <h>Press Release

   <p>We interrupt our struggling with graphics file formats (I love LaTeX
   for text, but getting figures into it is always a damn nightmare) to
   bring you this Important Announcement:

     <p>The Deppeller family (Don Deppeller, Toni Jannelli and Louise
     White) had made claims that they had been harassed and kept under
     surveillance because of their awareness of highly-classified US
     govât. projects, and in a remarkable turn of events, their claims
     were actually corroborated by one of Americaâs top scientists who
     worked on these projects. â one Dr. Dan Burisch, Phd.,
     H-6196-Maj-E-(ret.), who admitted to certain facts that have been
     withheld from the public for over fifty years.

   <p>Now, you might be the tiniest bit skeptical about these claims, given
   that the site linked is just a post-your-own-press-release service.
   But just look at these revelations:

     <p>In a body of nine facts, and an accompanying transcripted
     conversation, Dr. Burisch states that yes, as a retired scientist
     who previously worked for Majestic 12 as badge #H-6196-Maj-E(ret.)
     that worked on the very important projects "Preserve Destiny",
     "Aquarius", "Lotus", and "Preserve Mother", he was at the center of
     efforts to help protect Earth and humanity under the shadow of a
     Catastrophe that will allegedly occur "in the 2012 time frame",
     that yes he was made aware by co-workers in Majestic of the
     surveillance of the Deppeller family home in Washington, DC, and
     that indeed there is a treaty between present human authorities and
     extraterrestrial peoples called the "Tau-9 Conference for the
     Preservation of Humanity".

   <p>Hey, if you had someone to swear to this information, you'd do a press
   release, too. Of course, many of my readers would probably headline it
   "Retired Nutbar Will Sign Anything," but, you know, it's, um, news.

   <p>You might be saying "Well, this sounds fascinating, but where are the
   details? What were these interestingly-named projects about?" I've got
   your details right here:

     <p>Dr Burisch, who as one of the top negotiators for MJ-12 of this
     treaty, also admits to working on the following projects:

     <p>"Project Preserve Destiny", which goes back to before 1960 and
     which is concerned with efforts to prepare at least some segments
     of the human population for the cataclysms expected in the 2012
     time-frame.

     <p>"Project Lotus", which is concerned with developing a model to
     utilize the miraculous Ganesh Particle to heal everything from
     earthly ecosystems to the human body, including cancer.

     <p>"Project Aquarius", which is a Top Secret project that was started
     in 1953 and was set up to accumulate as much data as possible about
     alien life forms and to distribute the collected information to the
     relevant authorities. This included Dr. Burischâs work with one
     EBE, or alien, in helping to find a cure for a neurological
     degradation suffered by it.

     <p>"Project Preserve Mother", which involved the deployment of the
     Ganesh Particles in the polluted waters of Cabrillo Bay outside Los
     Angeles, CA in an effort to clean up the ecosystem there.

   <p>I've long thought that alien particles in the water near Los Angeles
   could explain a lot. At last, I've got evidence to back up my
   irrational prejudices.

   <p>But it gets better-- what was the purpose of the Majestic
   organization, you ask?

     <p>Ever since the formation of MJ-12, this organization has worked to
     arrange funding and distribution of movies, films, television
     series, specials and even commercials that have brought the message
     to the public over the past fifty years that not only are we are
     not alone, there exists the reality that interstellar and time
     travel does occur, that wormholes or âstargatesâ do in fact exist,
     and that there are cataclysmic scenarios that have a basis in
     historic and scientific fact.

   <p>Yes, that's right, space aliens have traveled billions of miles to
   visit Earth and suborn our governments, in order to push schlock
   sci-fi movies and tv shows. It does make a certain amount of sense--
   if you think about it, alien financial backing is as good an
   explanation as any for Event Horizon. If only they'd thrown their
   weight behind Firefly, it might still be on the air...

   <p>How do I know all this, you ask? People send me unsolicited email.

   <p>I think I was happier when they just tried to sell me illicit Chinese
   lasers.

   <h>Maintenance

   <p>I've switched over to full-text RSS feeds. I'm not sure yet what this
   is going to break, but there's bound to be something.

   <p>Apologies if this results in every single post in the last six months
   being marked as new, or whatever.

   <p>Also: Windows Update is the bane of my existence. Can some CS type
   please explain to me why installing security updates for the OS
   requires changing my monitor resolution?

   

   <h>Singles of the Moment

   <p>I bought a bunch of new stuff from iTunes recently, and have set up a
   playlist for songs added in the last 30 days, which the Party Shuffle
   feature has been dealing from for the past week or so, with a few
   other songs mized in here and there. I thought I'd offer a slightly
   more serious pop-culture thread by highlighting some of the tracks
   that are in particularly heavy rotation in Chateau Steelypips at the
   moment.

   <p>I'd provide MP3's of these tracks, but I don't want to get sued.
   Anyway, they're all available from iTunes at a buck apiece, even if
   you're not likely to find them in your local record store.

   <p>"Tiny Spark," by Brendan Benson a chugging guitar riff, heavy layers
   of synthesizers, and rich harmonies (or at least lots of overdubs) on
   the vocals. Power-pop gold. The rest of the album (Lapalco) is pretty
   solid, too.

   <p>"Soft Machine" by By Divine Right. Not only is it a dumb band name,
   they win the Hoppus/ DeLong Award for Most Juvenile Lyric of the Year
   ("I got a non-dairy creamer in my jeans, I'm happy to see you if you
   know what I mean." Yes. We know exactly what you mean. Please stop.).
   Still, it's a ridiculously catchy little fuzzed-out pop song. If the
   Eels decided to play to the frat-boy demographic, this is what it
   would sound like.

   <p>The album is pretty uneven, and I only bought a handful of tracks.
   "The Slap" and "I Can't Do This by Myself" are good, too.

   <p>"Just to See You Smile," by Chuck Prophet. I only bought one track off
   this one, but this song has been in heavy rotation on the "Adult
   Alternative" channel of our digital cable for a good year and a half
   now. A sweet and dopey little song, with the riff behind the chorus
   lifted from "Penny Lane." (Not really, but that's what it reminds me
   of.)

   <p>"Catch My Disease," by Ben Lee. This one's been getting some radio
   airplay-- a silly little toy piano line, nonsensical lyrics, and a
   great pleading chorus. Weirdly, my brain has decided that this is what
   the band fronted by Dominic Monaghan's character on Lost would sound
   like. The rest of the album, not so much, but this song, yes.

   <p>The other highlight from the record (Awake is the New Sleep, which is
   pretty good all around) is "Into the Dark," which sounds just like
   "Hey, Julie" by Fountains of Wayne, only with an Aussie accent.

   <p>"White Russian Galaxy," by the Crimea. Another power-pop gem. I have
   no idea what it's about, but it's hard not to sing along with the
   chorus. The album (Lottery Winners on Acid-- more of an EP really) is
   kind of uneven (there's one song with really dreadful Streets-style
   spoken-word verses), but it's cheap.

   <p>"The Bucket," by Kings of Leon. OK, this isn't all that obscure, as
   it's the first radio single from their new record (Aha Shake
   Heartbreak), but I like it a lot. I can't understand a word the lead
   singer is saying, but it's a great tune. Imagine the best 70's era
   classic rock song in the world being played on the other side of a
   foot-thick concrete wall, and you've got the basic idea.

   <p>"Lockjaw," by the Rugburns. This is available from iTunes as part of a
   different album than the one I have (Taking the World by Donkey, which
   was a gift from my sister). This is a deeply frustrating band. About
   half of the tracks are so ridiculously sophomoric that they make
   Blink-182 look like Bob Dylan, so it'd be tempting to dismiss them as
   just crap. But mixed in with the terrible songs are some really
   excellent little pop songs. This is the best of the lot-- a sweet
   little song about a guy who can't talk to the girl he likes.

   <p>"It Makes No Difference," by Solomon Burke. This is a cover of a song
   by The Band. There aren't a lot of people who can match Levon Helm's
   voice for desperate pleading, but Burke does a good job of it. It's
   off his follow-up to Don't Give Up on Me, which is pretty good on the
   whole, and not as uneven as the previous record.

   <p>"Pickin' It Up," by Hot Hot Heat. Their last record had a couple of
   really good songs and some undistinguished crap, but this one
   (Elevator) is much more solid. If the Strokes gave a damn, they might
   sound this good.

   <p>The other two albums I bought were the new Springsteen (Devils and
   Dust) and the new Al Green (Everything's OK). Both are very good, but
   I haven't listened to them carefully enough to really pull out single
   tracks (the song that cries out to be picked is Green's take on "You
   Are So Beautiful," but that's not really representative, and while he
   does a nice job with it, it's still schmaltz). I may or may not have
   more to say about them later.

   <h>RSS Query

   <p>Patrick at Ad Astra Per Aspera says mean things about me and a bunch
   of other people, over the lack of full-text RSS feeds on our sites.

   <p>I could easily set Blogger to generate full-text RSS feeds, rather
   than the short summaries I've got it doing at the moment. When I set
   it up originally, I opted for the summary format instead, for two
   reasons.

   <p>First, I occasionally post huge long articles about fiddly little
   details of physics things, and it seems impolite to inflict that on
   people reading via RSS aggregators, in the same way that it's sort of
   impolite to put gigantic image files directly on the front page. This
   is probably a non-issue with good RSS readers, as you can configure
   things on your own machine to give you whatever you want, but it still
   seems vaguely rude.

   <p>Beyond that, I like getting comments on my posts (real comments, that
   is, not "Play online poker"), and I think people are more likely to
   comment if they come to the actual site, rather than reading via
   Bloglines or whatever. I base this on the fact that I'm much less
   likely to post or even read the comments on sites offering full-text
   RSS feeds, simply because I can't do it directly from Bloglines. If
   I've already had to open a separate window to read the site, I'm more
   likely to look at the comments as well.

   <p>When you get down to it, though, I'm not really strongly attached to
   either of these positions. It wouldn't cause me much pain to switch
   over to full-text, if that's generally preferable.

   <p>Is there a general Internet consensus on this? I know Scalzi had a
   post on this a while back, but I can't recall what the outcome was,
   and I'm too lazy to look for it. Comments? Suggestions?

   

   <h>Song Lyrics Post, Special Self-Parody Edition

   <p>You know the deal.
     <l>* 1) Ee do bay bup, Ee do bay ba bup, Novo, Bay lup
     <l>* 2) Sha la la la la, yeah. Uh-huh, yeah.
     <l>* 3) Ding-a-ling-a-ling, Ding-a-ling-a-ling ding.

     <l>* 5) Ba duba dop ba do bop, Ba duba dop ba do. Oh yeah.

   <p>(One of these, I don't actually own, but looked up on the Interweb.
   And #1 is a transcription found on a web site-- I'm not sure about the
   last three, um, words (the rest fits well with what I hear), but they
   add a certain something.)

   


  <p> While it is my fervent hope that my employers agree with me about the
   laws of physics, all opinions expressedhere are mine, and mine alone.
   Don't hold my politics against them.

 

  <p> If you use Internet Explorer, and the text to the right cuts off
   abruptly at the end of this column,hit "F11" twice, and you should get
   the rest of it. We apologize for the inconvenience.
