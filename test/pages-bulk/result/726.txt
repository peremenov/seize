     <p>Pink Floyd were among the earliest innovators to use four channel
      sound, and more recently Dark Side of the Moon won many awards,
     including several for engineering, on its way to being one of the
     best-know albums of all time. The author, who engineered these and
    many other sessions for the band, discusses the quadraphonic record
     production, and contrasts it with the presentation of multichannel
                              sound on stage.

   <p>Many years ago, in the earlier part of their career, Pink Floyd had
   been experimenting with a device inscrutably known as the Azimuth
   Coordinator. It was not a magic box for aligning type machine heads as
   the name might suggest but a very glorified term for what we now know
   as a quad pan pot. Its use at live concerts at that time very likely
   inspired considerable audience interest in multichannel sound systems
   and in a mild way may have contributed towards the now booming
   industry of quadraphony. Many groups have recently adopted
   quadraphonic pa systems for live shows, the size and power of which
   seem to be increasing. Quadraphonic record sales are also on the
   increase, despite the indecision both on the part of the public and
   record companies about which of the various systems provide the best
   results and compatibility.
   <p>Practically all non-classical recordings are made
   using close mic techniques in relatively dead studio acoustics and
   later premixed to a stereo master tape. Exactly the same recording
   procedures can apply for a quadraphonic record except that, because
   the master reduction is made to four channels rather than two, the
   multitrack layout must allow an effective distribution of sounds for
   adapting to quad. There are obviously more possible positions in a
   four channel remix, and conflict may arise with track groupings
   organized with stereo on mind. Although Dark Side of the Moon was
   monitored in studios equipped for stereo reproduction, many sections
   were recorded with regard to the eventual quadraphonic reduction, even
   though this took more track space than would have been necessary for
   stereo. For example, the clock sounds for Time were built in an
   imaginary quad picture on to four tracks of the 16 track master. The
   sounds heard on the introduction to Money were also distributed across
   four tracks to enable the spatial shifts of the quad reduction. This
   involved transfer from an edited tape loop on a four track machine to
   the 16 track for subsequent overdubs so that each sound issued from a
   different speaker.

   <p>Merely redistributing the sound for the quad mix, however, is not the
   end of the story. The various quad systems for which the album is
   intended have to be borne in mind. EMI have adopted the SQ system for
   disc issues. As with all matrix systems it has specific limitations.
   For example, if signals are positioned anywhere in the area between
   centre-of-the-roon and center back they are likely to be out of phase
   to some degree when encoded and cut in two disc channels. This results
   in a considerable drop in level, due to the difference channel
   limitations or even a total disappearance of the signal in mono, so
   this has to be avoided wherever possible, although a pan through this
   center area might pass unnoticed since level variations would be less
   objectionable in a moving picture.
   <p>When approaching the quad mix of the album it had to be emphasized
   that the contents should be unchanged musically, but be a `showcase'
   for the quad medium and avoid the more obvious gimmicks of panning
   etc. The requirements were a discrete master for tape systems, and an
   encoded SQ master for disc transfer. It was thought that two separate
   remixes would be the ideal situation, for in that case each system
   could be used o its fullest capabilities without compromise on account
   of the other. However, there might have been such huge differences in
   quad effect between the two that they might have been incompatible
   with each other musically; for example, in the effect of following
   disc and tape cartridge.

   <p>Another considered alternative was to remix to discrete and SQ
   simultaneously. This would have presented a considerable demand on
   machinery, especially as many other tape machines would be in use for
   quad echo delay, automatic double-tracking (a technique using a fast
   delay) and so on. Every edit would then have to be duplicated on both
   systems; crossfades would be a nightmare, needed three four track
   machines and three stereo machines quite apart from the extra time
   involved and the multiplication of lineup procedures. It was
   eventually decided to work with one discrete four track tape and
   monitor it in such a way that assured a reasonable result for both
   systems, in other words bearing in mind the compromises in the
   subsequent two-channel processing. The quad remix room at EMI's Abbey
   Road Studios has the convenient facility to monitor a discrete tape
   passed through a back-to-back SQ encode/decode arrangement, and also
   the stereo result direct from the two matrix channels without
   decoding. Thus, we can monitor discrete, SQ and stereo from just one
   four track tape. An SQ master was to be prepared simply by making a
   copy of the final edited and crusaded four track tape through the SQ
   encoder. This extra generation could be saved if it was felt necessary
   by direct transfer from an advance head four track machine to disc via
   an encoder, although normal practice is to prepare an intermediate two
   channel tape: azimuth and generation difficulties can be overcome by
   careful engineering. Having determined the manner in which the various
   systems could be handled for the reduction, the problem of quad
   positioning arose.
   <p>On the stereo version the basic instrument positions were arrangedas
   in fig. 1 Additional sounds such as synthesizers, extra guitarsand
   backing vocals were spread across the picture in various
   combinationsfor maximum filling out of the music stage. The stereo
   remix was byno means a simple one, many tracks having to be `potted'
   for just a bar or two. The 16 track master itself was derived from an
   earlier 16 (down to nine or ten tracks on the second in some cases) in
   order to make spare tracks available for further overdubs. This did
   not make the quad picture `design' any easier. For instance, the drums
   had been mixed to stereo on the second generation 16 track which,
   owing to SQ limitations, had to be spread from left to front right,
   leaving bass drum and snare center front and tom toms spread in stereo
   across the front of the room. The bass guitar also had to remain
   center front for the sake of the SQ, but this was no great problem as
   bass frequencies have little directional characteristics and the
   harmonics and attack of the instrument are not particularly strong
   here. Guitar was placed rear left and the electric piano rear right.
   <p>The reverberation system used throughout the quad reduction was two
   EMT reverb plates: one was spread across the front channels and one
   across the rear - both fed from the same source. This gave a very full
   `inside the chamber effect' and helped to minimize the `hole in the
   middle of the room' caused by the absence of direct sounds there.
   <p>The piano on The Great Gig in the Sky is a natural
   quad recording made in Abbey Road Studio One (while bass and drums
   were playing simultaneously in Two) using two distant microphones for
   back channel reverberation. The four tracks were simply combined for
   the stereo version.
   <p>In Time the roto-toms (tom-toms tuned by rotating drums on a pivot to
   stretch the head) were spread across the back channels while most of
   the remaining instruments were distributed across the front. The
   recording technique and studio layout for the basic backing tracks
   were nothing especially unusual except that maximum possible
   separation was attempted. Poor separation for a quad remix of this
   type could probe very disturbing. This was no problem in most cases,
   as many instruments were overdubbed rather than laid down on the basic
   track. The Kepex system was used as a noise gate on all the 16 tracks
   for the reduction, and also in the earlier stages to improve
   separation between individual drums on the basic recording. Further
   use of Kepex enabled decay times of various tracks to be altered; the
   heartbeat on the introduction to the album was, in fact, a Kepexed
   bass drum.
  <p> The positioning for quad remix was effected by means of an external
   insertion unit containing sixteen dual-concentric pan pots (front to
   back and left to right). These were then fed into channel faders on
   the mixing console in the normal way. Any movement or panning was
   arranged by patching in external joystick panpots to the appropriate
   tracks and then again returned to channel faders.
   <p> Us and Them is probably the most involved piece
   of quad technique on the album. On the stereo version a vocal line is
   repeated by means of a very long tape echo which moves from the left
   towards the right on each successive repeat. In order to achieve an
   interesting effect in quad, each repeat was returned to a different
   channel which entailed using a different tape system for each repeat
   rather than recycling one signal back through the same system, as one
   would for a normal tape echo or digital loop. In order to do this a
   hookup had to be arranged, with an eight track machine as in fig. 3.

  <p> It will be noted that each repeat involves two record-replay stages.
   This was necessary to attain the length of delay needed for the piece
   and in fact to increase the delay still further the tape speed of the
   machine was lowered. By the time the fourth repeat had arrived about
   four seconds after the original signal it had passed through eight
   stages of tape, so machine and Dolby line up were extremely critical.
   This caused troubles: originally, the record/replay equalization was
   accurately set, as usual, but the relatively slight speed deviation
   meant that, at the changed speed, slight top lift occurred. After
   eight repetitions this became rather unusable. It will also be noticed
   that the repeat from track eight is fed back into the record stage of
   track one so that a further cycle takes place. Thus: fifth repeat
   returns left front, sixth right front and so on. The result is a
   round-and-round-the-room effect. The system is operated below unity
   gain however, and the sixth and seventh repeats are barely audible.
   <p>A similar type of delay is used in Any Color You Like on synthesizers.
   Richard Wright, when overdubbing on to the section, heard the tape
   repeat in earphones, and played in such a way that the result was
   canonic.
   Owing to the sheer complexity of some of the procedures involved in
   the recording of Dark Side, many of the sounds would be impossible to
   reproduce live, even with the most involved equipment. It is for this
   reason that Pink Floyd use a number of prerecorded tapes, reproduced
   in quad on a Teac four track machine, for their concert programs. The
   tape is operated at the mixing desk which is situated within the hall
   in the audience area. One unusual point about the quadraphonic layout
   for Floyd concerts can be seen in fig. 4. Rather than use a
   conventional double stereo set up, ie front left, right front, left
   back and right back, the whole system is rotated 45º. This has many
   advantages over a normal system.
   <p>The main stereo pa is extremely large and powerful (approve 8 kW). To
   set up an equally powerful system at the rear corners of a concert
   hall would be a mammoth task, and very impractical. Even with the
   layout shown, road crews have a hard time humping huge cabinets to the
   sides and back of the hall, especially when the auditorium is on
   several levels. This involves speaker stacks on every level together
   with their associated cables, which have to be kept out of the way of
   the audience.
   <p>It has been found very effective to have the quad output stacks on a
   level somewhat above that of the stage, especially since the system is
   used frequently to simulate movement.
   This applies more especially to the stack behind the stage, of course,
   which in most cases would be drowned by the more powerful independent
   stereo stage pa. The stage quad stack also serves as an aural cue to
   the band, who might otherwise find it difficult to hear the other quad
   channels, which could literally be hundreds of feet away from the
   stage.
   <p>Any attempt to duplicate the quad picture from the recorded version
   would be disastrous. The delay from front to back in a large hall
   could be as much as half a second, and in tight rhythmic sections this
   would be very unpleasant to listen to, quite apart from the band
   finding timekeeping very difficult with their own sound coming back at
   them from al directions with various erratic degrees of delay.
   <p>Thus, the quad system for a live hall has to be
   used in a rather subtle manner, the aim being in this case to add
   impact at relevant points in the piece being performed. In the long
   introduction to Dark Side, the heart beat fades on slowly as the house
   lights dim and synthesizers and voices swirl around the hall. In one
   of the Floyd's old favorites the effect is slightly less subtle: in
   Careful With That Axe Eugene the quad carries no sound at all until
   the famous horrific scream at which every amplifier and speaker is
   driven to its absolute maximum, accompanied by an explosion of flash
   powder behind the stage.
   <p>Any individual instrument carrying a microphone to the mixing console
   can be individually switched into the quad system. This is used to the
   most advantage on quiet passages where the main stereo pa can be
   virtually shut down and the maximum use made of quad pan pots for
   movement.
   <p>With domestic quadraphonic systems, seating position is very
   important. In a concert hall, however, this is not as critical owing
   to the greater distances involved between channels. It is an
   unfortunate fact, however, that some unlucky concert goers have to sit
   directly underneath a quad stack and get themselves deafened - which
   is as good a reason as any for not using the quad too much throughout
   the concert. In the film Earthquake the noise issues from huge
   cabinets at both ends of the theater, and the author was unlucky
   enough to find himself sitting near one of the rear stacks at a
   showing in the West End.
   <p>Pink Floyd have recently used back projected film behind the stage
   with a 35 mm four channel sound track. This has proved very successful
   but problems do arise with run-up-times of up to ten seconds when
   attempting to bring in a sound on a musical cue. Film and multichannel
   sound are now commonplace of course, as in the new Ken Russell picture
   of Tommy and its use of a `quintophonic' system - doubtless an
   indication of things to come.

    <p>Four sides and four quadraphonic systems, this double album released

                     but then quad went and died on us.
