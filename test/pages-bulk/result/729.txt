<h>Operation FrontlineÂ®



   <p>Share Our Strength's Operation Frontline is a nutrition education
   program that fights childhood hunger by teaching families how to make
   healthy and budget-wise food choices.

   <p>Operation Frontline's hands-on classes are taught in the kitchen by
   professional chefs and nutritionists who volunteer to share their
   strength by teaching nutrition, cooking, and budgeting to low-income
   adults and children. The goal of Operation Frontline is to provide a
   long-term solution to hunger and poor nutrition by teaching
   participants how to select, purchase, and prepare healthy low-cost
   food for their families.

   <p>ofl in action Since 1993, Operation Frontline has provided effective
   nutrition education to over 32,000 low-income families facing hunger
   and poor nutrition. Operation Frontline programs are run in 14 states
   across the country in partnership with city-wide social service
   agencies. Local programs provide Operation Frontline's volunteer-led
   classes at after school programs, family support centers, Head Start
   agencies, health clinics, and other community nonprofits.
