     <p>The record Canadian striped bass was caught in Nova Scotia by
     Gordon Strong - Mira River, Cape Breton Co. 1994. It weighted 54.06
     lb.

     <h>Spawning

     <p>In Canada, spawning occurs in May and June in fresh water, usually
     just above the head of tide when sea water warms to 15-18 oC. Eggs
     and milt are released directly into the water column, and after
     about 72 hours fertilized eggs hatch into free-swimming yolk-sac
     larvae. The duration of spawning is brief, lasting about two weeks,
     after which time spent fish return to sea. During summer and fall,
     adult and juvenile fish undertake wide ranging feeding migrations
     along the coast, often traveling several hundred kilometers beyond
     their natal rivers. In late fall Striped Bass ascend the rivers to
     over-winter in fresh water, in order to avoid low lethal marine
     temperatures. Site selection for over-wintering sites appears to be
     unrelated to spawning sites, and may be opportunistic, dependent on
     the geographic location of the fish at the onset of winter. In
     other words, Striped Bass do not necessarily over-winter in their
     spawning rivers. Males generally spawn for the first time at about
     age three or four, females at age four or five

     <p>Five self-sustaining (i.e. spawning) populations of Striped Bass
     are known to have existed in Canadian waters. Four of these were in
     Atlantic Canada, with documented spawning activity on the Northwest
     Miramichi and Saint John rivers in New Brunswick and on the
     Shubenacadie and Annapolis Rivers in Nova Scotia. The fifth
     population spawned in the St. Lawrence River, Québec.
     Self-sustaining Striped Bass populations from the Annapolis, the
     Saint John, and the St. Lawrence rivers are believed to be
     extirpated. ( a wildlife species that no longer exists in the wild
     in Canada, but exists elsewhere in the wild.) There are currently
     only two sites in Atlantic Canada where Striped Bass reproduce, the
     Northwest Miramichi River estuary (this is the Southern Gulf of St.
     Lawrence stock) and the Shubenacadie-Stewiacke River estuary (this
     is the Inner Bay of Fundy stock). These two populations are
     genetically distinct and both are genetically distinct from Striped
     Bass found in US waters (Bradford et al 1999).

     <p>Although Striped Bass still occur widely in Atlantic Canadian
     waters, some of the fish that are present are likely migrants from
     populations that spawn in US waters. The following S-ranks for both
     Nova Scotia and New Brunswick refer to the status of the two
     remaining spawning populations in those provinces, both of which
     are of some conservation concern.

     <p>Currently in New Brunswick, a spawning population of Striped Bass
     exists only in the Northwest Miramichi River, representing the
     northern-most self-sustaining population of Striped Bass in North
     America. The home range of the Miramichi-spawning population
     extends throughout the entire southern Gulf of St Lawrence from
     Percé, Québec to the Margaree River, Nova Scotia. This southern
     Gulf/Miramichi-spawning population remains at low abundance and the
     population has declined from a high of 50,000 spawning fish in 1995
     to about 4,000 during 1998 to 2000 (Douglas et al 2001). This
     population exhibits large annual fluctuations that are attributed
     to overfishing and year-class failures caused by adverse
     environmental conditions (Bradford and Chaput 1997). The commercial
     fishery for Striped Bass was closed in 1996 but they are still
     taken as bycatch in a number of fixed-gear commercial fisheries in
     the Miramichi system. The southern Gulf of St. Lawrence stock has
     persisted, however, in spite of high harvest mortality over many
     decades (Bradford et al 1999).

     <p>There has been no evidence of spawning on the Saint John River
     since 1979; surveys conducted in 1992 and 1994 were unsuccessful in
     collecting eggs, larvae or juveniles (Jessop 1995). Adult Striped
     Bass still occur in the Saint John River and throughout the Bay of
     Fundy, however these are seasonal migrants that originate from
     rivers in the eastern US or from the Shubenacadie River (Bradford
     et al 1999). Habitat degradation and loss is believed responsible
     for the extinction of the Saint John River Striped Bass spawning
     population. Construction of the Mactaquac Dam, with subsequent
     impediment of access to spawning grounds, and unnatural
     fluctuations in water velocity and volume spilled from the dam, is
     considered to be the greatest factor leading to extirpation of the
     spawning population in the Saint John River.

     <p>The Annapolis River spawning stock of Striped Bass is believed to
     be extirpated, since viable spawning activity has not been reliably
     documented since 1976. A remnant population of adult fish greater
     than 20 years of age may still be extant in the Annapolis River, as
     Striped Bass are quite long lived. These fish may spawn but
     survival beyond the egg stage in the Annapolis River is very low or
     negligible (Jessop 1990). The failure of naturally spawned eggs to
     yield viable offspring may be a result of poor water quality or
     alterations to the physical circulation of the estuary, probably
     due to impacts from tidal power development and agricultural runoff
     (Bradford et al 1999).

     <p>The Shubenacadie-Stewiacke population of Striped Bass has not been
     formally assessed, although sampling with icthyoplankton nets and
     beach seines suggests that Striped Bass spawn annually in the
     Shubenacadie - Stewiacke River system (DFO 1999). The spawning,
     rearing and habitat requirements of Shubenacadie Striped Bass have
     been fully determined and their home range is virtually unknown,
     and may extend beyond the Bay of Fundy and the Gulf of Maine to the
     northeastern US. Though limited retention of Striped Bass as
     bycatch from fisheries in the Inner Bay of Fundy is permitted,
     precise levels of exploitation of the Shubenacadie spawning stock
     in Canadian and US waters cannot be determined (Bradford et al
     1999).

     <p>Striped Bass in Prince Edward Island reflects the fact that a
     non-breeding population occurs in the province. Bass occur
     occasionally in a number of Prince Edward Island Rivers, including
     the Hillsborough, Dunk and Morell, where they are often taken as
     bycatch in the Gaspereau fishery. However, as seine sampling in
     Prince Edward Island has failed to demonstrate the presence of
     juvenile bass, the Prince Edward Island Striped Bass population is
     considered to be from external origin, most likely from Miramichi
     spawning stock.

     km (503 mi) away! (22.4 km/day or 14 mi/day)

     <p>§ Surveys show the average striped bass angler on the Annapolis

     the Canadian shores of the canadian Gulf where the striper attracts
     attention as a game fish, anglers visiting the St. John are far
     more interested in salmon.
