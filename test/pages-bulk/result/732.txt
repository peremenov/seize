<h>SPLITTING FILM
   ______________________________________________________________________

   <p>Since many film types were only available from the film manufacturers
   in35mm stock, several submini camera manufacturers designed film
   splittersto allow cutting a smaller strip of film from 35mm stock.
   With a film slitter,you can get some amazing film into your submini,
   such as 2475 recording film,B&W or color infrared film, Tech pan,
   Agfapan 25 and Ektar 25. Sometimes called film slitters -- and NOT to
   be confused with filmSPLICERS -- these devices came in various styles
   to cut different size strips.Some cut a 35mm strip in half to produce
   two 17.5mm strips for cameras thatused that size film. Others would
   cut 16mm strips, 9.5mm strips and even8mm strips. Some of the
   companies that made these slitters were GaMi, Minolta,Yashica, Ricoh,
   Mikroma, Microtec, Acmel, and Varitype. There are undoubtedlymore.
   They basically work the same way. Using razor blades, of some
   type,they cut out smaller strips of film from 35mm film. These items
   are no longerbeing made and are very difficult to find.

   <p>If you prefer an older model, check out theSWAPMEET section of the
   SUBCLUB.

   <p>If you are handy or determined, you might even want to built your own
   slitter.All you need are a few small pieces of wood, a couple of razor
   blades, somebasic tools, a little ingenuity and time.  Here are some
   pictures ofa completed splitter. With this slitter, you place a bulk
   roll of 35mm filmon the part that looks like a black handle. The film
   is pressed down ontothe cutting block and a removeable pressure plate
   is screwed on top. Thenthe film is pulled through the slitter and
   rolled up on the other side. Twopieces of felt on either side of the
   film keep it from getting scratched.

   

   <p>You can use various materials in the construction of your slitter.
   Thedecision on material is up to you.  Wood is normally easier to
   workwith if you just have standard tools, but other materials may
   offer advantages,if you are familiar with them and have the necessary
   tools.  In buildingyour own slitter, one big problem you will come
   across is that the film ismeasured in millimeters, but American
   building materials are normally cutin inches. To complicate matters
   even more, when you add in the razor bladesinbetween the wood blocks,
   the width is increased very slighly, but it canbe enough to through
   off careful measurements. Here are some helpfulmeasurements:
     <l>* 3/8" wood = .375 inches = 9.525mm -- A piece of wood this thick
       will need to be sanded down somewhat to produce the size of the
       Minox film (9.2mm).
     <l>* 5/8" wood = .625 inches = 15.875mm -- A piece of wood this thick
       (plus the added thickness of the razor blade) should be just right
       for 16mm film.
     <l>* 11/16" wood = .6875 inches = 17.4625mm -- A piece of wood this
       thick (plus the added thickness of the razor blade) should be just
       right for 17.5mm film.
     <l>* 1 3/8" wood = 1.375 inches = 34.925mm -- Pieces of wood that total
       to this thickness (plus the added thicknesses of the razor blades)
       should be just right for the total width of the 35mm film.
       <p>If you need just a little extra spacing, pieces of construction
       paper will probably work fine.  If you need a little less spacing,
       sand down the wood with fine sand paper, measuring as you go.

   <p>Here are a few diagrams to use depending on the type and size of film
   youplan to slit.  The diagrams are NOT to scale.
   <p>If you are using 35mm unperforatedfilm.
   <p>If you are using standard 35mm perforatedfilm.
   <p>If you are using 16mm film, regardless ofthe perforations.
   <p>You can see from these diagrams is that if you only use one size of
   filmto slit from (ex. 35mm) and one size of film to slit to (ex. 16mm)
   your jobwill be easier.  If you plan on slitting from different film
   sizes (ex.35mm AND 16mm), or slit to different film sizes (ex. 16mm
   AND 9.5mm) yourwork is more involved.  You will need to make different
   film slittersor make a slitter with different slitting block pieces.
   It's up toyou to decide which is the best route to take.
     _________________________________________________________________

   <p>Before you get started, here are few points to ponder.

   <p>Making a slitter takes time even if you are familiar with hand tools.
    Themeasurements must be precise and the pieces of material are small,
   makingcutting difficult.  It also makes it easy to cut yourself, so
   watchout!

   <p>The more planning you do up front the better your results will be and
   theeasier the job will be.  The plans outlined here are generic plans
   andneed to be modified depending on the type of film you plan to slit,
   the typeof film you want to produce, the type of materials you plan to
   use and thefeatures you want to built into the slitter.  You will
   first need tospend time designing your slitter using these diagrams as
   a starting point. If you have trouble designing your slitter, it's
   best not to buildone yourself.

   <p>The amount of wood used in the project is very small.  Becasue of
   thisyou can probably afford to move up from a soft wood, like pine, to
   a harderwood, like oak.  Your slitter will last longer, but your saws
   and drillbits won't.  Harder woods are trickier to work with.

   <p>The SUBCLUB can assume no responsibility for the success of your
   splitter,nor for any damage you do to yourself or your camera during
   its constructionor use.   In other words, you're on your own.  If you
   have theslightest doubt about building a slitter, you probably
   shouldn't built one.
     _________________________________________________________________

   <p>If you are working with wood, the tools you will need are:
     <l>* electric drill and bits
     <l>* screwdriver
     <l>* hammer
     <l>* sander and sandpaper
     <l>* wood glue
     <l>* C-clamps
     <l>* saw
     <l>* pliers
     <l>* ruler
     <l>* pencil

   <p>The materials you will need will vary depending on size of the slitter
   youmake and the design and features you build into it.
     <l>* wood (see diagram to design and measure your own pieces)
     <l>* screws (flat head will probably work best)
     <l>* bolts (there are several kinds available)
     <l>* wing nuts (to go with the bolts)
     <l>* washers (to go under the wing nuts)
     <l>* felt (available at any fabric store)
     <l>* dowels (depending on your plans)
     <l>* razor blades (many types are available)
