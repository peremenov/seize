   <h>To Scan Or Not To Scan

   <p>This month's responses are provided by Dr. Janet Storella, a
   radiologist who is medical director of GCM-Suburban Imaging in
   Bethesda. GCM-Suburban Imaging is a collaboration between Suburban
   Hospital and the well-established radiology practice of Drs. Groover,
   Christie and Merritt. The Imaging Center is located in the new
   Suburban Outpatient Medical Center at 6420 Rockledge Drive, Bethesda,
   Maryland.

   <p>I'm confused about the different imaging technologies. What is the
   difference between MRI and CT.

   <p>CT (computed axial tomography) uses X-rays to see structures inside
   the body. These X-rays are aimed at a particular area of your body and
   the ones that pass through your body are received on a detector. A
   computer then analyzes this data and "builds" a picture of what is
   inside.

   <p>MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) takes advantage of the natural
   magnetic properties of the tissues in your body. The machine is a
   strong magnet that sends radio waves through the body. The magnetic
   tissues in the body then send a faint radio signal back. The receiver
   collects all those signals and the computer builds a picture of what
   is inside. MRI is not used for screening, only for diagnostic use.

  <p> My friend paid out of her own pocket to have a full body scan. What is
   this exam? What kind of technology is used?

   <p>The exam is full body CT screening. The idea, as in any screening
   exam, is to find disease before it becomes otherwise apparent in
   someone who has no symptoms or problems. Diagnostic CT scanning to
   examine specific parts of the body when there is a problem has been in
   use for decades. But scanning almost the entire body for screening is
   a new concept. Other examples of screening exams that most people are
   familiar with include screening mammography to detect breast tumors
   before they are felt as lumps or the PSA blood test to detect prostate
   cancer.

   <p>Do you recommend full body scans for people who have no symptoms of
   disease. What are the pros and cons.

   <p>Full body CT screening is controversial. The potential benefit is the
   early detection of significant diseases, such as tumors. Most of us
   believe that early detection saves lives -- if we find a tumor while
   it is still small and has not spread, presumably you can be cured.

   <p>The risk is that of radiation exposure. X-rays can cause damage to
   cells in your body. Even at the low doses used for screening exams
   there is a theoretical risk of causing cancer and we do not have exact
   data to estimate that risk. Of course, that risk of radiation exposure
   should be put into perspective and compared with other risks we take
   every day and don't even think about. Would you decline to live in
   Denver because there is a higher background radiation exposure due to
   the elevation?

   <p>There are other potential downsides. An abnormality can be found that
   is due to a benign or inconsequential process, but leads to additional
   testing or even a biopsy. The exam also has its limitations - it can't
   detect every abnormality, and so a normal screening exam doesn't
   absolutely rule out the possibility of cancer or other significant
   disease.

   <p>With all these issues in mind, and after studying what data we have so
   far, the two exams that seem least controversial are cardiac calcium
   scoring to assess the risk of cardiovascular disease and screening CT
   of the lungs in smokers over the age of 50.

  <p> Do I need a doctor's referral? Do I have to pay out of pocket?

   <p>Insurance companies do not pay for these screening exams and so up
   front payment at the time of the exam is expected. Some centers
   require a doctor's referral and others do not. You would have to check
   with a specific center.

  <p> What is virtual colonoscopy? What are the pros and cons? Is it better
   than having regular colonoscopy?

  <p> Virtual colonoscopy is a CT screening exam to look inside the colon
   without having to pass a scope into the colon. It still requires a
   preparation to clean out the bowel and you still need to pump some air
   into the colon. However, the exam itself is more comfortable than
   regular colonoscopy and therefore no sedation is required. An
   advantage of a regular colonoscopy is the ability to perform a biopsy
   of an abnormal area at the same time, but this also adds an additional
   risk of perforation (creating a hole in the colon).

   <p>Don't these different technologies use radiation and isn't that
   dangerous?

   

   <p>What is a PET scan?

  <p> PET scanning is a new imaging test that looks at the metabolic
   activity of tissues. It uses a radio-labelled glucose analog that
   accumulates in tissues with high metabolic rates. The tissue of many
   cancers grows rapidly and have a high metabolic rate even if they are
   small. This is in contrast to CT scanning, which relies on changes in
   size and shape of tissues to recognize abnormalities. This new PET
   technology is very promising and has been approved for use in
   evaluating several tumors including lymphoma, melanoma, lung cancer,
   and colon cancer.
