<h>What is Hoya?

   <p>Hoya is a genus of tropical plants in the Asclepiad family. When one
   thinksof hoyas one usually thinks of the old favourite, Hoya carnosa,
   which isbetter known as "Grandma's Old Fashioned Wax Plant", and lets
   it go at that,assuming that is all there is to it. When curiosity gets
   the better of anovice grower, to the point that he or she orders an
   advertised catalogue,just to learn why anyone would have the nerve to
   advertise a catalogue withonly one plant in it, shock often results
   from learning that Hoya is agenus comprised of around 200 different
   species, plus numerous cultivars.

<h>The History of Hoya

   <p>Hoya was once part of the Apocinaceae family of plants. Robert
   Browncreated Asclepiadaceae in 1810 to accommodate a group of
   Apocinaceae plantswhose characteristics did not fit well into that
   family. He named the newfamily Asclepiadaceae and included in it all
   those former Apocinaceae plantshaving their pollen contained in
   gelatinous masses called pollinia(singular is pollinium). The only
   other group of plants with pollinia arethe Orchids. Asclepiadaceae
   includes the common roadside milkweeds(Asclepias), the popular
   succulent Stapeliads, which look more like cactithan Asclepiads and
   the very interesting Dischidias, whose leaves are oftenshaped like
   pouches and urns and serve as homes for ants. Hoya contains themost
   beautiful flowers in the family.
   <p>Robert Brown was born in Scotland on December 21, 1773. He studied
   medicinein Edinburgh but did not take a medical degree, preferring
   instead tostudy the plants that, at that time, all medical specialists
   depended uponas cures. Despite his lifelong dedication to the study of
   plants, he isbest known today in the scientific community for the
   discovery of"Brownian Movement," which, simplified, is "the motion
   that you see in a liquidcontaining minute suspended solid particles."
   It is only by chance that hoyas are known today by the name Hoya.
   There isstill some controversy over which name, Hoya R.Br. or
   Sperlingia Vahl camefirst. Both names received their first publication
   in 1810 at about thesame time. Some say that Brown's publication
   preceded Vahl's by severaldays and others argue the other way. The
   sides are so divided that there isa movement afoot to instigate formal
   efforts to have the name Hoyaconserved since it is the most widely
   known name. If Vahl's manuscript hadbeen published when it was first
   submitted there is no doubt that Hoyaswould be known as Sperlingias
   today. Sperlingia lost out due to itsauthor's having been hanged for
   treason. His manuscript was not publisheduntil long after his death,
   it is said, because no publisher was willing tohave his name
   associated with that of a traitor.
   <p>Robert Brown named Hoya in honour of his friend and fellow botanist,
   ThomasHoy, who was employed as head gardener by the Duke of
   Northumberland at his estate,Sion House. There is no record of Thomas
   Hoy's ever having grown a Hoya but surely he must have, since his
   employer was an avid collector of rare tropical plants.

<h>The Nature of Hoyas

   <p>We usually think of Hoya as succulent and there are, indeed, a lot
   ofsucculent hoyas, plus many more that have succulent parts, but the
   vastmajority of them are non-succulent. We also usually think of Hoyas
   as vinesbut there are many species with little to no vining
   tendencies. Forplant collectors, there are hoyas for every taste and
   situation. Some aretwining vines; some are woody shrubs; some are
   entirely terrestrial; andsome are epiphytes. There are still others
   that begin life as terrestrialsthen lose all contact with the ground
   and continue life as epiphytes. Manycling to their supports both by
   twining and by adventitious roots, butothers grow as upright shrubs.
   There are a few that begin as upright shrubsbut after becoming several
   feet tall, continue their life as twining vines.Some hoyas are woody;
   others are soft and succulent. Some have woody stalksand succulent
   leaves. Others are thin and wiry with papery leaves.
   <p>Hoya leaves vary in size, texture, colour and venation. In size they
   rangefrom a centimetre in length and from two to four millimetres in
   width (Hoyaengleriana, Hosseus) to 25 cm. by 25 cm. (Hoya latifolia,
   G. Don). Hoyacoriacea, Blume, is said to sometimes have leaves as long
   as two feet inlength. One of the most succulent of the lot, Hoya
   kerrii, Craib, hasperfect valentine shaped leaves, with the notches at
   the apexes of theleaves instead of at the bases. This species has two
   forms, one withglabrous leaves and one with suede textured leaves.
   There are hoyas withalmost perfectly round leaves and others with
   linear leaves (Hoya linearis,Wall. ex. D. Don and Hoya teretifolia,
   Griff. ex Hook. f.). A popularspecies, Hoya shepherdii, Short ex Hook.
   has leaves that look for the worldlike bunches of string beans hanging
   from their stalks. Hoya linearis,Wall. ex D. Don is covered with fine
   downy hair and greatly resemblesmasses of Spanish Moss (Tillandsia
   useneoides) hanging from trees in itsnative habitat. Some Hoya leaves
   are smooth and shiny; some are coveredwith hairs. Some Hoya leaves
   appear to be veinless while others have veryconspicuous veins of a
   lighter or darker colour than the rest of the leaves.Some have leaves
   that are mottled with speckles of silvery white (Hoyacarnosa, R. Br.).
   Some Hoya leaves are smooth and shiny and others arecovered with
   hairs. Some hoyas have leaves that are thin and translucent(Hoya
   coriacea, Blume); some are so thick and succulent that they look
   morelike crassulas than hoyas (Hoya australis subsp. rupicola,
   oramicola andsaniae from Austrailia and Hoya pachyclada from
   Thailand).
   <p>Hoya flowers are just as varied as the leaves, despite the fact that
   all areshaped like five pointed stars. They grow in umbels, usually
   with manyflowers per umbel. Individual flowers range in size from as
   small as fourto five millimetres in diameter (Hoya bilobata, Schltr.)
   to well overthree inches in diameter (Hoya imperialis, Lindl. and H.
   macgillivrayi, F.M. Bailey). The number of flowers per umbel varies
   from one (H. pauciflora,Wight.) to 55 or even more. Hoya coriacea,
   Blume has been known to have as many as 70, each measuring nearly 2
   centimetres in diameter. The singleflowered Hoya pauciflora, Wight
   makes up for its paucity by its flowersize of nearly an inch and a
   half in diameter.
   <p>Just as hoyas vary in size, they also vary in texture, some being
   glabrousand shiny and some being quite hairy. They also vary in
   colour. They comein the purest white, varying shades of pink from
   almost white to rubber-dollor bubble-gum pink, yellowish-pink, yellow,
   green, purple, brownish-red andbrown. There are some that are so dark
   that they are often referred to asblack. Until recently it was thought
   that a true red hoya was not everlikely to appear but recent
   discoveries make that seem possible. One of thetwo clones of Hoya
   mindorensis, Schltr., from the Philippines, which arecurrently in
   circulation, comes very close to being a true red. Blue stilldoes not
   appear to be represented in the Hoya genus.

<h>Hoya Culture

   <p>Hoyas are, for the most part, very easy to grow. They require a
   welldrained soil, warmth and lots of humidity. Many people will tell
   you thatthe temperature must never be allowed to fall below 60 degrees
   F. or go over85 degrees F. I have seen no harm resulting from night
   temperatures of 45degrees F. in winter or 120 degrees F. in daytime
   temperature in summer.Here in north central Georgia, several of us
   have had Hoya shepherdii, Shortex Hook. survive outdoors all winter,
   when we forgot to bring it inside.All of us reported that our plants
   were left in well sheltered areas but,even so, we often have winter
   temperatures below 20 degrees F. Hoyashepherdii is native to the lower
   Himalayas, where freezing does occur sothat explains its hardiness. As
   for temperatures at the other end of thethermometer, we must remember
   that most hoyas are native to the very hottestspots on earth. The
   secret to survival under less than ideal conditionsappears to be
   providing lots of humidity - very near, but not quite, 100%.When it is
   cool, water should only be applied in amounts to prevent leavesfrom
   shrivelling. One Atlanta grower lost most of his hoyas last
   winterbecause the roots got too dry. My Hoya roots were given even
   less water thanhis and mine thrived. We compared notes and concluded
   that the onlydifference between our growing conditions was that the
   humidity in mygreenhouse was near the saturation level. Humidity
   provides summerprotection too. I have seen Hoya leaves burn nearly to
   a crisp in summer,even with exhaust fans running full time and daily
   watering - and with a50% shade cloth covering the roof. I do not use
   exhaust fans in mygreenhouse because I find that mealie bugs are
   sucked in with the breeze. Ihave lots of circulating fans inside and
   maintain humidity near thesaturation point. There's rarely a burned
   leaf. Although many Hoyas willgrow well and make lots of beautiful
   leaves in a centrally heated-airconditioned living room, it is very
   rare that one will bloom in one. If aliving room is the only indoor
   place you have for growing hoyas, if you wantthem to bloom, find a
   place outdoors in summer - under a tree or, betteryet, on a screened
   porch - anywhere that protects them from noonday sun.
   <p>Many Hoyas respond to a bit of lime in the potting mix but most of
   them do better in a very slightly acid compost. Some, being coastal
   dwellers can eventake a bit of salt spray so if you live near the
   ocean in a warn climate,you should have no trouble finding a hoya
   suitable to your conditions. One,Hoya halophila, Schltr., whose name
   means "salt lover," was originallydiscovered growing on the beaches of
   New Guinea and nearby smaller islands.There are many other coastal
   hoyas and many that are found growing,suspended above bayou waters
   from the branches of Mangrove trees. There arealso a large number that
   are native to mountainous areas, some in calcareoussoils and some in
   soils containing granite and shale. Others livesymbiotically with
   ants. In some species, such as Hoya imbricata, Calleryex Decne., one
   of the leaves at each node (which are paired in most Hoyaspecies)
   aborts and the single peltate leaf that remains, flattens
   itselfagainst the trunk of its host tree and clings there, being held
   by numerousnodal roots. Ants build their nests beneath the leaves and
   contribute tothe plant's nourishment. Another species (Hoya darwinii,
   Loher) provides ahome for ants in a different way. For much of its
   life, its leaves looklike normal leaves, but something will trigger
   the growth mechanism andcause the lateral margins of some of its
   leaves to stop growing, while thecentres continue to grow. The result
   is leaves that are rolled up intoball shapes, looking much like green
   golf balls. It isn't known what causesthis but it has been suggested
   that it is caused by the presence of formicacid, a by-product of ants.
   The sheltered golf-ball leaves serve as homesfor ants, whose wastes
   fertilise the host plant and the unsheltered leavescollect rain water
   which is utilised by the host plants during dry periods.Another ant
   lover is the popular miniature, Hoya lacunosa, Blume. Although usually
   grown as a pendulous hanging basket plant in cultivation, in its
   habitat it is a tree climber. It is usually found growing out of
   theground from the center of an ant bed. As it climbs up the trunks of
   nearbytrees, the ants build "dirt-dauber-like" tunnels along its
   stalks, in orderto give their tunnels stability. The ants live inside
   the tunnels andsupply nourishment to the plants. Collectors, in the
   wild, often find, totheir sorrow, that a plant with not a single ant
   in sight will suddenly comealive with vicious ants, when they cut a
   stem and try to dislodge a cutting.The species of ants that occupy
   those tunnels are said to sting like thedickens and leave painful,
   itchy sores with days worth of scratching intheir wake. Not to fear,
   this lovely and very fragrant wee hoya will growvery nicely without
   ants so don't fear growing it.
   <p>The most difficult aspect of growing hoyas is finding correctly
   labelledones. Many people don't care a bit what their hoyas are called
   - or even,if they have names. They grow by God and by guess or pure
   animal instinctand never lose a plant. Others like to learn about
   their plants' nativehabitats and try to match climatic and soil
   conditions to those habitats.That is next to impossible for Hoya
   growers because dealers call plants bywhatever names suit them. It
   does one little good to know that Hoyagriffithii, Hook.f., for
   example, is a native to northern India, Sikkim andNepal, if the plant
   one buys with that label actually came for an island inthe southern
   part of the Solomons, which is exactly where the one I got solabelled
   originated. One grower (no longer in business) once listed over
   200different species names. I bought every single one of them and
   learned, tomy sorrow, that the dealer had only 7 different correctly
   identified speciesand one of those was labeled only half right. All
   the rest were eitherduplicates of those seven with different labels or
   cultivars of them, plus anumber of unidentified numbered species.

<h>Hoya Pests

   <p>Hoyas are liked by three common garden pests, aphids, mealy bugs, red
   spidermites and scales. These are easily controlled by systemic
   insecticides,unless you are opposed to their use. Many control them
   with plain oldrubbing alcohol. Many spray it on the plants right from
   the bottle. Othersdilute it with water and add soap or sticker
   spreaders to it. Some say youshould wash the alcohol off after it has
   done its job, but it isn'tnecessary. It does no harm as long as the
   sun doesn't hit the plants while theyare still wet - it is no
   different than plain water in that respect. Someuse insecticidal
   soaps. I have found the use of alcohol andinsecticidal soaps to be
   worthless, except that alcohol applied to a swab,used to wipe the
   insects off does a pretty good job but this is extremelyimpractical in
   a large collection and could become a full time job. Othersuse preying
   insects. We in Atlanta learned the hard way a few years agothat
   preying insects, which are not native to the area can create
   moreproblems than they solve. Once they feed on the mealy bugs, they
   startlooking for other food and that food may not be what you'd like
   them to feedon. Also when removed from their natural homes they must
   find other nestingplaces to their liking. Ten million non-native Lady
   Beetles crawling allover one's ceilings, floors, furniture and
   inhabiting one's bread box willcure one of importing exotic preying
   insects very quickly. If one has onlya few plants, swabbing with
   alcohol is the ideal method of ridding onesplants of insect pests. In
   a greenhouse with several thousand plants,chemical control is the only
   practical solution. If you can afford to hireprofessional handlers to
   apply the chemicals, I strongly advise it. If youdo it yourself, be
   sure that you follow the directions on the containerprecisely and wear
   protective clothing. The best method of pest control isstill to avoid
   them in the first place. Keeping all new plants isolated forabout six
   weeks before introducing them into your pest free collection isthe
   best advise you will ever follow.
