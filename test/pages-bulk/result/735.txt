<h>Luther's Tragic Mistake: Commentary on Parts 18-23

   <h>John L. Hoh, Jr.
   
   
   <p>Our focus this week in Luther's portions of the tract presented is on
   the Kingdom of David. Luther makes the valid point that the reign of
   David's house continued in spite of the members of that lineage. It
   only took a second generation, in fact, to lose a majority of the
   tribes. After Solomon, the northern ten tribes (known as the Kingdom
   of Israel) followed another king, electing not to follow the dynasty
   of David. Luther also points out the many evil kings in the lineage of
   David. This is important because in Luther's day, as today, the
   dynasty of David no longer exists as a political entity. Obviously it
   is a spiritual dynasty. Hence the sign that again points to Jesus as
   the Christ, the Messiah.

   <p>Even during the Babylonian Captivity, Luther points out, the Davidic
   kings had honor in the Babylonian court. God preserved the dynasty!

   <p>Next, Luther explores the promise to David: "When your days are
   fulfilled and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your
   seed after you." Luther points out that this does not refer to
   immediate descendants but is in fact a Messianic promise. For it is
   after David's death that this seed would be raised up.

   <p>Luther also explores the two houses mentioned: David's eternal house,
   built by God, and the temple build by Solomon, which would be
   destroyed by Babylon's Nebuchadnezzar. One reflects Gospel; the other
   reflects Law. Which do you suppose stands the test of time and which
   no longer exists?

   <p>Luther gets into some more name-calling. Specifically, these words are
   to be considered:

     <p>Anyone who would venture to contradict such clear and convincing
     statements of Scripture regarding the eternal house of David, which
     are borne out by the histories, showing that there were always
     kings or princes down to the Messiah, must be either the devil
     himself or whoever is his follower. For I can readily believe that
     the devil, or whoever it may be, would be unwilling to acknowledge
     a Messiah, but still he would have to acknowledge David's eternal
     house and throne.

   <p>It was Luther himself who stated we are at the same time saints and
   sinners. It was Luther who wrote that "The Law is a constant
   inhabitant in a man's heart, the Gospel a seldom guest." Luther should
   recognize that because of our sinful nature we resist the teaching of
   the Messiah, the Messiah who pays for our sin by dying on a cross. The
   Jews of Jesus' day sought a Messiah that would lead Israel back to
   political glory. But here again Christians generalize. Many Jews in
   Jesus day did await a Messiah who would save them from sin. The New
   Testament is full of Jewish people accepting that Jesus was the
   fulfillment of Scriptural prophecy.
