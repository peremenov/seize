     <h>"Prevention and Treatment of Alcohol Abuse: Vision and Strategies"

   <p>Thanks for that terrific introduction, Dr. Runge. (Dr. Jeffrey Runge,
   Administrator, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration)

   <p>Dr. Runge has done a great job of describing the problem of impaired
   driving. Id like to back up for a few minutes and describe for you the
   fundamental larger problem in our country: that of alcohol abuse and
   alcohol dependency, which can lead to impaired driving and a variety
   of other psychological, social and health problems.

   <p>The great American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald, himself an alcoholic,
   said this of his addiction: "First you take a drink, then the drink
   takes a drink, then the drink takes you."

   <h>Alcohol dependency and alcohol abuse

   <p>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administrations
   (SAMHSA) 2001 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse estimates that
   16.6 million Americans 12 or older -- 7.3% of our population -- are
   dependent upon or abuse either alcohol or illicit drugs.

   <p>Drug and alcohol abuse and dependence affect individuals of all ages,
   from all geographic areas, and all ethnicities, education and
   employment levels.

   <p>No one is immune, and we cannot assume that any particular patient is
   not alcohol dependent when we see him or her in an emergency room, or
   any other clinical setting.

   <p>For example, alcohol-related consequences of heavy
   drinking -- depression, heart failure, and frequent falls -- can be
   mistaken for medical or psychiatric conditions common among the
   elderly.

   <p>We need to continue to educate all people about the risks of alcohol
   dependency. I'm convinced many people -- young people
   especially -- think they are immune.

   <p>HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson has charged me with improving health
   literacy in America, and nowhere is this more important than in the
   area of substance abuse.

   <p>Rates for illicit drug and alcohol dependence and abuse are highest
   among American Indians/Alaska Natives at 12.6 percent; followed by
   Hispanics (7.8 percent); Caucasians (7.5 percent); Blacks (6.2
   percent); and Asians, Native Hawaiians, or other Pacific Islanders
   (3.7 and 4.9 percent, respectively).

   <p>Dependency on alcohol is exhibited by the following symptoms: Craving
   alcohol; an inability to stop drinking once one has started; a
   physical dependence, as evidenced by withdrawal symptoms experienced
   once drinking is stopped, and a high tolerance for the substance.

   <p>Those who abuse alcohol are a slightly different category, including
   those who are dependent on it, as well as others who might not have
   produced the effects I described that would result in them being
   diagnosed with alcohol dependence, but who may drink too much, too
   often, or in situations that increase the risk of harm.

   <h>What are the public health effects of alcohol abuse?

   <p>Science has proven that the abuse of alcohol and alcohol dependency
   can adversely affect physical and mental health, both in the
   individual who drinks, and those around them.
     <p>* Accidents -- Alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes kill someone
       every 30 minutes and injure someone every 2 minutes. 41% of all
       traffic-related deaths are alcohol related. Americans self-report
       120 million episodes of alcohol impaired driving each year! 17,419
       of those episodes resulted in death in 2002. While weve made
       significant progress since the 1980's in reducing drunk driving,
       the number of alcohol-related fatalities is again trending
       upwards.
     <p>* Violence -- Perpetrators of family violence are often using
       alcohol or drugs when they lash out at their victims.
     <p>* Increase in birth defects -- Alcohol can have a number of harmful
       effects on a baby: including mental retardation, learning and
       behavioral problems.
     <p>* Co-morbities of depression, other mental health
       disorders -- People who use or abuse alcohol often suffer from
       depression or other mental illness. 37% of those who are dependent
       upon alcohol have a co-occuring mental disorder.
     <p>* Reduced quality of life: inability to meet work, school or family
       responsibilities -- Most adults -- about 75% -- with substance
       dependence or abuse are employed full or part time. But they are
       not completely functional, and often lose work time to
       alcohol-related illness.
     <p>* Drinking-related medical conditions -- Those who are alcohol
       dependent run a higher risk of liver disease, and various forms of
       cancer, including breast cancer. They are also more likely to be
       injured by falling.

   <p>We can all quote numbers and statistics until weve completely lost
   track.  But those numbers signify real lives and real families.
   These people are our sons and daughters, our neighbors, friends and
   colleagues.

   <p>We've got to do what we can -- government and the medical community in
   partnership -- to restore those lives and dreams, and prevent the
   tragedy from occurring in as many lives and families as possible.

   <p>The problem of alcohol abuse and/or alcohol dependency is particularly
   troubling in young people.

   <p>Teenagers use alcohol more frequently and heavily than all other drugs
   combined.  And it starts early.  41% of ninth graders report drinking
   in the last month.

   <p>And 42% of tenth graders report having been drunk at least once. They
   view it as a rite of passage.  Weve got to let them know drinking
   excessively is not a rite of passage.

   <p>According to research by NIH's National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and
   Alcoholism, kids who drink are more likely to be victims of violent
   crime, to be involved in alcohol-related traffic crashes, and to have
   serious school-related problems.

   <p>Tragically, there is also a strong link between alcohol use among
   adolescents and attempted suicide.

   <p>40% of children who begin using alcohol before age 13 will eventually
   become alcoholics.

   <p>That is not a legacy I want for America's children or their children.
   In America, we want the best for our kids.  We want them to have the
   best there is -- the best opportunities, the best education, the
   greatest happiness.

   <p>We want them to be better off than we are.  As the father of four, I
   feel this with my whole heart, my very being.

   <p>My parents both struggled with alcohol.  Those addictions caused our
   family suffering, hardship and deception.  Each and every family
   touched by addiction, knows the heartbreak of broken dreams.

   <p>Drugs and alcohol are thieves, and liars.  They steal their victims'
   spirits.  Few American families are immune.  I would venture a guess
   that every person in this room knows someone who has fallen victim to
   alcohol dependency or alcohol abuse.

   <p>Prevention -- stopping drug and alcohol abuse before they start -- is
   the best strategy for reducing the tragic public and individual health
   consequences they bring about.

   <p>I like to tell audiences that I am a 'recovering surgeon.'  Two or
   three out of every four cases I cared for as a trauma surgeon in
   Arizona on any given night -- falls, car accidents, shootings,
   domestic violence - were preventable.

   <p>We can only do so much for a victim once he or she is in the emergency
   room.  We need to do more to prevent them from getting there in the
   first place.  Weve got to reach people early, in middle school and
   even before.

   <p>When President Bush nominated me to be Surgeon General, he asked me to
   speak regularly to the nation, particularly students, about alcohol
   and drug abuse, and the tremendous toll they take on our society.

   <p>And that's what I am doing.  Last year I started my 50 Schools in 50
   States initiative to visit at least one school in each of the 50
   states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico during my tenure as Surgeon
   General.

   <p>I tell the kids my own story of overcoming hardship in a poor family
   where there was alcoholism.

   <p>Because alcohol addiction is such a complex and pervasive health
   issue, we must continue to strengthen our public health approach to
   addressing it.

   <p>Such an approach must include extensive efforts in the areas of
   prevention, as I've mentioned, and education, early intervention,
   treatment, and research.

   <p>Many agencies at HHS are dealing with the problem, including SAMHSA,
   CDC, NIH, and NIAAA.

   <p>We fund treatment programs for the addicted, conduct research on the
   effects of alcohol among various populations, and provide information
   to the public about what they can do to get help if they have a
   problem, or someone they love has a problem.

   <p>But government, alone, can only do so much.  We need the partnership
   of the medical community.  The people you represent -- health care
   providers from all settings -- can all play a role in fighting this
   pervasive public health problem.

   <p>Certainly, laboratory alcohol screening is a good early intervention
   tool in many settings.

   <p>In the event there are not the funds for this type of screening,
   health care providers still have the opportunity to screen by asking
   about alcohol use; assessing the level of severity, advising and
   assisting, and arranging for follow-up.

   <p>This can be done by pediatricians, nurse practitioners, psychologist,
   and social workers -- anyone who provides services to a person at risk
   for alcohol abuse, which, as we know, is nearly everyone.

   <p>And those of us who are health practitioners have the power to
   intervene and prevent virtually every time we see a patient.  And we
   can help close the health literacy gap -- the difference between what
   we know as medical professionals and what our patients
   understand -- in every visit.

   <p>A teenager might not know he's at risk for alcoholism; he thinks it's
   cool to drink.

   <p>A pregnant woman might think it's OK to have the occasional glass of
   wine, unaware that even small amounts can cause birth defects.

   <p>And the elderly may not know they are at greater risk for fractures
   with each and every drink they take.  We can help equip them to make
   better decisions.

   <p>Those of us in leadership positions have an additional
   responsibility.  The decisions we make today will have an impact on
   the future course of alcohol abuse and alcohol dependency in this
   country.

   <p>Many of you already have programs within your organizations to fight
   alcohol abuse and dependency, and that's great.  Keep thinking, and
   striving.

   <p>It's too easy to give in to the temptation to view alcohol abuse as
   'routine,' as an 'old problem.'

   <p>Certainly there are other public health issues that get higher billing
   in the newspapers and on television.

   <p>But alcohol abuse and dependency are still serious public health
   problems in America that require our best efforts to fight.

   <p>Thank you.
