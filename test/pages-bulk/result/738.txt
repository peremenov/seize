   <p>Kevin Drum's got a great, great catch here that you'll want to read.
   Believe me, you've gotta see it.
   <p>
  

   <p>I think we can say this is getting interesting.

   <p>The new ARG New Hampshire poll out late this evening has Clark and
   Kerry in a virtual tie (Numbers: Dean 28%, Clark 20%, Kerry 19%).
   
  

   <p>A couple new sites to check out.

   <p>The Dean campaign has put together a section of their site
   ("Bloggerstorm") which has RSS feeds from people with blogs who are on
   the ground in Iowa. I figure they're probably mostly Dean supporters,
   volunteers who've come into the state, and so forth, but not
   exclusively. In any case, it's a neat idea -- a fun way to get
   different perspective on what's going on on the ground in Iowa. Take a
   look.

   <p>The Columbia Journalism Review has a new site ("Campaign Desk") with
   on-going media criticism and watch-dogging of 2004 campaign coverage.
   
    

   <p>Kevin Drum has the most concise, on-point run-down on the Clark
   testimony silliness.

   <p>As Drum says, "The nickel version is that Clark testified before
   Congress in 2002 that Saddam was a dangerous guy and it was
   appropriate to put a lot pressure on him. Then after the war was over
   he wrote an op-ed for the London Times congratulating everyone
   involved for having fought a brilliant campaign."

  <p> The issue here is what it means to be 'anti-war'. I've said I suppose
   a million times now that Clark was a consistent opponent of the
   president's policy. But I've also said that calling him 'anti-war'
   misses the mark. I say this because in our politics this phrase
   'anti-war' has a meaning that goes beyond one's position on a given
   use of military force. It signals a general tone -- one that simply
   doesn't apply to Clark and leads to all sorts of innocent and in other
   cases not so innocent misunderstandings.

   <p>So for instance this very anti-Clark editorial in the Florida
   Times-Union says Clark now has no credibility because his
   congressional testimony "hardly sound[s] like the words of a war
   protester."

  <p> A 'war-protestor'. You get the idea where this goes.

  <p> Similarly, Mickey Kaus says "it's impossible to square this London
   Times article with Clark's current antiwar criticism. Not only is the
   tone the opposite of Bush-bashing, but Clark seems to have forgotten
   that it was "the wrong war at the wrong time," as his adviser Jamie
   Rubin characterizes his current position."

  <p> This is priceless on a couple levels. Apparently, if a pundit decides
   you're a 'bush-basher' and then finds you've said something generous
   about the president, it means you've been untrue to your bush-bashing
   values. I don't know quite what to make of that.

  <p> More to the point, though, I think we've got a more muted version of
   the Times-Union's 'war protestor' line here.

  <p> Mickey's line is that opposition to the president's policy is
   inconsistent with cheering a stunning military victory once the
   decision for war has been made. For an ex-General I don't think it's
   that surprising at all. As I said, Mickey's point is similar to the
   Times-Union's point. Since Clark is running as some sort of war
   protest candidate how could he enthuse over the success of the
   military's rapid victory in Iraq?

  <p> But whatever people think of Clark, I don't think most people in this
   country would find that a contradiction. I do think that will cause
   Clark some difficulties in the Democratic primaries. But the slices of
   the electorate that will decide this election will, I think, share
   that ambivalence.
   <p>
   

  <p> The Zogby poll out of Iowa continues to have Dean, Gephardt and Kerry
   grouped in pretty much a tie (Numbers: Kerry 23%, Dean 22%, Gephardt
   19%, Edwards 18%). But the bigger news is out of ARG's New Hampshire
   poll (Numbers: Dean 28%, Clark 22%, Kerry 18%) Clark remains a half
   dozen points behind Dean. But look at Kerry -- back at 18%. A week ago
   he was at 10%.

  <p> Now, of course, the precise numbers in these tracking polls are
   volatile. But trends over time are usually on the mark.

  <p> A couple days ago over lunch I was talking to a friend about the Kerry
   campaign. And I said the big question about Kerry was whether an
   unexpectedly strong showing in Iowa could whip Kerry back into
   contention in New Hampshire.

   <p>My friend said no, can't happen. And though I'd proposed it as the big
   question, I instantly agreed.

   <p>But clearly I shouldn't have.

   <p>The reason it seemed improbable (to me at least) that Kerry could
   surge back in New Hampshire is, paradoxically, precisely because he
   used to be so far ahead there.

   <p>I can see Clark surging there, or perhaps Edwards, or even Gephardt.
   But that's because their support was never that high. Someone who's
   left Candidate X and is looking for someone new will probably look for
   someone ... well, new, not someone they were supporting before they
   moved on to candidate X.

   <p>Nice theory. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be true. Kerry is
   quickly moving back into contention in New Hampshire.

   <p>Also on the Kerry front, see this article in The New Republic about
   Kerry's field organizer Michael Whouley -- who may be playing an
   important role in the shift.
   
    

  <p> A quick note on some game-playing on Andrew Sullivan's site on the
   Drudge/Clark business.

   <p>I don't want to get into all the particulars. But two points stand out
   to me.

   <p>One is that Sullivan doesn't seem bothered by the fact that Drudge not
   only took the quotes out of context but actually reordered them to
   change their meaning. Why no concern over that? That seems like a
   problem.

   <p>Then he goes on to tendentiously misconstrue most everything Clark
   said. His final judgment is that Clark's stance was basically
   identical to Bush's but that at the key moment he wimped out and got
   cold feet about the war. He also tosses in the self-justifying canard
   that the whole issue was one of getting the permission of France.

   <p>I'll leave it to you to read the testimony or not read it and make
   your own judgments about what Clark says. My read is that it's pretty
   clear that Sullivan's readings in several cases are just tendentious
   misconstruals.

   <p>But this really isn't about Clark, who can stand or fall on his own.
   (Like any candidate he has inconsistencies in his positions over time
   -- just not the extreme, cartoonish ones that certain operatives keep
   trying to push.) This is about a bigger question, a more fundamental
   debate.

   <p>To Sullivan and those who share his view, if you believed that Iraq
   remained a serious and unresolved security question for the United
   States which had to be confronted, and you didn't support the war that
   the president chose to fight, that means that you had a failure of
   nerve (add in here, of course, the standard Munich references.)

   <p>But that's only true if you had an extremely myopic view of the Iraq
   question and believed that quite literally everything had to give way
   before it.

  <p> That was always a foolish read of the situation, and for some it was a
   dishonest one too.

   <p>For my part, the fundamental issue and the issue of urgency was
   finding out the status of Iraq's WMD programs. Once we'd done that
   (and we'd largely done that before we went to war, particularly on the
   nuclear arms front) the question became one of much less urgency --
   one which we had to balance against a series of other priorities.

   <p>What priorities? Al Qaida, for one -- which the Iraq adventure set
   back. More importantly, I think, was creating an international order
   in which American power is durable and enduring.

  <p> As Fareed Zakaria (another weak-willed peacenik) wrote about a year
   ago, in the process of solving the Iraq problem the administration
   created an America problem. As he wrote ...

     <p>[T]he administration is wrong if it believes that a successful war
     will make the world snap out of a deep and widening mistrust and
     resentment of American foreign policy. A war with Iraq, even if
     successful, might solve the Iraq problem. It doesnt solve the
     America problem. What worries people around the world above all
     else is living in a world shaped and dominated by one countrythe
     United States. And they have come to be deeply suspicious and
     fearful of us.

   <p>I think it's pretty clear now that we haven't solved the Iraq problem
   -- or perhaps we got rid of one Iraq problem and created another. But
   even if we had solved it, I think the bargain that Zakaria sketches
   out was a bad one, especially after it'd become quite clear that the
   threat from Iraq was minimal.

   <p>These are complex questions, ones not easily reasoned through by the
   standard nah-nah-nah. But there are some folks who can't get over
   their 1939-envy, their hunger for the Orwell moment. But this wasn't
   one of them. It never was. And the failure to understand that --
   whether by deception or myopia or an honest mistake or the simple need
   for drama that is the curse of intellectuals -- has done us real harm.
   
    

   <p>He reports, you decide?

   watching the president's State of the Union address this Tuesday.
   
     

   <p>A little more unfinished business on the Drudge/Clark smear.

   <p>As I've already told you several times yesterday and today, Drudge got
   hold of some quotes from Clark's September 26th, 2002 congressional
   testimony and distorted them out of recognition by highly selective
   quotation.

   <p>In a subsequent post last night I quoted a passage from a piece which
   ran on the KnightRidder newswire. Here's the passage ...

     <p>Clark's congressional testimony was further distorted Thursday by
     cyber-gossip columnist Matt Drudge, who quoted selected portions of
     Clark's testimony and added sentences that don't appear in the
     transcript on his Web site Thursday. Drudge didn't respond to an
     e-mail request for comment.

   <p>Now, I figured the authors of the piece had done their homework on
   this one, particularly the point claiming he had "added sentences that
   don't appear in the transcript." But it seems that that's not quite
   true. Drudge did something almost as bad, but not quite.

   <p>With the help of TPM's crack editorial assistant Zander Dryer we
   compared the Drudge quotes with the ones in the actual transcript.

   <p>By our read, all but one was right there in the text. And we assume
   the one they're referring to is this one ...

     <p>There's no question that Saddam Hussein is a threat... Yes, he has
     chemical and biological weapons. He's had those for a long time.
     But the United States right now is on a very much different
     defensive posture than we were before September 11th of 2001... He
     is, as far as we know, actively pursuing nuclear capabilities,
     though he doesn't have nuclear warheads yet. If he were to acquire
     nuclear weapons, I think our friends in the region would face
     greatly increased risks as would we.

   <p>As we've reconstructed it, this is where it's from ...

     <p>There's no question that Saddam Hussein is a threat (p. 6)... Yes,
     he has chemical and biological weapons. He's had those for a long
     time. But the United States right now is on a very much different
     defensive posture than we were before September 11th of 2001 (p.
     25-26--Clark is actually making the point that this posture gives
     us time to "work the diplomacy")... he is, as far as we know,
     actively pursuing nuclear capabilities, though he doesn't have
     nuclear warheads yet. If he were to acquire nuclear weapons, I
     think our friends in the region would face greatly increased risks
     as would we (p. 6).

   <p>This is a big no-no. Ellipses (the dot, dot, dots) are one thing. But
   you don't take ellipses out of their order when the reordering changes
   the meaning. However, that's still very different from manufacturing
   quotes. And by our read, that wasn't done.

   <p>Now, none of this changes the substance of the original point. This is
   more a house-keeping post. Drudge and various GOP chat-meisters and
   CNN anchors who followed his lead, cherry-picked a few quotes out of
   context and in so doing made Clark's testimony seem almost the exact
   opposite of what it in fact was.

   <p>Still, we reprinted the clip of KnightRidder's accusation. So we
   wanted to set the record straight.

   <p>(We've emailed the reporters. And we'll let you know what we hear from
   them.)

   <p>Late Update: A number of readers have written in to say that they
   think that Drudge's radical reordering of the order of Clark's words
   is tantamount to manufacturing a quote. Thinking it over I'm half
   inclined to agree. In any case, I'll let you be the judge.
   
    

   <p>On his site this afternoon, Middle Eastern Studies Professor Juan Cole
   -- who runs one of the best blogs on the web -- says he'll be on the
   Newshour tonight talking about Ayatollah Sistani and the growing
   tension over the handover of power in Iraq next summer. That will
   definitely be worth watching.
   
    

   <p>So now Drudge's after Kerry in Iowa, claiming he wanted to abolish the
   Department of Agriculture and cut farm subsidies.

   <p>I know, let's say, rather less about Ag policy than foreign policy. So
   I really have no direct knowledge whether this is a fair
   characterization or not. And I'll be curious to see if someone out
   there can evaluate the statements in their context and get to the
   bottom of it.

   <p>But considering what a scam his dig at Clark ended up being yesterday,
   every benefit of the doubt has to be with Kerry.
   
     

   <p>Ahhh, Perle's of wisdom. Or perhaps unintended self-incrimination. But
   who's counting.

   <p>As you know, I've been flogging since yesterday this issue of the
   ridiculously distorted quotes Drudge used from Wes Clark's September
   26th 2002 congressional testimony. Then this morning the Journal got
   into the act claiming that the silly clips showed that Clark was
   endorsing Perle's views.

   <p>Now, I've been suggesting that people go and read the actual testimony
   to get a sense of whether these cherry-picked lines at all represent
   what Clark said that day. But I know people's lives are busy. And
   perhaps you don't have the time to get through the whole transcript.
   But maybe that's not necessary.

   <p>Toward the end of the session Perle himself characterized Clark's
   position ...

   <p>(Perle's run-down is more than a little disingenuous and he apparently
   felt the need to wait until Clark had left the hearing room for the
   day. But let's forgive him this once.)

     <p>Schrock: Sure, I would love to know Mr. Perle's, you know, the
     general said time is on our side. My guess is you do not believe
     that.

     <p>Perle: No, I don't believe it and frankly I don't think [Clark]
     made a very convincing case in support of that cliche but it was
     one of many cliches. At the end of the day when you sought to
     elicit from him a reconciliation of the view that time is on our
     side with what he acknowledged to be our ignorance of how far along
     Saddam Hussein is, he had no explanation.

     <p>He seems to be preoccupied, and I'm quoting now, with building
     legitimacy, with exhausting all diplomatic remedies as though we
     hadn't been through diplomacy for the last decade, and relegating
     the use of force to a last resort, to building the broadest
     possible coalition, in short a variety of very amorphous, ephemeral
     concerns alongside which there's a stark reality and that is that
     every day that goes by, Saddam Hussein is busy perfecting those
     weapons of mass destruction that he already has, improving their
     capabilities, improving the means with which to deliver them and
     readying himself for a future conflict.

     <p>So I don't believe that time is on our side and I don't believe
     that this fuzzy notion that the most important thing is building
     legitimacy, as if we lack legitimacy now, after all the U.N.
     resolutions that he's in blatant violation of, I don't believe that
     that should be the decisive consideration. So I think General Clark
     simply doesn't want to see us use military force and he has thrown
     out as many reasons as he can develop to that but the bottom line
     is he just doesn't want to take action. He wants to wait.

   <p>Did the Journal guys run their piece by Richard? Seems he disagrees.
   And what about those shows on the cable nets that got taken in? (Yeah,
   I'm talking about you too, CNN) No research departments?
   
    

  

   <p>Let me add my voice to those criticizing the ABC News story on Dean
   and the state trooper on his security detail who apparently was guilty
   of spousal abuse. As nearly as I can tell, this person who worked on
   his security detail beat his wife. But there's no evidence in the
   piece that Dean knew it. Then, while this guy was beating his wife or
   after it had occurred, Dean filed a three page affidavit for use in a
   custody hearing attesting that the trooper, Dennis Madore, was a good
   father.

   <p>But, again, there's no evidence that Dean knew anything about the
   abuse! Or really, any evidence that he should have known. Without
   going into all the ins and outs of the story, Dean seems to have
   played it by the book at every point.

   <p>Now, certainly it's a bit of a touchy thing for Dean. But not because
   he did anything wrong, only because it's always awkward to have
   something ugly like that happen in your proximity.

   <p>But even in a pint-sized state like Vermont, governors have lots of
   people who work with them or for them. And they can't be expected to
   have a handle on what bad acts one or more of them might or might not
   be doing at home.

   <p>It's an impossible standard.

   <p>You might say that the piece can't be that unfair since I was able to
   glean this exculpatory information from it. And to an extent that's
   true. But the piece seems packaged to hit Dean with all sorts of ugly
   insinuations, and quite unfairly.

   <p>The article is headlined "Dean's Trooper" -- a pretty obvious
   reference to the Clinton trooper stories. And the whole story is
   associating him with the extremely (and rightly) hotbutton issue of
   wife-beating, even though, as I noted above, it's wholly unmerited.

   <p>Perhaps this story deserved a small write-up about a minor controversy
   in Vermont state politics. But as it was done, I don't see how you can
   say it wasn't deeply unfair and really a smear.
   
    
   <p>Oh how sad a day it is when even the Wall Street Journal's 'Review &
   Outlook' section (subscription required) cribs its material right from
   the RNC fax printout. Today one of the 'Review & Outlook's' pieces is
   entitled 'General Wesley Perle'.

   <p>They take the cherry-picked quotes Drudge ran yesterday -- the ones he
   seems to have gotten from Ed Gillespie, who also used them in a speech
   yesterday in Little Rock -- and use them to argue that Clark has
   flip-flopped on the war.

   <p>Little more than a year ago, the Journalistas say, he was endorsing
   the views of none other than arch-hawk Richard Perle.

   <p>Now, we know that all the usual suspects have been hitting the
   airwaves on this one, with the crib notes from Movement Central in
   hand. But let's point out one fairly straightforward fact that the
   worthies at the Journal (and the rest who have made this point that
   Clark was supporting Perle's view) seem to leave out.

   <p>If you look at the actual testimony, which I've posted here, you'll
   notice something that couldn't be simpler. The testimony on that day
   before the House Armed Services Committee was set up with one
   supporter of the president's policy and one opponent of it. The first
   was Perle, the second was Clark. And if you read through the
   testimony, that's how it reads. A fuller picture, as usual, shows the
   real story.

   <p>The Journal 'Review & Outlook' piece plays it otherwise because the
   authors aren't troubled by making deceptive arguments by withholding
   key pieces of information which contradict their point -- which is a
   bit of a failing for journalists.
   
    

   <p>Do we need to rewrite the script? This is really getting interesting.

   <p>Today Zogby has John Kerry opening up a five point lead over Howard
   Dean and Richard Gephardt in Iowa. The numbers: Kerry 24%, Dean 19%,
   Gephardt 19%, Edwards 17%.

   <p>Even more interesting however are the ARG numbers out of New
   Hampshire. Today's numbers there are Dean 28%, Clark 23%, Kerry 16%.

   <p>Clark is now a mere five points behind Dean. But, again, Kerry is the
   bigger story.

   <p>He's moved up a point or two a day each day this week. And the
   internals on those numbers tell an interesting tale. As the ARG
   analysis says: "The drop in ballot preference for Howard Dean has
   stabilized and women voters who have switched from Dean are giving
   John Kerry a lift at the expense of Wesley Clark."

   <p>In other words, Dean has lost support. And most of it has gone to
   Clark so far. But Clark is having a real problem getting female voters
   who leave Dean to come to him. And they're going to Kerry.

   <p>If those Zogby numbers out of Iowa are real and Kerry wins the
   caucuses ... well, let's wait and see.
   
    

   <p>So imagine that. The same day Drudge has his 'world exclusive' with
   ridiculously distorted clips of Wes Clark's September 2002
   congressional testimony on Iraq, RNC Chairman Ed Gillespie is in
   Little Rock giving a speech about Clark and he's using the same
   testimony to riff on.

   <p>What a coincidence they were both using google on the same day with
   the same idea, right? Amazing.

   <p>And then, according to KnightRidder, it turns out that Drudge didn't
   even play the smear straight. To quote the KnightRidder ...

     <p>Clark's congressional testimony was further distorted Thursday by
     cyber-gossip columnist Matt Drudge, who quoted selected portions of
     Clark's testimony and added sentences that don't appear in the
     transcript on his Web site Thursday. Drudge didn't respond to an
     e-mail request for comment.

   <p>Oh what a tangled web ...
   
   

   <p>A small note of thanks.

   <p>At a luncheon yesterday in Manhattan (actually at Harold Evans and
   Tina Browns apartment), The Week magazine gave out its first annual
   opinion awards. Tommy Tomlinson of The Charlotte Observer won in the
   local columnist category; Tom Friedman won for Columnist of the year;
   and Paul Krugman won for Issue Advocacy Columnist of the year.

   <p>In a cool development they also decided to make an award in the blog
   category. And Im honored to say that they chose this humble web site.
   So to the editors at The Week, to Harold Evans, and to the judges on
   the panel a very sincere thank you.

   <p>Theres a write-up on it at Editor and Publisher if you want to find
   out more.

   <p>Now there were various luminaries there and it was quite flattering to
   hear that some of these people have visited the site. But let me share
   with you a private moment.

   <p>Early on I noticed that one of the folks there was Arthur Schlesinger,
   Jr.

   <p>Schlesinger, if youre not familiar with him, is one of those few
   people who is quite literally a legend in his own time. I dont know
   precisely how old he is. But, to give you a sense of the range were
   talking about, the book that made his name as an historian, The Age of
   Jackson, came out, I believe, in 1946.

   <p>Schlesinger is an historian and an advisor to president Kennedy, but
   also a towering figure in 20th century American political life,
   particularly in the first phase of the Cold War when his name was
   almost a shorthand for liberal anti-communism and Cold War Liberalism.
   The key book here is The Vital Center, published I believe in 1949 ---
   a phrase and concept of high moment, before it got cheapened in the
   1990s to refer to mere political centrism.

   <p>In any case, as you can probably see, Schlesinger is a rather big deal
   to me. So toward the end of the whole event, after most folks had
   left, I saw Schlesinger and two women standing off to one side. And I
   thought, this is my chance. How can I let it go by?

   <p>So I walked over to where the three were talking and planted myself
   there like a schoolboy and waited.

   <p>And I waited, and waited a bit more until they, a touch awkwardly,
   turned their attention to me. When they did, I introduced myself and
   told him what a great admirer I was of his and what an honor it was to
   meet him and so forth. When I did this I explained that in addition to
   my semi-reputable work as a blogger I was also a trained historian
   with a Ph.D. in American history and the works.

   <p>Now normally I never mention this, or say such things. And Im half
   embarrassed to mention to you that I did. But given Schlesingers merit
   in the profession, and my limited window of opportunity to play up my
   admiration, I thought Id make an exception for myself in this one
   case. I probably figured that Id be making clear that I knew who he
   was, that my admiration wasnt just a pleasantry, or perhaps, candidly,
   that I wasnt just some yahoo.

   <p>To be polite Schlesingers wife asked me to explain to them just what a
   blog is. And though I get this question pretty often, it turns out to
   be a rather challenging one if the people youre trying to explain it
   to dont necessarily have a lot of clear web reference points to make
   sense of what youre saying.

   <p>I ended up telling them that it was something like political
   commentary structured like a personal journal with occasional
   reporting mixed in.

   <p>Now, as I was explaining and watching the looks on everyones faces it
   was incrementally becoming clear to me that this was playing rather
   like saying that something was like a washing machine structured like
   a rhinoceros with the occasional sandwich thrown in. And, as
   Schlesinger himself had said rather little through all this, it was
   also dawning on me that being one of the four guests of honor at this
   little event was providing no guarantee against making a bit of a fool
   of myself.

   <p>So we let the brief conversation come to a merciful end and they
   started to walk away. And, as he was turning to leave, Schlesinger
   said, Are you Joshua Micah M .

   <p>Yeah, that's me.

   <p>You work for Charlie Peters [i.e., for The Washington Monthly]. Im an
   admirer of your journalism.

   <p>Then they walked away.

   <p>My day was made.
   
    

   <p>Lieberman picks up on Drudge's line about Clark's September 2002
   testimony.

   <p>Here's the lede from the just-released Lieberman press release ...

     <p>LIEBERMAN STATEMENT ON CLARK IRAQ TESTIMONY Drudge: Clark made the
     case for war against Iraq

     <p>MANCHESTER, NH -- Joe Lieberman issued the following statement in
     response to the Drudge Report's discovery of congressional
     testimony
     from September 2002 in which Wes Clark made the case for war in
     Iraq.
     The report provides evidence directly contradicting Clark's
     repeated
     claims that he has been "very consistent" on the war "from the very
     beginning."

     <p>Statement by Joe Lieberman

     <p>"Yesterday, Wesley Clark attacked me for pointing out his multiple
     positions on the war in Iraq. It is no longer credible for Wesley
     Clark to assert that he has always had only one position on the war
     - being against it. His own testimony before Congress shows
     otherwise.

     <p>"He may think it is 'old-style politics' to point this out, but the
     only thing old here is a candidate not leveling with the American
     people. If we want to begin anew and replace George Bush, we need
     to level with the American people, which is what I have done in
     this campaign and throughout my career. You may not always agree
     with me but you will always know where I stand."

   <p>Woe to the Democrat who uses Drudge as a clip service!

   <p>I don't know if the Lieberman folks looked at the actual testimony --
   as opposed to the drudged version -- before sending out this press
   release. But you can, in the post below.
   
   

   <p>Elaine Kamarck is basically a founder of the New Democrat movement,
   long associated with the DLC and other similarly-inclined groups. Here
   she is in Newsday today coming out for Dean.
   
  

   <p>Ahhh, imagine that. More Drudgitprop.

   <p>You may have noticed that Drudge has a blaring headline: "WES CLARK
   MADE CASE FOR IRAQ WAR BEFORE CONGRESS; TRANSCRIPT REVEALED" (...
   followed by all the 'world exclusive' silliness.)

   <p>And following that, needless to say, are some highly cherry-picked
   clips out of testimony he gave on September 26th, 2002, during the
   lead-up to war. (The panel's testimony was structured as Clark versus
   Richard Perle, the other witness on the panel that day.)

   <p>Rather than get into the particulars, here's the statement Clark
   delivered, with the portions quoted by Drudge in bold. And you decide
   whether they accurately capture Clark's meaning and what Clark's
   testimony actually was.

     <p>Thank you, sir. There's no question that Saddam Hussein is a
     threat. I was in the joint staff in October of 1994. I think the
     date was -- I think it was the 8th of October. It was a Thursday
     morning. The intelligence officer walked in and said, "Sir, you're
     not going to believe this. Here are the pictures. You can't be
     believe it. This is the Republican Guard. They're right back in the
     same attack positions that they occupied four years ago before they
     invaded Kuwait and here are the two divisions and there are signs
     of mobilization and concerns north, and we can't understand it."
     And General Peay was the commander of CENTCOM. Shalikashvili, I
     think was, visiting Haiti at the time with Secretary of Defense
     Perry, and we rushed together, we put together a program. General
     Peay deployed some 15,000 American troops and aircraft over to
     block it and after a few days, Saddam Hussein recognized what a
     difficult position he put himself in and withdrew the troops. But,
     we had not expected it. It was an unanticipated move. It made no
     sense from our point of view for Saddam Hussein to do this but he
     did it. It was signaled warning that Saddam Hussein is not only
     malevolent and violent but he is also to some large degree
     unpredictable at least to us.

     <p>I'm sure he has a rationale for what he's doing, but we don't
     always know it. He does retain his chemical and biological
     capabilities to some extend and he is, as far as we know, actively
     pursuing nuclear capabilities, though he doesn't have nuclear
     warheads yet. If he were to acquire nuclear weapons, I think our
     friends in the region would face greatly increased risks as would
     we. Saddam might use these weapons as a deterrent while launching
     attacks against Israel or his other neighbors. He might threaten
     American forces in the region. He might determine that he was the
     messenger of Allah and simply strike directly at Israel, or Israel
     weighing the possibilities of blackmail or aggression might feel
     compelled to strike Iraq first. Now, Saddam has been pursing
     nuclear weapons and we've been living with this risk for over 20
     years. He does not have the weapons now as best we can determine.
     He might have the weapons in a year or two if the control for the
     highly-enriched uranium and other fissionable materials broke down.
     I think his best opportunity would have been to go to his friend
     Slobodan Milosevic and ask for those materials during the time of
     the Kosovo campaign, since there was active collusion between the
     Serbs and the Iraqis, but apparently if he asked for them he didn't
     get them because the Serbs have turned them over for us.

     <p>If he can't get the highly-enriched uranium, then it might take him
     five years or more to go through a centrifuge process or gaseous
     diffusion process to enrich the uranium, but the situation is not
     stable. The U.N. weapons inspectors who, however ineffective they
     might have been and there's some degree of difference of opinion on
     that, nevertheless provided assistance in impeding his development
     programs. They've been absent for four years, and the sanction
     regime designed to restrict his access to weapons materials and
     resources has been continuously eroded, and therefore the situation
     is not stable.

     <p>The problem of Iraq is not a problem that can be postponed
     indefinitely, and of course Saddam's current efforts themselves are
     violations of international law as expressed in the U.N.
     resolutions. Our President has emphasized the urgency of
     eliminating these weapons and weapons programs. I strongly support
     his efforts to encourage the United Nations to act on this problem
     and in taking this to the United Nations, the president's clear
     determination to act if the United States can't -- excuse me, if
     the United Nations can't provides strong leverage for under girding
     ongoing diplomatic efforts.

     <p>CLARK: But the problem of Iraq is only one element of the broader
     security challenges facing our country. We have an unfinished
     worldwide war against Al Qaida, a war that has to be won in
     conjunction with friends and allies and that ultimately will be won
     as much by persuasion as by the use of force. We've got to turn off
     the Al Qaida recruiting machine. Now some 3,000 deaths on September
     11th testify to the real danger from Al Qaida, and I think everyone
     acknowledges that Al Qaida has not yet been defeated.

     <p>As far as I know, I haven't seen any substantial evidence linking
     Saddam's regime to the Al Qaida network, though such evidence may
     emerge. But nevertheless, winning the war against Al Qaida and
     taking actions against the weapons programs in Iraq, that's two
     different problems that may require two different sets of
     solutions. In other words, to put it back into military parlance,
     Iraq they're an operational level problem. We've got other
     operational level problems in the Middle East, like the ongoing
     conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Al Qaida and
     the foundation of radical extremist fundamentalist Islam, that's
     the strategic problem. We've got to make sure that in addressing
     the operational problem we're effective in going after the larger
     strategic problem. And so, the critical issue facing the United
     States right now is how to force action against Saddam Hussein and
     his weapons programs without detracting from our focus on Al Qaida
     or our efforts to deal with other immediate mid and long-term
     security problems.

     <p>I'd like to offer the following observations by way of how we could
     proceed. First of all, I do believe that the United States
     diplomacy in the United Nations will be strengthened if the
     Congress can adopt a resolution expressing U.S. determination to
     act if the United Nations can not act. The use of force must remain
     a U.S. option under active consideration.

     <p>Such congressional resolution need not, at this point, authorize
     the use of force. The more focused the resolution on Iraq, the more
     focused it is on the problems of weapons of mass destruction. The
     greater its utility in the United Nations, the more nearly
     unanimous the resolution, the greater its utility is, the greater
     its impact is on the diplomatic efforts under way.

     <p>The president and his national security team have got to deploy
     imagination, leverage, and patience in working through the United
     Nations. In the near term, time is on our side and we should
     endeavor to use the United Nations if at all possible. This may
     require a period of time for inspections or the development of a
     more intrusive inspection regime such as Richard Perle has
     mentioned, if necessary backed by force. It may involve cracking
     down on the eroding sanctions regime and countries like Syria who
     are helping Iraq illegally export oil enabling Saddam Hussein to
     divert resources to his own purposes.

     <p>We have to work this problem in a way to gain worldwide legitimacy
     and understanding for the concerns that we rightly feel and for our
     leadership. This is what U.S. leadership in the world must be. We
     must bring others to share our views not be too quick to rush to
     try to impose them even if we have the power to do so. I agree that
     there's a risk that the inspections would fail to provide evidence
     of the weapons program. They might fail, but I think we can deal
     with this problem as we move along, and I think the difficulties of
     dealing with this outcome are more than offset by the opportunities
     to gain allies, support, and legitimacy in the campaign against
     Saddam Hussein.

     <p>If the efforts to resolve the problem by using the United Nations
     fail, either initially or ultimately, then we need to form the
     broadest possible coalition including our NATO allies and the North
     Atlantic Council if we're going to have to bring forces to bear. We
     should not be using force until the personnel, the organizations,
     the plans that will be required for post conflict Iraq are prepared
     and ready. This includes dealing with requirements for humanitarian
     assistance, police and judicial capabilities, emergency medical and
     reconstruction assistance and preparations for a transitional
     governing body and eventual elections, perhaps even including a new
     constitution.

     <p>Ideally, the international/multinational organizations will
     participate in the readying of such post conflict operations, the
     United Nations, NATO, other regional organization, Islamic
     organizations, but we have no idea how long this campaign could
     last, and if it were to go like the campaign against the Afghans,
     against the Taliban in which suddenly the Taliban collapsed and
     there we were.

     <p>We need to be ready because if suddenly Saddam Hussein's government
     collapses and we don't have everything ready to go, we're going to
     have chaos in that region. We may not get control of all the
     weapons of mass destruction, technicians, plans, capabilities; in
     fact, what may happen is that we'll remove a repressive regime and
     have it replaced with a fundamentalist regime which contributes to
     the strategic problem rather than helping to solve it.

     <p>So, all that having been said, the option to use force must remain
     on the table. It should be used as the last resort after all
     diplomatic means have been exhausted unless there's information
     that indicates that a further delay would represent an immediate
     risk to the assembled forces and organizations. And, I want to
     underscore that I think the United States should not categorize
     this action as preemptive. Preemptive and that doctrine has nothing
     whatsoever to do with this problem. As Richard Perle so eloquently
     pointed out, this is a problem that's longstanding. It's been a
     decade in the making. It needs to be dealt with and the clock is
     ticking on this. Obviously once initiated, a military operation
     should aim for the most rapid accomplishment of its operational
     aims and prompt turnover to follow on organizations and agencies,
     and I think if we proceed as outlined above, we may be able to
     minimize the disruption to the ongoing campaign against Al Qaida.
     We could reduce the impact on friendly governments in the region
     and even contribute to the resolution of other regional issues,
     perhaps such as the Arab-Israeli conflict, Iranian efforts to
     develop nuclear capabilities and Saudi funding for terrorism. But
     there are no guarantees. The war is unpredictable. It could be
     difficult and costly and what is at risk in the aftermath is an
     open-ended American ground commitment in Iraq and an even deeper
     sense of humiliation in the Arab world which could intensify our
     problems in the region and elsewhere.

     <p>The yellow light is flashing. We have a problem. We've got to
     muster the best judgment in this country. We've got to muster the
     will of the American people and we've got to be prepared to deal
     with this problem, but time is on our side in the near term and we
     should use it. Thank you.

   <p>I didn't want to clutter up the site with the entire transcript of the
   session, which runs fairly long. But if you're interested in getting a
   good sense of what Clark's position was on the war, I'd highly
   recommend you read the extensive questioning of Perle and Clark by the
   congressmen and women on the panel, in which they both elaborated on
   their views. This is where Drudge's other text-bites come from. You
   can read the entire transcript here.
   
    

   <p>Surprising numbers out today. Zogby has Kerry not simply surging but
   actually in the lead in Iowa: Kerry 22%, Dean 21%, Gephardt 21%.
   Especially in a daily tracking poll a point difference means less than
   nothing (note to statisticians: don't even say it). But this does
   square with what a lot of people have been saying about Kerry's move
   in the state.

   <p>(Also, with the numbers that close, I'd want to hear more both about
   the ground organization of each candidate and how regionally
   concentrated their support is in the state.)

   <p>Meanwhile ARG's New Hampshire tracking poll has Dean 29%, Clark 24%,
   Kerry 15%.

   <p>The common denominator seems pretty clear: Dean's support is falling
   -- not precipitously, but measurably -- and at least some Dean
   supporters appear to be going to his near rivals in each state.
   
   

   <p>With Clark rising in the polls, Dean is back to accusing Wes Clark of
   being a Republican.

   <p>According to Reuters, today he said that he thought Clark was a "good
   guy, but I truly believe he's a Republican ... I do not think somebody
   ought to run in the Democratic primary and then make the general
   election a Republican primary between two Republicans."

   <p>If Clark is a Republican, why did he vote for the Democratic
   presidential ticket in 1992, 1996 and 2000?

   <p>If the issue is Reagan or Nixon, those two won pretty handily (at
   least for reelection). To win, any Democrat will need lots of
   Democrats who pulled the lever for them too.
   
    

   <p>Briefly on this matter of Dean and 'unilateral' action in Bosnia. I'm
   running late on a few deadlines at the moment. So I don't have time to
   go into this at length. But I don't think this is much of a
   contradiction, except possibly on the most superficial level.

   <p>The tenor of the whole Iraq debate has tended to make a fetish out of
   the narrow meaning of unilateral and multilateral. Both have their
   place. And I don't think it's a contradiction on Dean's part at all to
   say we should not have waited for NATO to conduct air operations in
   Bosnia and yet also mount a critique of the president's approach on
   Iraq.

   <p>Remember that in Kosovo, we knew the Russians would veto our plan. So
   we didn't go to the UN, but went with NATO instead. As Fareed Zakaria
   aptly noted almost a year ago, the US never got UN approval for any of
   its three major military engagements in the 1990s. And few significant
   players suggested that it was necessary for us to do so.

   <p>So why all the hollering now over Iraq? Some on the right suggest that
   this is because of animosity toward president Bush or a rise in
   'anti-Americanism.' But it's not. It's because the US has begun
   playing by very different rules in the last three years. It has moved
   from being a dominant power which most often works through a sort of
   informal consensus to one that increasingly seeks to act through
   dictation. We've become impatient with the minimal restraints on our
   power created by our participation in various international
   institutions and agreements -- ones which actually serve to magnify
   our power. And nations around the world -- not to mention publics --
   have increasingly looked to the UN as a brake on US power.

   <p>In short, the issue is not so much whether you get sign off from the
   UN or NATO on every particular thing you do. It's a question of the
   totality of one's approach to allies and the rest of the nation's of
   the world. By that measure, the whole situation in the Balkans and the
   current one in Iraq could scarcely be more different.

   <p>This is a big issue and one that deserves more discussion. It's also
   worth noting that getting our key European allies on board in the
   Balkans did play a big role in the long-term success of those
   operations -- and the diplomatic isolation which eventually played a
   key role in Milosevic's fall. And perhaps Dean has himself made too
   much of a fetish out of the word 'unilateralism' without fleshing out
   the critique more fully. But basically this issue with Dean and
   'unilateral' action in Bosnia just strikes me as more silly word-game
   gotcha. Nothing more than that.
   
   

   <p>I have a luncheon I'm going to at noon, so just a quick update on
   where things seem to stand in Iowa and New Hampshire. One of the
   campaigns has tracking numbers out of Iowa which shows each of the top
   three -- Dean, Gephardt and Kerry -- clumped to within a point or two.
   And today's Zogby poll seems to point in the same direction Dean 24%,
   Gephardt 21%, Kerry 21%.

   <p>As things run down to the wire, you hear a lot of things, many of
   which aren't confirmable. But I know that several days ago one very
   high-level Iowa Democrat (one who hasn't endorsed anyone) told folks
   that he thought that if the caucuses were held then (late last week)
   that Kerry would probably beat Gephardt and possibly even win the
   whole thing.

   <p>I don't think anyone has any really solid clue what's happening. But
   it does give you a sense of the fluidity of the race -- and not just
   the Dean-Gephardt contest we've all been focusing on.

   <p>Meanwhile, the ARG tracking poll in New Hampshire shows some more
   movement after several days when everyone seemed to stay in place.
   Dean 32%, Clark 22%, Kerry 13%.

   <p>As always, the inevitable disclaimer. Tracking polls are notoriously
   volatile and often show 'trends' that are the result of low sample
   numbers on given days. Still, over time, they give some sense of where
   things are going. And I think Dean's move back on to the offensive
   shows that his people are seeing the same thing.
   
    

   <p>Apparently the ARG pollsters were on to something.

   <p>This from tonight's WMUR from New Hampshire: "Attorney General Peter
   Heed said someone has been calling voters who are unaffiliated with a
   party and telling them that they can't vote in the primary -- which is
   untrue. Heed said his office has received complaints from town and
   city clerks as well as undeclared voters who said they are being told
   they cannot vote."
   
   

   <p>Some things are worth listening to again and again ...

     <p>DIANE SAWYER

     <p>(Off Camera) When you take a look back, Vice President Cheney said,
     "there is no doubt Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction."
     Not programs, not intent. There is no doubt he has weapons of mass
     destruction. Secretary Powell said "100 to 500 tons of chemical
     weapons." And now the inspectors say that there's no evidence of
     these weapons existing right now. The yellow cake in Niger. George
     Tenet has said that shouldn't have been in your speech. Secretary
     Powell talked about mobile labs. Again, the intelligence, the
     inspectors have said they can't confirm this, they can't
     corroborate. Nuclear, suggestions that he was on the way on an
     active nuclear program. David Kay, "we have not discovered
     significant evidence of ... "

     <p>PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH

     <p>Yet.

     <p>DIANE SAWYER

     <p>(Off Camera) Is it "yet"?

     <p>PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH

     <p>But what David Kay did discover was they had a weapons program. And
     had that -that -let me finish for a second. Now it's more extensive
     than, than missiles. Had that knowledge been examined by the United
     Nations or had David Kay's report been placed in front of the
     United Nations, he, Saddam Hussein, would have been in material
     breach of 1441, which meant it was a causis belli. And, look, there
     is no doubt that Saddam Hussein was a dangerous person. And there's
     no doubt we had a body of evidence proving that. And there is no
     doubt that the President must act, after 9/11, to make America a
     more secure country.

     <p>DIANE SAWYER

     <p>(Off Camera) Again, I'm just trying to ask, these are supporters,
     people who believed in the war who have asked the question.

     <p>PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH

     <p>Well, you can keep asking the question. And my answer's gonna be
     the same. Saddam was a danger. And the world is better off because
     we got rid of him.

     <p>DIANE SAWYER

     <p>(Off Camera) But stated as a hard fact, that there were weapons of
     mass destruction as opposed to the possibility that he could move
     to acquire those weapons still.

     <p>PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH

     <p>So what's the difference?

     <p>DIANE SAWYER

     <p>(Off Camera) Well ...

     <p>PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH

     The possibility that he could acquire weapons. If he were to
     acquire weapons, he would be the danger. That's, that's what I'm
     trying to explain to you. A gathering threat, after 9/11, is a
     threat that needed to be dealt with. And it was done after 12 long
     years of the world saying the man's a danger. And so, we got rid of
     him. And there's no doubt the world is a safer, freer place as a
     result of Saddam being gone.

     <p>DIANE SAWYER

     (Off Camera) But, but, again, some, some of the critics have said
     this, combined with the failure to establish proof of elaborate
     terrorism contacts, has indicated that there's just not precision,
     at best, and misleading, at worst.

     <p>PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH

     <p>Yeah. Look, what, what we based our evidence on was a very sound
     national intelligence estimate.

     <p>DIANE SAWYER

     <p>(Off Camera) Nothing should have been more precise?

     <p>PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH

     <p>I, I made my decision based upon enough intelligence to tell me
     that this country was threatened with Saddam Hussein in power.

     <p>DIANE SAWYER

     <p>(Off Camera) What would it take to convince you he didn't have
     weapons of mass destruction?

     <p>PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH

     <p>Saddam Hussein was a threat. And the fact that he is gone means
     America is a safer country.

   <p>What's the difference?

   <p>That says it all.
   
   

   <p>Everybody's giving Paul O'Neill a hard time now for partly backing
   down on some of his accusations against the president.

   <p>But this misses the point entirely. Look what an improvement this is!
   John DiIulio barely made it 24 hours after the horsehead showed up in
   his bed before he was telling the world he "sincerely apologizes and
   is deeply remorseful."

   <p>The O'Neill story's been out there for like a week and it's two days
   since the 60 Minutes interview and even now he's not taking it all
   back! I think what we've got here is a little rope-a-dope. O'Neill
   needs to give them a little but it's not yet a full Kamenev moment.
   More like Bukharin? I'll have to go back and review the testimony.
   
   

   <p>Hilarious. At about 5:40 PM on Tuesday evening and there's a back and
   forth with Peter Beinart and Deborah Perry from the Independent
   Women's Forum arguing about the O'Neill stuff on CNN.

   <p>Beinart raised the quite apt point that members of the Bush
   administration gave Bob Woodward classified documents for his highly
   flattering book about the lead-up to the war (did I mention it was
   highly flattering?). So why wasn't there an investigation then?

   <p>Deborah responded that this was a case "where the Bush administration
   was working with" the reporter. (That's what I caught by ear and
   remembered for the few moments it took me to put the dog down and grab
   the computer.) In other words, when it's a compulsively friendly
   reporter who's working with the White House on an adoring book, then
   they can give out classified documents at their discretion. But when
   it's unfriendly, you go to the slammer!

   <p>(Late Update: Here's the actual quote from the transcript: "But,
   again, that was the Bush administration working with Bob Woodward in
   terms of what they were willing to...")

   <p>Deborah, I want to thank you on behalf of all of us for that unwitting
   moment of candor! I'd like to encourage you to also defend the White
   House on the Plame matter.

   <p>(We can leave aside for the moment that there's no reason to believe
   the O'Neill docs were actually classified. The classification system
   is a little more formalized and complex then just putting 'secret'
   across the top of a document.)
   
   

   <p>I don't know quite what to make of this article on Wes Clark by Chris
   Suellentrop. Chris runs through a number of statements Clark has made
   on the campaign trail and, with those quotes, advances the argument
   that Clark, as much as Dean, has a "propensity for speaking
   imprecisely off the cuff."

   <p>There's a pretty widespread tendency in the mainstream media to say
   that Clark makes off-the-wall claims about the war on terrorism or the
   Iraq war. (A frequent example is the claim that the civilians at the
   Pentagon had a list of countries in line for regime change after
   Iraq.) It's more accurate to say that Clark has a habit of making
   points that many in high political circles consider impolitic,
   impolite or simply in poor taste to bring up.

   <p>Case in point, there was a list -- if by list we mean a list of
   countries that many in the Pentagon (civilian side) were pushing to
   hit next after Iraq. I know this. Most every reporter who covers the
   Pentagon knows this. And yet the bully-boys try to intimidate people
   out of saying it.

   <p>But back to Chris.

   <p>Here's Chris' quote number two.

   <p>Chris prefaces it with this headline question: "Bush 'never intended'
   to get Osama Bin Laden?"

   <p>And here's the quote.

     <p>We bombed Afghanistan, we missed Osama Bin Laden, partly because
     the president never intended to put the resources in to get Osama
     Bin Laden. All along, right after 9/11, they'd made their mind up,
     I guess, that we were going to go after Saddam Hussein. That's what
     people in the Pentagon told me. And they capped the resources,
     stopped the commitment to Afghanistan, and started shifting to
     prepare to go after Saddam Hussein

   <p>Is it just me, or is the story here that Chris completely distorts
   what Clark said? What's 'imprecise' about this statement. Provocative?
   Critical? Yes. But imprecise?

   <p>(I have to say that each of the quotes Chris mentions seems in same
   category to me.)

   <p>Clark didn't say Bush didn't intend to get bin Laden. He said he never
   intended to deploy the necessary resources because he placed a higher
   priority on the impending war in Iraq.

   <p>Now the president and his advisors could and probably would respond
   that they mobilized sufficient resources for both aims. But the fact
   that bin Laden and many of the other key targets were not captured at
   least makes it reasonable to argue that the forces were insufficient.
   (Indeed, reporting on the particulars backs this up too.)

   <p>These are the sorts of points and arguments that should be at the
   center of the national campaign, whichever Democrat secures the
   nomination -- the balance of resources mobilized to combat al Qaida
   and Iraq, and which was more central to the country's security.
   
    

   <p>So now the White House has pilloried Paul ONeill as a sorry doofus
   and, by all appearances, launched a punitive investigation against
   him.

   <p>How about denying any of his claims or those in Suskinds book?

   <p>Just a thought ...

   <p>And will O'Neill go the way of John DiIulio and Nick Smith? Where's
   the document they want him to sign? And who writes them?

   <p>From the archives, DiIulio's Kamenev moment: "John DiIulio agrees that
   his criticisms were groundless and baseless due to poorly chosen words
   and examples. He sincerely apologizes and is deeply remorseful."

   <p>Yikes, I'd hate to make enemies out of these guys. Or, wait ...
   
   

   <p>Number of days between Novak column outing Valerie Plame and
   announcement of investigation: 74 days.

   <p>Number of days between O'Neill 60 Minutes interview and announcement
   of investigation: 1 day.

  <p> Having the administration reveal itself as a gaggle of hypocritical
   goons ... priceless.
   
   

   <p>Oh, they can do better than that, can't they?

   <p>CNN's headline story on the O'Neill story reads: "Cabinet members
   defend Bush from O'Neill"

   <p>And then, when you click through, it turns out the cabinet members are
   Don Evans (the president's Texas crony and political fixer) and John
   Snow (O'Neill's tepidly respected successor at Treasury).

   <p>None of the bigs? That's all? No Colin? We're Rummyless?
   
    

   <p>Well, this battle in Iowa is truly going down to the wire.

  <p> Today Zogby has a poll out with Dean 25%, Gephardt 23%, Kerry 14%,
   Edwards 13%. And Zogby says Edwards was picking up steam through the
   three days of interviews.

   <p>Those numbers are somewhat countered by two other polls out in the
   last two days which have the Dean/Gephardt spread at 7% (LA Times) and
   5% (Quad-City Times/KWQC). But clearly it's pretty tight.

   <p>At various points over the three-plus years I've run this site I've
   commented on the quality of Zogby's polls (here's one of the first
   things I ever wrote about him, an article in Slate from almost four
   years ago). Zogby's polls do often pick up on trends well in advance
   of their appearance in other polls. But almost as frequently he seems
   to pick up on trends that turn out not to exist. So to the extent that
   you can personify methodology I see him as ingenious but erratic.

   <p>That's I suppose just a roundabout way of saying that I don't know
   quite what to make of his very tight margin between the two top
   contenders.

   <p>More generally, however, the closeness of these margins and the
   broader dynamics of this race, I think, tell us that we don't know
   what's going to happen on Caucus eve.

   <p>The Caucus system works by a sort of snowbound version of the
   uncertainty principle. The particulars are so detailed that I'm sure
   to get some part of it wrong. But basically how the caucuses work is
   that everyone shows up and they divide into groups based on candidate
   preference. But if your candidate has less than 15% of the attendees
   then your guy (or gal) is out.

   <p>(Presumably, at the beginning of the evening someone gets out an
   envelope, counts who's there and does some quick math to determine how
   many people get you over 15%. I'd be ruled out for that job.)

   <p>Once your candidate is out you have to pick another.

  <p> Now, the numbers we're seeing are statewide. And the demographic gap
   between, say, the Gephardt and Dean voters is great enough that in
   particular caucus locations the spread is apt to be very different.
   However, you don't have to look too long at the numbers to see that
   there are some candidates with not insubstantial support that are
   going to get knocked out on the first round at many locations.

   <p>To put it succinctly, in many caucuses, the issue is going to be less
   whether Gephardt and Dean are separated by 2% or 6% as who the Kerry
   and Edwards supporters go to on the second round.

   <p>Before you flame me with your emails, I'm not trying to prejudge
   Kerry's and Edwards' chances. But you can see the level of uncertainty
   that plays into the calculus.

   <p>On the face of it, it would seem this volatility would work against
   Dean since the race has been polarized between Dean as the outsider
   vs. anti-Dean Washington candidates. If you're for Kerry, who has made
   opposition to Dean an increasing focus of his campaign, do you switch
   to Dean or to Gephardt, if Kerry falls under 15% if your caucus? The
   latter seems more logical to me. But so many factors must play in to
   this that I'm not sure 'logic', especially from a thousand miles away,
   gets you very close to the truth.
   
   

   <p>Something a lot of us have been saying for a long time. This from
   Time's article on O'Neill ...

     <p>"The biggest difference between then and now," O'Neill tells
     Suskind about his two previous tours in Washington, "is that our
     group was mostly about evidence and analysis, and Karl (Rove), Dick
     (Cheney), Karen (Hughes) and the gang seemed to be mostly about
     politics. It's a huge distinction."

   <p>Politics and ideology.
   
  

   <p>From an AP story running this evening ...

     <p>At the town hall meeting in Rochester, a woman asked Dean why he
     was complaining about his rivals' attacks, but distributing fliers
     against Clark. Dean said he wasn't aware of the fliers and the
     decision was made by local staff. But he said he would be happy to
     defend them.

     <p>"If the fliers said that General Clark was originally for the war
     and now is against it, that's accurate," Dean said. "If the fliers
     said that General Clark said it was perfectly fine to let our
     software jobs to got to India and replace them with other jobs, he
     did say that. There is a difference in attack ads and just pointing
     out the facts."

   <p>This point about the Iraq war is simply false. I hesitate to call it a
   lie because I don't know if Dean knows it's false, though he should.

   <p>The falsity of the claim is well-known to anyone who closely followed
   the debate over Iraq in the lead-up to the war and particularly
   Clark's role in that debate.

   <p>There's a lot of foolishness being peddled to the effect that Clark is
   claiming he's an "anti-war" candidate when he's not. (This is the
   upshot of the flyers Dean campaign workers are distributing at Clark
   rallies.) This is a very loaded term. One can believe this whole
   enterprise was badly misconceived and handled even worse and not have
   that sentiment diminished by not singing folk songs.

   <p>And why doesn't Dean know his campaign workers are distributing these
   flyers? Everyone else has known for like a week.
