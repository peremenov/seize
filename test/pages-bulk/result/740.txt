   <p>BREWSTER, N.Y., March 9, 2004--Touchstone Applied Science Associates,
   Inc. (OTCBB: TASA), buoyed by its best-ever showing at the beginning
   of a fiscal year, today reported first-quarter net income of $62,000,
   or 2 cents per diluted share, compared with a loss from continuing
   operations of $139,000, or five cents per diluted share, a year
   earlier. Including discontinued operations, the prior- year loss was
   $296,000, or 11 cents per diluted share. Net revenue for the quarter
   ended January 31, 2004, climbed more than 18 percent to $2.1 million
   from $1.8 million for continuing operations in the fiscal 2003 first
   quarter.

   <p>"Our proprietary test products, especially those designed for students
   with limited English proficiency, were the primary drivers in
   delivering our first profitable first quarter in our 27 years of
   operations," said Andrew L. Simon, president and chief executive
   officer. "Historically, the first two quarters of the fiscal year have
   been our softest because of the buying patterns of school districts
   and state education authorities. However, provisions of the federal
   `No Child Left Behind' act have prompted some agencies to place orders
   earlier in the year. In the first quarter, Missouri and Rhode Island
   purchased our MACII tests to comply with Title III of the act, which
   relates to improving language skills for limited English proficient
   students."

   <h>Proprietary Revenue Up 28%

   <p>Simon noted that the proprietary business unit, which provides test
   services and products for reading assessment in the K-12 market,
   achieved a more than 28 percent increase in revenues to $1 million
   from $795,000 in the fiscal 2003 first quarter. In addition to
   increases in the English proficiency product, Simon said the company
   received a sizable order for its Degrees of Reading PowerÂ® reading
   assessment program from the city of Los Angeles. The increase in
   proprietary revenue contributed to an improvement in gross profit
   margin to 48 percent from 44 percent a year earlier.

   <p>BETA, TASA's custom test services unit, also had a solid quarter, with
   a nearly 10 percent increase in revenue to $1.1 million from $972,000
   in the first quarter of fiscal 2003, Simon said.

   <p>"In part because of the previously announced $9.4 million increase and
   two-and-a-half-year extension of our Michigan contract, which now runs
   to September 2007, we see continued strength in the custom segment
   also," Simon added.

   <h>Strong Growth Outlook

   <p>"We continue to benefit from the new federal emphasis on education,"
   Simon said. "As a result of the growing national demand for assessment
   testing and services, as well as increasing acceptance of our products
   and services, we see ongoing growth in both our business areas. Most
   recently, Arkansas became the eighth state to accept our MAC II test,
   either as the exclusive test or as an approved test, for charting the
   progress of students who have limited proficiency in English. In
   addition, with our decision last year to expand our test scanning and
   scoring services, we expect further opportunities for growth as we
   begin to pick up third-party scoring business.

   <p>"We remain comfortable with our outlook for 20 percent compound annual
   growth over the next few years."

   <h>Solid Balance Sheet

   <p>Simon also noted the early repayment of the company's debt and the
   sale-leaseback of its headquarters building, all completed in 2003,
   have contributed to a strong balance sheet with essentially no
   long-term debt. At the end of the first quarter, the company reported
   a cash position of $405,000, a current ratio of 2.6 to 1 and
   stockholders' equity of $5.9 million, equivalent to about $2.26 per
   share.
