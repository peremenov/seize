                          <h>Walking as a way of life

      <p>Regular exercise provides a myriad of health benefits for senior
     adults including a stronger heart, a positive mental outlook and an
           increased chance of remaining indefinitely independent

     <p>"Use it or lose it."

     <p>That's what doctors these days are telling senior citizens about
     their bodies.

     <p>But seniors needn't think they have to sign up for high-impact
     aerobics classes or run 10K races to stay in shape. Instead,
     fitting a simple 35-minute walk into their daily activities can
     keep them physically strong and agile.

     <p>"Walking is a tremendously good activity for senior citizens. It's
     cheap, it's simple, almost anybody can do it and it Walking has a
     multitude of health benefits for everyone. It helps seniors has
     very real benefits for maintain mobility and independence. Older
     adults," said Dr. Michael Pratt, the acting chief for the Physical
     Activity and Health Branch in the Division of Nutrition and
     Physical Activity at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
     in Atlanta (CDC).

     <p>Dr. Pratt, is a member of the "Partnership for a Walkable America"
     -- a coalition of private, state and federal organizations united
     with the common cause of increasing public awareness about the
     benefits of walking.

     <p>Regular exercise is a must for older adults if they want to
     maintain mobility and independence, Dr. Pratt said.

     <p>"Statistics show that most older adults aren't getting enough
     activity and we know that they stand to benefit from regular
     exercise," he said.

     <p>In fact, Americans in general don't get enough exercise, Dr. Pratt
     said.

     <p>According to the Report to the Surgeon General on Physical Activity
     and Health issued by the CDC in July 1996, sixty percent of
     Americans are not regularly active and 25 percent are essentially
     sedentary.

     <h>Sedentary Life Can Be Deadly

     <p>New studies are showing that sedentary lifestyles can result in
     muscle loss and significantly lowered aerobic capacity.

     <p>Researchers at the Department of Physical Education at San Diego
     State University recently completed a 23-year study involving two
     groups of middle-age men. One group exercised regularly for 23
     years. The other exercised approximately five years and then
     stopped.

     <p>When researchers tested the fitness of the men at the end of the
     study, they found those who hadn't exercised had lost 41 percent of
     their maximal aerobic power while those who exercised lost just 13
     percent. These results were interesting since decreased aerobic
     power has long been thought to be a natural product of aging.

     <p>Additionally, the researchers found that none of the men in the
     exercise group developed high blood pressure, although two men in
     this group had high blood pressure initially. In contrast, 60
     percent of the men who didn't exercise developed high blood
     pressure.

     <p>Another health bonus the researchers discovered was that the blood
     pressure of the men who exercised was 25 percent below the average
     of men their age.

     <h>Brain Power

     <p>Research has also shown exercise is good for the mind.

     <p>In a recent study at Scripps College in Claremont, Calif.,
     researchers compared 62 exercisers, ages 55 to 91, with an equal
     number of people in the same age bracket who didn't exercise to
     determine the possible effects regular activity might have on
     cognitive skills.

     <p>Both groups were given a one-hour series of tests assessing memory,
     reaction time and reasoning.

     <p>The results? The exercisers performed significantly better in all
     reaction-time tests, all reasoning tests and in two of the three
     memory tests.

     <p>"I think this study strongly suggests that exercise is important in
     preserving our mental abilities as we grow older," said Louis
     Clarkson Smith, Ph.D., who conducted the research with Alan A.
     Hartley, Ph.D.

     <h>The Benefits Of Walking

     <p>According to Partnership member Mark Fenton, "The elderly have some
     special physical concerns that can be helped with regular exercise
     like walking."

     <p>"As people get older," he said, "they seem to be at greater risk of
     developing osteoporosis and with regular exercise like walking,
     that seems to be forestalled."

     <p>Fenton, editor of the Boston-based Walking Magazine, adds that the
     psychological benefits of regular physical activity for older
     adults are immense.

     <p>"We see again and again that regular exercise gives an improved
     sense of self-worth and an improved sense of purpose," he said.
     "It's also clear that regular activity may reduce the likelihood of
     clinical depression -- a problem among the elderly who may begin to
     feel they are a burden to their family. With regular exercise, they
     can continue to be contributing members of society and if they
     want, they can get involved in volunteer work or part-time work."

     <p>Other health benefits from regular physical activity such as
     walking include:
     <l>* Reduced risk of dying prematurely
     <l>* Decreased risk of dying from heart disease
     <l>* Decreased risk of developing colon cancer
     <l>* Reduced risk of developing high blood pressure
     <l>* Help in reducing blood pressure in people who already have high
       blood pressure
     <l>* Decreased risk of developing diabetes
     <l>* Lower risk of developing hypertension
     <l>* Increased muscle strength, flexibility and sense of balance, all
       of which reduce the risk of falls
     <l>* Help in controlling weight

     <p>"I think what's really notable is just how much benefit there is
     for older adults to be physically active," DL Pratt said. "We used
     to think that once you got to a certain age, it really didn't make
     any difference anymore, but what we're finding out is that even men
     and women into their nineties can see major increases in
     cardiovascular fitness and strength with regular physical
     activity."

     <h>America's Exercise Habits

     <p>Exercise seems to be something that comes naturally to people who
     were born and raised before the automobile boom and are now in
     their eighties and nineties, according to Maggie Spilner, an editor
     for Walking magazine who has written a column on walking for the
     publication since 1988.

     <p>"My grandmother walked to work every day because she didn't know
     how to drive a car but my mother, who is now 74, drives her car
     everywhere and doesn't get any more exercise than what it takes to
     run a household," she said.

     <p>"From what I have seen, our parents have been at greater risk than
     any other generation," she said. "They were caught in the middle of
     an industrialization movement in this country."

     <p>Spilner said those who are now in their nineties relied on foot for
     the most part to get around while the generation that followed
     developed daily patterns that depended on automobiles. "Our
     generation knows enough to exercise," she said, "but the lifestyle
     of our parents sapped them of any exercise.

     <h>Preventative Medicine

     <p>What health experts have now discovered is that regular exercise
     can help prevent many of the conditions that frequently lead to a
     ride in an ambulance to the hospital, according to Dan Manz, a past
     president of the National Association of State Emergency Medical
     Service Directors, a Partner agency.

     <p>"From an emergency medical service perspective, what continues to
     be the leading ambulance call in America is cardiovascular problems
     and certainly the population that is highly at risk for that is the
     elderly," Manz said. "Clearly aerobic exercise like walking is a
     key to reducing the risk of heart attack."

     <p>Manz cautioned, however, that those with heart problems should
     check with a physician before beginning an exercise program.

     <p>According to Dr. Pratt, regular exercise can make a difference in
     the strength and endurance of older Americans.

     <p>"We've found that loss of strength and endurance that appear to be
     due to aging are really due to inactivity," he said. "Studies show
     that one in three men and half of women are completely sedentary in
     their leisure by the time they reach 75-years-old."

     <h>The Independent Life

     <p>By far the biggest difference regular exercise can make in an older
     person's life, however, is in increasing their chances of remaining
     independent and able to care for themselves, Fenton said.

     <p>"Exercise seems to be at the heart of maintaining functional
     mobility and independence and that's critical for an older person,"
     he said. "Regular exercise can mean the difference between a
     continual fulfilled life or the beginning of their demise."

     <p>Elberta Stutts, an 80-year-old retired employee of American
     Bakeries in Dorada, N.C., can attest to that.

     <p>"I walk about three and a half miles a day in my neighborhood and
     the last time I had my check-up at the doctor's office, the nurse
     said: 'From what I can tell, you have the heart of an athlete."'

     <p>What's more, Mrs. Stutts said she has gotten to know her community
     through her daily walks.

     <p>"I started walking for exercise when I quit work and I only knew
     maybe the next door neighbor or the neighbor across the street,"
     she said. "But I've gotten to know everybody in the neighborhood
     now. What's so near is that when I don't walk for a couple of days,
     my neighbors start calling me, wanting to know why I haven't been
     out walking."

     <p>Mrs. Stutts added that her daily walks keep her feeling positive
     about life.

     <p>"I can be feeling down and I can get out and walk and it helps me a
     lot to keep my head on straight," she said.

     <h>Start Now!

     <p>It might also be of interest for seniors to know that it's never
     too late to begin exercising, said Dr. Pratt.

     <p>"One of the issues with older adults, particularly with women, is
     that many have grown up thinking that exercise is not for them," he
     said. "They think if they're not athletes, they shouldn't be
     active."

     <p>"To this, I would like to say that it's never too late to start.
     Most of the benefits of exercise that accrue for younger adults
     also apply to older adults, no matter when they begin exercising,"
     he said.
