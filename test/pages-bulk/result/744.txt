   Spiritual Strength for Survival
   Finding Hope to Be Fully Alive With HIV/AIDS

   <p>By Rev. A. Stephen Pieters

   <p>1989

     <p>"This hope we have as an anchor of the soul..." -- Hebrews 6:19

<h>Introduction

     <p>Romans 8:35, 37-39. "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
     Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or
     nakedness, or peril, or sword? But in all these things we
     overwhelmingly conquer through Christ who loved us. For I am
     convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor
     principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,
     nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able
     to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus."

   <p>There is hope for people with HIV infection! We are learning to
   survive for longer periods of time. The first big step is believing
   that you can be among the (as yet) small percentage of those who are
   beating the odds. You can believe that God wants you to be healthy,
   active, and living a full quality life. You can believe that God is
   still healing people, even people with HIV! GOD IS GREATER THAN AIDS!

   <p>Longterm survival of HIV infection is becoming a greater reality with
   the development of new medical treatments. There is a great deal that
   you can do to create the conditions for your physicians' medicines to
   work, and to increase your quality of life, as well as your length of
   life.

   <p>In a paper from the University of California, San Francisco, School of
   Medicine, George F. Solomon, M.D., Lydia Temoshok, Ph.D., Ann O'Leary,
   Ph.D., and Jane Zich, Ph.D., describe "An Intensive Psychoimmunologic
   Study of Long-Surviving Persons with AIDS." The purpose of the study,
   conducted in 1987, was to understand how longterm survivors are
   different from people who follow the expected course of the disease.
   The paper states, "While the prevalent belief is that AIDS is
   invariably fatal, there is a growing number of individuals who are
   alive and well three, four, and even five years after an AIDS
   diagnosis."

   <p>A number of common factors thought to be significant to longterm
   survival were described. Here, these factors will be related to
   scriptures and spiritual principles, which serve as a guide for
   further exploration and study.

   <p>No longterm survivor perfectly fits all the attributes listed in the
   study. And illness progressed in plenty of people who followed many of
   these principles. There are no guarantees! Therefore, these principles
   should not be used as a weapon against yourself, to make your life
   more stressful than it already is; but as a guide to creating quality
   of life, as well as length of life.

<h>The Principles

   <l>1. Longterm survivors understand and accept the reality of the
   HIV/AIDS diagnosis, but also refuse to believe that the syndrome is an
   automatic, imminent death sentence.

     <p>II Corinthians 4:7-10. "But we have this treasure in earthen
     vessels, to show that the higher power belongs to God and not to
     us. We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but
     not driven to despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down,
     but not destroyed; always carrying in the body the death of Jesus,
     so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies."

   <p>All of us will die someday, and with HIV, that seems a more pressing
   reality. But in accepting the inevitability of death someday, we
   strengthen our resolve to live life more fully in the here and now.
   Thus we can acknowledge and deal realistically with the diagnosis of a
   life-threatening illness, and still maintain courage and hope to
   survive. We can believe in the promise of abundant life, shown through
   the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. You can stubbornly insist on living!

   <l>2. Longterm survivors believe that they can cope actively with the
   disease, and refuse to succumb to a "helpless-hopeless" state.

     <p>Mark 5: 25-29; 34. "And there was a woman who had had a flow of
     blood for twelve years, and who had received treatment from many
     physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better but
     rather grew worse. She had heard the reports about Jesus, and came
     up behind him in the crowd, and touched his garment. For she said,
     'If I touch even his garments, I shall be made well.' And
     immediately the bleeding ceased; and she felt in her body that she
     was healed of her disease... And Jesus said to her, 'Daughter, your
     faith has made you well; go in peace, and be healed of your
     disease.'"

   <p>Hopelessness happens when we feel helpless to do anything about our
   condition. But just as the woman in this story (a scriptural longterm
   survivor!) went to great lengths for twelve years to try and heal her
   condition, there is a lot you can do to help yourself survive for
   years! Prayer, meditation, exercise, good nutrition, getting the rest
   you need, keeping informed of the latest developments in treatment of
   HIV, staying involved, and making sure you laugh every day are steps
   that you can take towards actively coping with HIV.

   <l>3. Longterm survivors make appropriate, individualized adjustments in
   personal habits and behaviors to accommodate living with the disease.

     <p>II Corinthians 5:17. "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, that
     person is a new creation; the old has passed away; behold, the new
     has come."

   <p>When you are diagnosed with HIV, it feels like everything changes.
   Suddenly you find your perspective changing, priorities may change,
   some habits may need to be broken, and good habits formed. To be a new
   creation in Christ, living with HIV may mean examining all kinds of
   behaviors and attitudes that are keeping you from being the fully
   alive person God made you to be!

   <l>4. Longterm survivors see the physician as a collaborator, and take an
   active part in decisions related to treatment. There is a sense of
   personal responsibility for health, and a belief that they personally
   can influence the outcome of the disease.

     <p>Genesis 2:19-20. "So out of the ground God formed every beast of
     the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to the human
     to see what they would be called; and whatever the human called
     every living creature, that was its name."

   <p>One understanding of this part of the Creation story says that we
   human beings are co-creators with God: we are partners with God in
   caring for Creation. Similarly, we are co-creators with our physicians
   of our wellness. We are partners with our doctors in creating the
   conditions for healing and wellness. It is important to find a
   physician who understands this, and seeks your active participation in
   decisions related to treatment.

   <l>5. Longterm survivors show a "commitment to life": there are
   unfulfilled goals, dreams, or unfinished business.
   
     <p>Deuteronomy 30:19. "Therefore, choose life."

     <p>II Corinthians 1:8-10. "For we do not want you to be ignorant of
     the affliction we experienced... for we were so utterly, unbearably
     crushed that we despaired of life itself. We felt that we had
     received the sentence of death; but that was to make us rely not on
     ourselves but on God who raises the dead; God has delivered us from
     so deadly a peril, and God will deliver us; on God we have set our
     hope that we will be delivered again."

   <p>We believe in a God of life, as shown to us in the Resurrection of
   Jesus Christ. It is life-giving to focus on the goal of "the prize of
   the upward call of God in Christ Jesus." (Philippians 3:14) Many
   people with HIV have gone back to school to earn or finish a degree.
   Some have stayed alive with the hope created by an exciting project
   that they always wanted to do. Identify your dreams and goals and
   pursue them!

   <l>6. Longterm survivors find meaning and purpose in life and even in the
   disease itself.

     <p>II Corinthians 4:16-18. "So we do not lose heart... For this slight
     present affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory
     beyond all comparison, because we look not to the things that are
     seen, but to the things that are unseen; for the things that are
     seen are temporary, but the things that are unseen are eternal."

   <p>It is life-giving to look for the meaning in life, to ask questions
   like "Why do people suffer?" The Psalms are full of laments of people
   who keep asking where God is, or why God is allowing this to happen.
   Through much of the book of Job, Job rails against God, demanding an
   explanation from God for the seemingly pointless sufferings of his
   life. So ask the questions! Try to find answers! It is a healthy
   pursuit, and you are in good company!

   <l>7. Longterm survivors have usually had a previous experience with
   beating a life threatening illness, or overcoming difficult situations
   and events.

     <p>Romans 5: 3-5. "...We rejoice in our afflictions, knowing that
     affliction produces endurance, and endurance produces character,
     and character produces hope, and hope does not disappoint us,
     because God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy
     Spirit which has been given to us."

   <p>For those of us with HIV who are Gay or Lesbian, coming out may be the
   difficult passage that taught us we have the strength and faith to
   face life's challenges, including physical and spiritual challenges
   like HIV infection. Many people with HIV who are recovering alcoholics
   or addicts report that the tools they use to achieve and maintain
   sobriety have given them excellent coping skills for life with HIV.

   <l>8. Longterm survivors report the importance of support and information
   from other persons with HIV, and furthermore, are usually involved in
   active service to other persons with HIV.

     <p>Matthew 18:20. "For where two or three are gathered in my name,
     there shall I be also."

     <p>I Corinthians 12: 7; 26. "To each is given the evidence of the
     spirit for the common good... If one member suffers, all suffer
     together, if one member is honored, all rejoice together.

   <p>When you are newly diagnosed with HIV, there is no one who understands
   what you are going through quite like another person with HIV. The
   information network among people with HIV has for many years been one
   of the most important survival tools available. And many people have
   discovered the value of getting outside of themselves by actively
   getting involved with HIV/AIDS work. It is life-giving to be involved
   with other people, to be a part of a community, to feel you are doing
   something to help when some people expect you to feel helpless! It is
   in community that we encounter the Risen Christ.

   <l>9. Longterm survivors are assertive, can say "No," and withdraw from
   involvements when self-care becomes necessary.

     <p>Ephesians 4:26. "If you are angry, let it be without sin: Do not
     let the sun go down on your anger."

     <p>Matthew 14:23. "And after Jesus had dismissed the crowds, he went
     up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was
     there alone..."

   <p>It has long been noted that people who survive life-threatening
   illnesses against all odds are the ones who are assertive about their
   needs. This may mean getting angry and demanding your rights as a
   patient in a hospital. It may mean demanding your right to withdraw
   and nurture yourself when you need to rest. Now is the time to give
   yourself those things which feed you emotionally and spiritually, as
   well as physically.

   <l>10. Longterm survivors develop an ability to read their body,
   sensitively care for it, and communicate openly about their concerns.

     <p>II Corinthians 12:7-9. "And to keep me from being too conceited by
     the extraordinary revelations, a thorn was given to me in the
     flesh... to harass me, to keep me from being too proud. Three times
     I begged the Lord about this, that it should leave me; but God said
     to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made
     perfect in weakness.' I will all the more gladly boast of my
     weaknesses that the power of Christ may dwell in me."

   <p>Even with the best self-care program and the greatest faith, people
   with HIV experience infections and illnesses. It is important to be
   aware of the body's signals, and to be assertive about communicating
   concerns to a health care professional. Times of illness, which can
   produce great fear and anxiety, can be transformed into opportunities
   to experience God's living grace. When you're sick, it's easy to feel
   down, and wonder what you did to deserve this. But God didn't give you
   this illness. A virus did. God is with you!

     <p>Isaiah 41:10. "Fear not; I am with you. Be not dismayed; I am your
     God. I will strengthen you, I will help you, I will uphold you with
     my victorious right hand."

<h>Conclusion

   <p>More and more people are living longer and longer with HIV infection,
   and are enjoying full, exciting lives. Many people with HIV and AIDS
   have learned through their diagnosis to embrace all of life, including
   illness, and even death. And that, by God's grace, allows us to be
   joyfully alive, even with HIV infection.

   <p>It is only when we can truly embrace the inevitability of death that
   we can fully embrace the truth of the Resurrection. And that truth
   tells us that when we live with a life-threatening infection like HIV,
   we believe that the Risen Christ, Immanuel, God-with-us, is alive,
   here and now, helping us to transform our pain, fear, and anger into
   life-giving, creative action.

   <p>Look for God's grace every day. Look for evidence of the Resurrection!
   Believe in God's love for you, and in turn, share that love with
   others, and that will give you life.

   <p>To paraphrase Paul, "I am absolutely convinced that nothing in life,
   not even AIDS, not even death, can separate us from the love of God in
   Christ Jesus."

<h>A Prayer for Deliverance

     <p>Psalm 57:1. "Be gracious to me, oh God; be gracious to me, for my
     soul takes refuge in you; and in the shadow of your wings I will
     take refuge, until destruction passes by."

   <p>This was written by the Rev. Dr. Stephen Pieters, a longterm survivor
   (since 1982) of HIV infection. Although diagnosed with full-blown
   AIDS, Kaposi's Sarcoma, and lymphoma, he experienced complete
   remission of his cancers while on an experimental drug, suramin, in
   1985, and has been clinically well in all respects since 1986. Pieters
   is the Field Director of AIDS Ministry for the Universal Fellowship of
   Metropolitan Community Churches. Note: The study quoted is published
   in The Annals of The New York Academy of Science: 496: 647-655, 1987.
   Scriptural quotations are paraphrased by Rev. Pieters, based upon
   comparison of various translations.
