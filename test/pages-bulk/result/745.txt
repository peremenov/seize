   <h>The Best of "Charles Buchan's Football Monthly"
   edited by Simon Inglis 
   <p>FOR MANY FIFTY-something football fans, Charles Buchan's Football
   Monthly was a must-have throughout the year. It was an indispensible
   guide to what was happening on the pitch and on the terraces at a time
   when television wasn't exactly common currency. So this fantastic
   compilation of the best of the magazine should prove a brilliant
   stocking-filler for every grey-haired (or balding... or both) couch
   potato footie-fan in the country. A real crowd pleaser!

   <p>WHEN JESSICA RUSTON did a Google search on "heroines", she was
   disappointed at the results, so she set out to write her own book on
   the subject. And now it's getting praised everywhere. To read how
   Jessica put the book together,

   novel, A Gathering Light, was picked for last year's Richard & Judy
   Summer Read and went on to win the Carnegie Prize. She's back with a
   great new novel, The Winter Rose.
