<h>A necessary war?

   <p>Not according to U.N. monitors--or to U.S. intelligence, which has
   watched the situation even more carefully.


   <p>By John Prados
   May/June 2003  pp. 26-33 (vol. 59, no. 03) © 2003 Bulletin of the
   Atomic Scientists
<p> or months the Bush administration treated the world to a
   series of lurid claims about the military threat posed by Saddam
   Hussein's Iraq. By far the most expansive description of the threat
   was made by Secretary of State Colin Powell in his speech before the
   U.N. Security Council on February 5. In a presentation replete with
   satellite photos and artists' conceptions, Powell argued that Iraq
   posed an ominous and urgent threat.

   <p>But was the Iraqi threat as imminent as advertised? And how did these
   versions of the Iraqi menace accord with what the public had
   previously been told? And what about the Iraqi threat required the
   rush to war?

   <p>Americans in particular need to consider what it all means. Despite
   administration assertions, the threat was by no means self-evident.
   Bush officials, except where it suited their interests, have
   discounted the findings of international inspectors who for most of a
   decade monitored Iraqi weapons programs.

   <p>And how different does the picture look if one focuses instead on the
   other authoritative source on Iraqi weapons issues--the U.S.
   intelligence community, which has followed Iraqi developments at least
   as keenly as U.N. monitoring teams?


<h>A wealth of information

   <p>No classified sources were used in this analysis. The public record
   contains substantial information on intelligence findings about Iraq
   over the past decade. In part this is the result of official releases
   by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and other data provided in
   reports mandated by Congress or in annual assessments of worldwide
   threats from the director of central intelligence. Other information
   has been released in response to public controversy or Freedom of
   Information Act requests.

   <p>The intense controversy in the 1990s over Gulf War Syndrome (and the
   question of what role CIA reporting may have had on the subject) led
   to substantial CIA reports and document releases. The desire to
   ascertain the effectiveness of the U.N. monitoring programs in Iraq
   also added to the public record. Mandated intelligence reporting on
   weapons of mass destruction and on ballistic missile threats to the
   United States resulted in more additions to the record. And there have
   been the usual leaks and revelations, often from official sources in
   the Clinton and Bush administrations. As a result, there is
   surprisingly ample information with which to compare the pre-March 19
   assertions about the Iraqi threat. Because Powell's February 5
   Security Council speech became the new benchmark for U.S. perception
   of the threat, this article will take the Powell presentation as a
   point of departure.


<h>Nuclear weapons

   <p>Secretary Powell told the Security Council that "Saddam Hussein is
   determined to get his hands on a nuclear bomb," and the administration
   continued to use similarly alarmist rhetoric.  National Security
   Adviser Condoleezza Rice invoked the image of a mushroom cloud if
   Iraq's nuclear weapons were not confiscated. And on February 20,
   Powell treated an audience of high school students to the assertion
   that "Iraq does not intend to use them [nuclear weapons] for peaceful
   purposes but to be aggressive against other nations." 

   <p>These statements implied that Iraq had a nuclear weapons program (not
   to mention the means of delivering nuclear weapons). But what did U.S.
   intelligence say about that? Although Director of Central Intelligence
   George Tenet may have sat conspicuously behind Powell during Powell's
   U.N. speech--as if to lend the CIA's weight to the secretary's
   presentation--in testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on
   February 11, he could muster nothing better than the declaration that
   "Iraq has established a pattern of clandestine procurements designed
   to reconstitute its nuclear weapons program."

   <p>Last year, in its annual threat briefing, the CIA merely concluded
   that Iraq "retains a significant amount of dual-use infrastructure
   that could support a rejuvenated nuclear program."   In 2001 Tenet
   did not refer to the possibility of Iraqi nuclear weapons at all in
   his opening presentation. The year before that, his language was even
   less definitive: "Iraq probably has not given up its nuclear ambitions
   despite a decade of sanctions and inspections."  In 1999, the
   chief CIA analyst for nonproliferation, John A. Lauder, told a
   government commission that "Iraq probably has the personnel,
   documentation, and some equipment needed to continue nuclear-related
   work." 

   <p>Congress required the CIA to issue biannual reports on international
   acquisitions of technology related to weapons of mass destruction. The
   CIA's report for the first half of 2001 stated, "We believe that Iraq
   has probably continued at least low-level theoretical RandD associated
   with its nuclear program." 

   <p>But in the second half of the year, the rhetoric, if not the facts,
   changed: "Saddam's repeated publicized exhortations to his 'Nuclear
   Mujahidin' to 'defeat the enemy' added to our concerns that since the
   Gulf war Iraq has continued research and development work associated
   with its nuclear program." 

   <p>In both reports, however, Iraqi nuclear efforts were viewed with more
   concern than earlier. The October 2002 CIA white paper contained
   greater, though not more concrete, detail: "Iraq retains its cadre of
   nuclear scientists and technicians, its program documentation, and
   sufficient dual-use manufacturing capabilities to support a
   reconstituted nuclear weapons program. Iraqi media have reported
   numerous meetings between Saddam and nuclear scientists over the past
   two years, signaling Baghdad's continued interest in reviving a
   nuclear program." 

   <p>An equivalent British paper actually makes no reference to Iraq's
   nuclear program beyond the Gulf war, although it declares in its
   executive summary that Iraq "tried covertly to acquire technology and
   materials which could be used in the production of nuclear weapons."
   

   <p>So what accounted for the change between the earlier and later
   assessments? There were no significant changes in the CIA's
   intelligence sources on Iraq, and in fact there was no real change in
   what the agency was reporting. The sole difference was the degree of
   threat being attributed to the same developments. This suggests that
   political pressure led the agency to alter its analytical judgments.

   <p>Declassified documents, public sources, and U.N. weapons inspectors'
   records all show something very interesting about the Iraqi nuclear
   program: Very considerable reconstitution would be necessary to make
   it work. In fact, the CIA claimed to have discovered every facility
   that was part of the program before the Gulf war, and asserted that
   almost every facility was heavily damaged during the war. For the most
   part, what the bombs did not get, the inspectors did, according to the
   CIA. The containment structures and above-ground control rooms of the
   reactors at Tuwaitha were destroyed and have not been restored. When
   visited by new contingents of U.N. inspectors (at least six times
   since November 2002), key buildings remained blackened rubble. In his
   January 27, 2003 report to the United Nations, International Atomic
   Energy Agency head Mohamad El Baradei declared that his inspectors
   could find no evidence of an ongoing Iraqi nuclear weapons program.
   

   <p>Most of Secretary Powell's discussion of nuclear issues at the
   Security Council focused on the acquisition of weapons-grade material.
   The dispute over whether Iraq had attempted to acquire aluminum tubes
   to use in the construction of gas centrifuges is fairly well known. In
   fact, the CIA and other agencies are well aware that new materials are
   vital if any weapon is to be crafted. Every one of the reports quoted
   above emphasized this need. The October 2002 CIA white paper projected
   that indigenous production of uranium ore, if it could be combined
   with a successfully established enrichment program, would permit Iraq
   to create "a deliverable nuclear weapon" some time in the second half
   of this decade. The agency claimed that Iraq could build a bomb within
   a year with material from foreign sources, but said that avenue had
   been closed by the existing sanctions regime.   Before the Gulf
   war, the CIA believed Iraq was on track to produce 100--125 kilograms
   of highly enriched uranium a year--if it built a cascade of some 5,000
   gas centrifuges.   The Iraqis had worked with electromagnetic
   separation, and had succeeded before the war in enriching some uranium
   in this way, but the program never reached industrial scale. Soon
   after the war, the CIA established that the Iraqis had actually
   produced only 3--10 kilograms before August 1990, using all separation
   methods combined--at least one reason why Saddam's "crash program" to
   develop a weapon during the course of the Gulf war, was a failure.
    No enrichment program on such a scale exists today. One
   newspaper report in 1999 claimed that Iraq had set up a gaseous
   diffusion plant at Al Ubur, but neither the CIA, the British, nor
   Secretary Powell made any charges regarding such a facility. 


<h>Biological weapons

   <p>The greatest fears seem to be attached to Iraqi efforts to create
   biological weapons. In his U.N. speech, Powell argued that Baghdad
   resisted admitting to having biologicals for four years after the Gulf
   war, that these weapons are very destructive, and that Iraq had never
   accounted for its existing weapons. In 1995, Iraq declared it had
   produced 8,500 liters of anthrax, but inspectors estimated that it
   could have produced 25,000 liters, and that there were at one time 400
   bombs filled with the agent. "This is evidence, not conjecture," the
   secretary said. "This is true."

   <p>On the other hand, in George Tenet's worldwide threat briefings in
   2000, Iraq was simply lumped in with a dozen other states thought
   either to possess or to be actively pursuing biological weapons. In
   2001, no specific mention was made of biologicals, which were instead
   lumped together with all weapons of mass destruction. Of Iraq, the CIA
   director simply declared: "Our most serious concern with Saddam
   Hussein must be the likelihood that he will seek a renewed WMD
   capability."

   <p>Tenet also commented significantly on intent: Iraq, he said, sought a
   bioweapons capacity "both for credibility and because every other
   strong regime in the region either has it or is pursuing it."   He
   made no claims about Iraq attacking either the United States or a
   neighboring state. In both 2000 and 2001, the CIA emphasized Iraq's
   deteriorating economic situation.

   <p>In 2002 the briefing suggested that Iraq was continuing to build and
   expand its infrastructure for producing undifferentiated weapons of
   mass destruction. Not until the white paper of October 2002 does the
   CIA mention thousands of liters of biological agents, or offer a map
   of Iraqi research and production facilities.

   <p>Interestingly enough, that white paper tied the Iraqi admission of
   biological programs to the 1995 defection of Saddam's son-in-law
   Hussein Kamel, but U.S. intelligence had all along been aware of
   Iraq's bioweapons efforts. Gulf war documents contain dozens of
   reports and cables detailing every aspect of the Iraqi program, and
   they discussed all but a couple of the Iraqi research and production
   installations. In other words, U.S. intelligence reports before 2002
   were made in full knowledge of the Iraqi biological infrastructure.
   (Incidentally, the British intelligence paper complementing the CIA's
   October 2002 report actually accepted the Iraqi figure for its stock
   of anthrax, suggesting no production between 1995 and 2003.) Moreover,
   none of the recent alarmist claims mentioned the possible degradation
   of bioweapon stocks.

   <p>Much was made in the Powell speech of precursor chemicals and mobile
   laboratories. Clearly Iraq's potential for production depended on
   means and mechanisms. If every drop of growth medium and germ could be
   utilized to grow toxic spores, Saddam's stocks would have been
   considerably enlarged. However, no one should make the mistake of
   supposing that the alleged mobile laboratories could have produced
   agents on the scale of fixed installations or with equivalent purity
   and quality. Permissible temperature ranges, isolation requirements,
   and handling problems would all constrain operations in mobile labs.
   Powell suggested that Iraq had seven laboratories on wheels; if so,
   they would have had only a tiny fraction of the capacity of fixed
   industrial plants.

   <p>Gulf war documents indicate that before August 1990 Iraq was producing
   1,000 tons a year of biologicals. The numbers cited most recently by
   both U.S. and British sources (for anthrax, botulinum, and other
   biological weapons) added up to just a few dozen tons. Observers can
   agree that bioweapons are Iraq's most dangerous weapons, but stocks
   are limited and means of delivery are another issue. The use of
   biologicals in the absence of robust stocks of antidotes and
   countermeasures would be worse than stupid--and no charges were made
   that Saddam had stockpiled antidotes.


<h>Chemical weapons

   <p>Aside from Iraq's use of deception to preserve its programs, Secretary
   Powell and others have used Saddam's chemical weapons programs to
   substantiate their claims of an imminent Iraqi threat. Because Iraq
   actually did use chemical weapons during its war with Iran in the
   1980s, and is widely believed to have used them against the Kurds at
   home, assertions that chemical weapons posed an active threat were
   credible and easy to make. At the United Nations, Colin Powell raised
   the previous use of chemical agents, added that Iraq had never
   accounted for vast amounts of its chemical weapons, and said that
   Baghdad's declarations on the subject were replete with lies. The
   conservative U.S. estimate, Powell told the Security Council, was that
   Iraq retained between 100 and 500 tons of chemical agents.

   <p>Director Tenet told the Senate Foreign Relations committee in 2000
   that "we assume [Saddam] continues to attach high priority to
   preserving a WMD infrastructure."  The CIA's report on
   proliferation of weapons of mass destruction for the first half of
   that year fleshed this out by stating that after the Desert Fox
   bombing of Iraq that took place at the end of 1998, after Saddam ended
   all U.N. weapons inspections, "Baghdad again instituted a
   reconstitution effort on those facilities destroyed by U.S. bombing,
   including several critical missile production complexes and former
   dual-use CW [chemical weapons] production facilities."   The
   agency worried that discrepancies in Iraqi reporting indicated that
   Saddam might have hidden up to 6,000 chemical munitions from U.N.
   inspectors. The CIA's report for the second half of the year repeated
   that concern, but only asserted: "We assess that, since December 1998,
   Iraq has increased its capability to pursue chemical warfare (CW)
   programs." 

   <p>Analysts mentioned the rebuilding of facilities and Iraq's efforts in
   international markets to procure dual-use items that could be adapted
   to chemical weapons production, not an active weapons program. When
   the CIA answered questions for the record after Tenet's 2002 worldwide
   threat briefing, their formulation downplayed the issue: "Baghdad is
   expanding its chemical industry in ways that could be diverted quickly
   to CW agent production." None of these reports claimed that Iraq was
   actually producing chemical weapons. But in the agency's October 2002
   white paper, although the discussion portion of the study used similar
   language, the judgments section baldly declared: "Baghdad has begun
   renewed production of chemical warfare agents, probably including
   mustard, sarin, cyclosarin, and VX."  The numbers Powell used in
   February 2003, 100--500 tons, are identical to those in the October
   CIA report.

   <p>Intelligence assessments and reporting during and after the Gulf war
   provide important perspective on these projections. For one thing, the
   Iraqi stockpile was nothing like what it was in the past. According to
   the CIA's own estimates, Iraq was producing chemical agents at a rate
   of 2,000 tons per year by the end of the Iraq-Iran war in 1988, and
   that rate was projected to reach 4,000 tons by 1993.   One plant
   alone--Samarra--was manufacturing 720 tons of mustard gas and 96 of VX
   annually.  The size of the Iraqi stockpile at the start of the
   Gulf war was put at 1,000 tons. Whatever Iraqi capabilities were in
   2002, they did not reach that level.

   <p>The threat-mongering also said nothing about the longevity of the
   Iraqi stockpile. At the time of the Gulf war, the CIA and Defense
   Intelligence Agency disputed the shelf life of Iraqi chemical agents.
   Although the storage problem had no doubt been solved in part by the
   creation of binary weapons (weapons whose components are not mixed
   together until use), a number of the Gulf war documents attested to
   Baghdad's continuing difficulties with ensuring the purity and
   stability of precursor chemicals and the integrity of the
   manufacturing process. Iraqi technology may have improved in 2003, but
   the need to carry on a program under a microscope, as it were, would
   have had negative effects on production quality as well.

   <p>Finally, there is the question of actual use on the battlefield.
   Blanketing a combat theater with chemical agents consumes large
   quantities of materials. One CIA analysis early in the Gulf war
   concluded that 600 tons of new agent, combined with leftover
   materials, would probably suffice for about a week of high-intensity
   fighting.   At that rate, the 500-ton stockpile estimated before
   March would last less than six days. Chemical weapons should be seen
   as tactical weapons. It will be tragic if the mechanism chosen to
   force Iraq to give up its chemical arsenal is to induce Baghdad to use
   its chemical weapons against an invading army.


<h>Delivery and usage

   <p>Year after year Iraqi missiles have been discussed in some detail in
   intelligence reports. As with weapons of mass destruction in general,
   there was a body of wider-ranging reports on world developments that
   include Iraq. A national intelligence estimate (NIE) was done in 1995
   and another in December 2001. Other reports went to Congress in
   September 1999 and again at the end of 2001 (an unclassified version
   of the NIE).

   <p>The 1995 NIE was attacked by proponents of missile defenses and by
   Israeli sources, both of whom pointed to an Iranian threat. The CIA
   had assessed that a missile threat to the continental United States
   was unlikely before 2015. After its assessment was attacked, the CIA
   set up a review panel led by former CIA director Robert M. Gates; that
   panel saw no problem with the assessment.

   <p>Congress then set up a commission on missile threats under
   then-private citizen Donald Rumsfeld. The "Rumsfeld commission"
   concluded in July 1998 that the missile threat had been greatly
   underestimated, and the pressure caused by the commission's report was
   reflected in the 1999 paper by the National Intelligence Council
   (NIC), the same body responsible for the NIEs.

   <p>The 1999 NIC paper held that much of Iraq's missile infrastructure had
   been destroyed in the Gulf War, but that Baghdad "could" test a
   missile capable of reaching the United States within a few years using
   either Scud technology or something based on its Al Abbas design
   (identified as a space launch vehicle) or on a North Korean rocket.
     Robert D. Walpole, the national intelligence officer for
   strategic weapons, noted that analysts were all over the map when it
   came to predicting the date for a test flight. These differences
   persisted in the 2001 NIE, which noted that "most agencies . . .
   believe that Iraq is unlikely to [test an intercontinental ballistic
   missile] even if the [U.N.] prohibitions are lifted." Instead, the NIE
   concluded, Baghdad would reconstitute its Scud force to pre--Gulf war
   levels and design some sort of medium-range missile. The NIE noted the
   U.S. belief that Iraq had retained a covert force of extended-range
   Scuds, which Baghdad called Al Husseins. 

   <p>This covert Scud force grew to greater proportions in the October 2002
   CIA white paper, which listed both the Al Abbas and the Al Hussein.
   The Al Hussein was described as having been flight-tested between 1988
   and 1990, but the paper did not mention that in both the 1999 and 2001
   NIEs the test was described as a failure. The white paper claimed that
   Iraq has developed medium-range (up to 3,000 kilometer) "concepts,"
   and developed the Badr-2000, a two-stage missile with an estimated
   range of 750--1,000 kilometers. The CIA's technology acquisition
   report for the last half of 2001 cited facilities for solid-propellant
   casting, saying that "we can find no logical explanation for the size
   and configuration of these mixing buildings other than an Iraqi
   intention to develop longer-range, prohibited missiles (that is, to
   mix solid propellant exclusively geared for such missiles)." 
   This was repeated in the white paper.

   <p>Secretary Powell's U.N. speech went even further; Powell claimed Iraq
   had huge engine-testing stands, and accused it of pursuing a
   1,200-kilometer-range system.

   <p>No evidence--other than a photo of an engine test stand--was presented
   to support the claim for the development of medium-or long-range
   missiles. Baghdad had no flight test program and had not built any
   hardware. Nor had it ever been demonstrated that a covert force of Al
   Abbas Scud variants in fact existed, though observers may want to give
   the administration the benefit of the doubt on that score. (Space
   precludes a discussion of the Iraqi unmanned aerial vehicle program,
   except to say its existence had been known from at least the early
   1990s. Only recently has the program been viewed with alarm.)

   <p>Unmentioned in any of this were the Al Abbas's serious in-flight
   stability problems. Longer atmospheric re-entry at extended range,
   higher temperatures, greater acceleration, all impact on the Scud
   airframe, a nearly 50-year-old design. These pressures caused more
   missiles to break up than were intercepted by Patriot anti-ballistic
   missiles in 1990--91. Several of the CIA Gulf war documents record
   their poor performance. Since the systems were now prohibited, Iraq
   could not conduct flight tests to correct the problems. Using the same
   Scud technology as the basis for a medium-range missile would have
   been foolhardy at best. Iraq had no experience with a two-stage or
   larger rocket.

   <p>The short-range Al Samoud missile had been listed in CIA reports as
   exceeding the permitted 150-kilometer range for some time. Reports on
   weapons of mass destruction note the transporter/launchers for the
   rocket and its solid-fuel counterpart had been paraded on recent
   ceremonial occasions in Baghdad. In late February, Iraq agreed to
   destroy the missiles. About half the known forces of these missiles
   were destroyed before the United States began its war against Iraq.


<h>Use 'em or lose 'em?

   <p>Finally there was the question of Saddam's intent to use whatever
   weapons he may have had. The Gulf war documents make clear there was
   close control over the Iraqi arsenal. Kamel told the CIA in 1995 that
   the use of weapons of mass destruction had been raised several times
   within the Iraqi high command, but always rejected.   Saddam was
   cited elsewhere as believing the United States would have retaliated
   with tactical nuclear weapons if he had used his biological ones.
    The agency itself concluded that Saddam considered the biologicals
   his strategic retaliatory force. Most recently, on October 7, 2002,
   Director Tenet sent a letter to the Senate Intelligence Committee
   declassifying the "senior intelligence witness's" statement that in
   response to a U.S.-initiated attack that put Saddam in danger of
   defeat, the chances of his use of weapons of mass destruction were
   "pretty high, in my view." 

   <p>What is clear from intelligence reporting is that until about 1998 the
   CIA was fairly comfortable with its assessments on Iraq, but from that
   time on the agency gradually buckled under the weight of pressures to
   adopt alarmist views. In fact, the looming threat of the
   day--Iran--has gradually been eclipsed even though it, like North
   Korea, had--and has--more questionable and more highly developed
   programs in several areas than had Iraq. [See "Iran: Furor over Fuel,"
   by David Albright and Corey Hinderstein, p. 12.]

   <p>After mid-2001 the rush to judgment on Iraq became a stampede. It is
   fair to suspect that CIA analysts did not approve of the cast being
   given to their reporting.

   <p>Conversely, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld had little real need to create
   his own in-house intelligence staff to furnish threat information on
   Iraq--George Tenet's CIA had already been hounded into doing just
   that. The Iraqi threat was nothing like the Soviet one, but
   intelligence had been manipulated just the same.
