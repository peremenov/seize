<h>FIRE Letter to Princeton President Shirley M. Tilghman, April 19, 2005
       <p>April 19, 2005

       <p>President Shirley M. Tilghman
       Office of the President
       1 Nassau Hall
       Princeton University
       Princeton, New Jersey 08544

                                   <p>URGENT
        
       <p>Sent by U.S. Mail and Facsimile (609-258-1615)

       <p>Dear President Tilghman:

       <p>As you can see from our Directors (including FIRE co-founders and
       Princeton University alumni Alan Charles Kors and Harvey
       Silverglate) and Board of Advisors, FIRE unites civil rights and
       civil liberties leaders, scholars, journalists, and public
       intellectuals across the political and ideological spectrum on
       behalf of liberty, due process, legal equality and--in the matter
       of the Princeton Faith and Action student group--voluntary
       association, freedom of speech, and religious liberty on America's
       college campuses.  Our web page, thefire.org, will give you a
       better sense of our identity and activities.

       <p>We consider this matter to be of the utmost urgency, with the most
       essential legal and moral values at stake.  We understand that
       Princeton University has refused to approve recognition for a
       Christian student organization, Princeton Faith and Action (PFA),
       because: (1) the group is affiliated with an outside religious
       organization not recognized for chaplaincy by the university and
       (2) the dean of religious life believes that the members of PFA
       can work with already existing groups that do "similar things."
       FIRE also understands that Princeton requires all religious
       student groups that seek to gain official recognition get an
       arbitrary "approval" from the dean of religious life before being
       permitted to apply for recognition.  These violations of
       Princeton's own written guarantees of freedom of speech,
       association, and religion are inexcusable at one of the nation's
       leading liberal arts institutions.

       <p><p>The following is our understanding of the facts, drawn from
       student reports and other sources.  Please correct any factual
       errors, if they exist.  Matt Bennett is the founder and president
       of Christian Union, a non-profit ministry founded in 2002
       that is dedicated to working with and providing resources to
       Christian and non-Christian students at the eight Ivy League
       universities.  Between January of 2002 and the autumn of 2004,
       Bennett had corresponded with Dean of Religious Life Thomas
       Breidenthal to discuss the process of attaining recognition for
       Christian Union as a campus chaplaincy at Princeton.  During their
       correspondence, Dean Breidenthal never gave Christian Union an
       opportunity to submit an official application for chaplaincy as
       outlined in the university's "Policy Statement Regarding
       Recognition of Campus Ministers," nor was the group's potential
       for chaplaincy evaluated based on the criteria listed in that
       policy.

       In September of 2004, Dean Breidenthal informed the Reverend
       Richard Linderman, a Christian Union Advisory Board member, that
       he had decided not to recognize Christian Union for chaplaincy.
       Dean Breidenthal stated that the reasons for this decision were
       that: (1) Christian Union was a relatively new organization and
       needed to develop a track record; (2) another campus chaplain had
       complained about Christian Union scheduling a Bible study at the
       same time as one of that chaplain's meetings; and (3) Christian
       Union had met with Vice President of Campus Life Janet Dickerson
       without first notifying Dean Breidenthal.

       <p>During January to February of 2005, Manna Christian Fellowship
       (MCF), a recognized student group, attempted to reserve a room on
       campus to host a Sunday morning event as part of an April
       conference organized by the Christian Union in Princeton, New
       Jersey.  Dean Breidenthal informed MCF that it could not host
       Christian Union's Sunday event because it would be a "violation of
       University policy" to reserve the room for an "outside group."
       Dean Breidenthal instead directed MCF to tell Christian Union to
       reserve a room through Princeton's Conference Services.  Christian
       Union attempted to do so, but its request was denied because
       Conference Services required that the organization have prior
       approval from the dean of religious life.

       <p>Since Christian Union could neither attain recognition as a
       chaplaincy nor reserve spaces on campus, by March of 2005
       Princeton students associated with Christian Union had organized
       into a group called Princeton Faith and Action (PFA) in order to
       seek recognition as an official student organization.  When the
       group's leaders approached the Student Government Student Group
       Recognition Committee (SGRC) to apply for official recognition,
       they were instructed to meet with Dean Breidenthal to get his
       approval first.

       <p>On April 7, 2005, Cameron Young and Rachel Blair, the president
       and treasurer of PFA, respectively, met with Dean Breidenthal to
       discuss recognition for PFA.  At the meeting, Dean Breidenthal
       denied PFA approval to apply for recognition with the SGRC.  His
       reasons were that (1) recognizing PFA would mean "recognizing
       Christian Union de facto" and (2) the members of PFA could engage
       in similar activities with existing campus religious groups.

       <p>When the students asked Dean Breidenthal why recognizing Christian
       Union would be a problem, he told them that the issue was
       "confidential" and refused to discuss it.  He further told them
       that he did not want PFA to become an "arm of the Christian Union
       on campus."  When the students pointed out that other religious
       student organizations existed on campus without corresponding
       recognized chaplaincies, the dean stated that his hope was for
       such groups (such as the Seventh-Day Adventists and the Muslim
       student group) to eventually become campus ministries with
       full-time chaplains.

       <p>The dean suggested that, as an alternative, the students work with
       MCF to organize their activities.  According to the students, when
       they explained that they already attempted to do so, the dean
       responded: "Not Christian Union conferences.  I don't want you to
       be a way for Christian Union to hold their conferences on
       campus."

       <p>At the close of the meeting, the students expressed concern that
       requiring religious student groups to gain special approval was
       discriminatory since other student groups do not have the same
       requirements.  The dean's response was that this was "the way
       things were done" at Princeton.

       <p>Dean Breidenthal's decision to forbid PFA from associating with
       the ministry of its choice denies PFA members the right of free
       association and threatens the freedoms of association and religion
       of all of Princeton's students.  Furthermore, Dean Breidenthal's
       decision appears to have been based on an earlier decision to not
       recognize Christian Union for reasons entirely unrelated to the
       normal procedure for recognizing a ministry for campus
       chaplaincy.

       <p>Princeton's "Policy Statement Regarding Recognition of Campus
       Ministers" states that:

     <p>Princeton University seeks to promote the presence of a vigorous
     and diverse religious community on campus, to foster interfaith
     dialogue, understanding and co-operation within that community, and
     to encourage its active participation in the public discourse of
     the University. To this end, Princeton University welcomes the
     presence of a wide range of denominational and non-denominational
     ministries reflecting all faiths and religious traditions.
     
       <p>The policy further states that:

     <p>All applications for recognition originate from a religious
     council, church or other religious body. The University does not
     consider applications from individuals. The sending agency submits
     its application in writing to the Dean of the Chapel and of
     Religious Life, along with a resumé of the individual it is
     nominating, a written commitment to pay his or her salary as campus
     minister, and evidence of medical insurance. Recognition is
     conferred by the Dean, in consultation with the Vice-President for
     Campus Life. 
       <p>Christian Union was not given the opportunity to send an
       application as detailed in the policy.  In fact, it would have
       been futile to do so, since Dean Breidenthal had already made it
       clear in conversations and in several emails that he would not
       consider Christian Union for recognition.  As he stated in a
       February 21, 2005, email, "authoriz[ing] use of a campus venue
       [for Christian Union's conference]...would not be consonant with
       this office's decision not to recognize Christian Union as a
       Princeton University Ministry."  This revealing statement
       indicates that Dean Breidenthal had ruled out a chaplaincy for
       Christian Union before the group had even submitted an
       application.

       <p>This ongoing violation of the freedom of association and religious
       liberty of Princeton's religious students is unconscionable in
       light of the clear statements protecting students' rights in the
       university's statement on "Rights, Rules and Responsibilities."
       If Dean Breidenthal is right and this is indeed "the way things
       are done" at Princeton, the university is in violation of its own
       policies on "Campus Associations and Activities," which promise
       that:

     <p>Students engaging in extracurricular activities on campus are free
     to form organizations devoted to a wide variety of objectives, and,
     as individuals or members of organizations, to express their views
     on issues of University and public interest.... University
     recognition will not be withheld from any group pursuing lawful
     objectives merely because its aims may seem unorthodox. 
       <p>Dean Breidenthal's apparently arbitrary method of decision-making
       simply cannot be reconciled with Princeton's promises.

       <p>Princeton's policies also state that:

     <p>Student organizations may invite outside speakers of their choice,
     and are free to hold meetings and in other ways to express their
     views, subject only to prudent conditions regarding the protection
     of people and property and to reasonable regulations concerning
     time, place, and notice of meetings and other public exercises....
     These policies are intended to safeguard the rights of students and
     student organizations to freedom of association.        
<p>Dean Breidenthal's prohibition on MCF's hosting Christian Union
       for a Sunday conference event on campus violates the guarantee to
       student organizations that they may "invite outside speakers of
       their choice."  Instead of "safeguard[ing] the rights of students
       and student organizations to freedom of association," Princeton's
       actions have threatened the rights at least two religious groups
       on campus.  Indeed, the fact that religious student groups must
       obtain the arbitrary approval of Dean Breidenthal grants him the
       power to censor religious groups without restriction or recourse.
       Non-religious student groups are not required to undergo such an
       administrative litmus test in order to apply for recognition.
       This policy constitutes a shameful and illiberal double standard.

       <p>If Princeton is to allow expressive organizations to exist on its
       campus at all, it should allow religious organizations to exist,
       to define their missions, to select their own members, and to
       establish policies, practices, and associations with other groups
       in pursuit of their goals.  No group can control the delivery of
       its message if it is unable to determine its expressive purpose,
       membership, and activities.  This principle is explained well by
       the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Boy Scouts of America v.
       Dale, 530 U.S. 640 (2000).  In this decision, the Court pointed
       out that "implicit in the right to engage in activities protected
       by the First Amendment is a corresponding right to associate with
       others in pursuit of a wide variety of political, social,
       economic, educational, religious, and cultural ends."  This right,
       the Court proclaimed, is "crucial in preventing the majority from
       imposing its views on groups that would rather express other,
       perhaps unpopular, ideas."

       <p>In addition, the Court has ruled that public institutions are
       required to grant religious organizations equal access to campus
       facilities (see Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263 (1981)), and are
       also required to grant religious organizations equal access--on a
       viewpoint neutral basis--to student fee funding.  See Rosenberger
       v. University of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819 (1995) and Board of
       Regents v. Southworth, 529 U.S. 217 (2000).  As a private
       institution with policies guaranteeing freedom of association on
       campus, Princeton should follow the Court's example in protecting
       the same fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment,
       lest students at one of the nation's most prestigious universities
       be left with fewer rights than they would have had at their local
       community college.

       <p>Princeton should be aware that FIRE has successfully concluded
       religious liberty and freedom of association cases at other
       private universities facing similar situations.  For example, at
       the Catholic University of America (CUA), FIRE defended the right
       of students to organize an NAACP chapter on campus after CUA
       attempted to prevent its recognition by claiming its existence
       would be "redundant" and that it would violate the university's
       adherence to Catholic beliefs by being "pro-choice."  After FIRE
       reminded CUA of its obligation to legal equality and its own
       promises of students' rights to freedom of association, CUA
       decided to recognize the NAACP student chapter.  You may wish to
       read more about FIRE's efforts to defend free speech, religious
       freedom, and freedom of association on these and other campuses
       across the nation at thefire.org.

       <p>FIRE requests that Princeton University act immediately to correct
       this ongoing injustice by officially recognizing Princeton Faith
       and Action as well as any other faith-based groups that may have
       been denied the right to recognition by the dean of religious life
       for similar reasons.  Only by doing this can Princeton restore to
       its students the essential rights of freedom of religion and
       association guaranteed by its own policies.  FIRE furthermore
       requests that Princeton administrators review the institution's
       legal and moral obligations to treat expressive student
       organizations equally and according to the university's promises.
       Honoring the rights and dignities of its students does not mean
       that Princeton endorses the particular message or associations of
       any particular student group--it signifies only that the
       university recognizes and respects the basic liberties that belong
       to all of its students.

       <p>We hope to see this matter resolved with fairness, common sense,
       and respect for the principle of legal equality.  Because of the
       urgency of this situation and the continuing violation of
       religious students' rights, we request that you that you respond
       to us by 5 p.m. on Tuesday, April 26, 2005.

       <p>Sincerely,

      <p> David French
       President
