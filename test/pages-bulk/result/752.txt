   <p>No Tahoe in the lot. Which was bullcrap. Because only on-duty officers
   were supposed to drive the Tahoe, and he was the on-duty officer, so
   somebody had the Tahoe who wasnt supposed to have it, as in, namely,
   Ravel, who moonlighted in it, and was still moonlighting in it even
   after the chief plainly said, You dont take the Tahoe moonlighting.
   Because Ravel thought this was cornpone Mayberry, where any old junior
   officer could yuk it up with the chief over trifling matters such as
   insubordination of a commanding officers direct order. Well, Chief had
   better start taking his own orders seriously or he was going to find
   his department short one officer, as in, namely, him, Piper Doyle.
   That is, the sole officer on this force with a bachelors degree (and
   two graduate credits) from a major, fully accredited land grant
   universityand by degree is not meant some flypaper
   okay-you-passed-now-get-the-hell-out-of-here diploma in criminal
   justice (oxymoron), no, but instead the bona fide cum laude in genuine
   psychology. Forget it. Done. Over. Out. Pushing thirty, and why the
   hell stay in Ballson anyway? Looking to make chief? Not anytime soon,
   not anytime ever, with Ravel around, little junior-officer golden boy,
   fair-haired wonderchild. Asshole. Taking the Tahoe moonlighting. And
   probably moonlighting in uniform, which is to say, impersonating an
   on-duty officer. Officer Ravel at large, padding his salary with
   henchman work for tort lawyers and bail bondsmen. Taking the Tahoe.
   And right after the storm of the season blew all hell into this town,
   snapping limbs and shredding saplings like paper targets all up and
   down Second Street.
   <p>Doyle drove past the courthouse and behind the station.
   <p>Nope, no Ravel car in the lot, either. Nice moveso the chief wont
   drive by and see it. Probably rode his shiny new bike down to HQ,
   stole the keys to the Tahoe, threw said bike in back and took off for
   a night of against-orders moonlighting. Even Ravels bike was
   department issue. The kid was spoiled as a black banana. So he came up
   with the idea for Bike Copbig deal! So he personally pitched the plan
   to the chief and mayor, wrote the proposal, figured up a budget. It
   was only so he could spend his summers pedaling down Riverfront Drive,
   mixing with the cruising kids, patrolling the park on weekends,
   checking for booze and reefer. Talk about cushyshort pants and a Lycra
   T, flexing his biceps for sixteen-year-old sun goddesses slathered in
   baby oil. Call that police work? So what if the public likes its
   enviro-friendly Bike Cop. Public approval of a bicycle is not carte
   blanche. You dont take the Tahoe off duty. What would the public think
   of that? Is a Tahoe enviro-friendly? No. You dont take it. But Ravel
   had, and now the on-duty officer, he, Doyle, would have to work his
   shift in one beat-to-hell-ass Caprice prowler, a wreck with so many
   miles on it, driven so hard by the third-shift Turks that its
   transmission will practically slam said on-duty officer through the
   filthy goddamn windshield. Ten bucks nobody filled the tank either.

   <p>Parked in his spot beside the impound lot, Doyle took his pressed
   uniform from the backseat. This evening smelled ominously similar to
   the previous night, just before the funnel cloud swooped down from
   nowhere to dance across the river then vanish just as freakishly, as
   if its sole mission had been to cover Riverfront Drive with the six
   tons of river wrack it had inhaled over Gavin Slough. The sky again
   glowed a yellowish green. Air pressure felt low, too. Yes, something
   definitely was headed this way. The kind of thing you dont, in
   particular, want to drive through in a Caprice with ninety thousand
   whose windshield hadnt tasted fresh wiper in half of that.
   <p>The station door felt almost icy against his hand as he stepped into
   the air-conditioned chill of the lobby, where Kevin Will worked the
   operations desk. Will was processing forms and playing along with
   Jeopardy on the little set next to the watercooler.
   <p>Piper! Whats happening? Will raised his fist in the Black Power salute
   that recently had become the greeting of choice of the all-white BPD.
   Chief wants you down in South Ballson checking on old man Filcher
   first chance you get.
   <p>Doyle stood, his uniform on the hanger over his shoulder, his face
   motionless behind his aviator sunglasses. Their green lenses now hid
   the fresh swell of hatred his heart dished out in quick and equal
   portions for Ravel, the chief, and his own judgment, saving a small
   slice for Kevin Will as well. Probably hurricane-grade T-storms would
   be kicking this towns butt any minute, and the chief wanted him to
   take a prowler to South Ballson, under the viaduct? Idiotic. How could
   a department survive under so poor a chief? A man ignorant of his
   officers talents and stupid enough to insist on the superiority of the
   associates degree in criminal justice over the bona fide bachelors in
   psychology from a fully accredited land grant school. This is law
   enforcement, Doyle. CJ is whats best. The ignoramus. And to season the
   wound, Now, I know how highly you think of your education, and I know
   you did an experiment
   <p>on a rat out in Iowa City. But this is BPD. We dont handle rats here.
   You want Animal Control.
   <p>Doyle kept his shades on in the dim of the tinted-glass lobby and
   stared down at Kevin Will. Its going to pour any minute, and Im
   supposed to take a prowler under the viaduct into SB? Last night that
   tunnel had thirty inches of water. Wheres the Tahoe?
   <p>Wills face pinched as he concentrated on Jeopardy. He raised a finger
   to let Doyle know he was interrupting. Ravel. Special Ops.
   Doyle squeezed the tip of the clothes hanger into the flesh of his
   palm. Special Ops.
   <p>Rising in his seat, the kid smacked his desk and shouted, What is
   psychology! On-screen, a contestant buzzed in, What is behaviorism?
   Sonofabitch! He snapped a pencil between his fingers.
   <p>Doyle leaned over the front desk, tapping the counter with his keys.
   Listen, I know youre relatively new here, Will, but when Officer Ravel
   tells you he needs the Tahoe for Special Ops or Interdiction Unit or
   Commissioners Task Force or whatever crap he comes up withWill, you
   listening to me?because when he tells you that, he is lying. All
   right? And hes making a jackass of you to boot.
   <p>Will leaned forward and adjusted the antennae. Chief never said
   anything.
   <p>Well, Im saying something. And Im your senior, right? As in, I will be
   on your three-year review.
   <p>Will barely nodded. So will Ravel. He thrust a finger at the screen.
   What is the brain! A contestant buzzed in, What is the hippocampus? He
   wet a finger on his tongue and tallied a point in the air. Close
   enough!
   <p>An idiot, yes, but Will was only the messenger. This was the chiefs
   doing, and the second such offense in as many days. Yesterday thered
   been the matter of Doyles request for airfare to the National Police
   Shooting Championships in Jackson, Mississippia perfectly completed
   requisition that the chief had denied summarily, as if the whole thing
   hadnt been his idea in the first place, as if hed never suggested the
   trip himself back when hed appointed Doyle custodian of the firing
   range: Seeing how youre down there every night anyway, the chief had
   said, raising an eyebrow at the log of Doyles nightly shooting sprees.
   He gave Doyle the key to the range and regarded him from below the
   thick folds of his eyelids. You ought to take all this training to the
   National Police Shooting Championships down in Jackson, Mississippi.
   Make the department proud. A fairly unambiguous invitation. Until
   Doyle submitted the travel voucher, and the old man acted as if hed
   never heard of the NPSC, as if hed never in his life spoken the words
   Jackson, Mississippi. He did tell Doyle to hang onto the range key
   when Doyle angrily tried to return it. Oh, I know how you like to
   shoot, Doyle. The chief raised his own key ring to indicate it was too
   full already. Yes, youre a regular His face struggled to name a great
   marksman. Jesse James!
   <p>The best thing now was just to get away from the station, to get out
   on the beat. Friday night meant domestic disputes and field sobriety
   tests, the welcome solitude of a solo patrol. Plus, at shifts end he
   could retreat to the range and release this stress on the departments
   new moving-targets carousel, a small family of revolving steel
   silhouettes its manufacturer dubbed One Hostile Posse.
   <p>The Filcher matter was first on the docket. Doyle turned the muddy
   Caprice off the lot and headed south on Second Avenue. A routinely
   disorderly alcoholic, Filcher had left his house after last nights
   twister to find his beagle with its leash wound so tightly around the
   tree hed chained it to that he needed bolt cutters to free the corpse.
   Filcher had a lengthy record as both a drinker and what the department
   called a moderate-to-severe EDP (emotionally disturbed person). The
   disturbed, thats who Doyle dealt with while Ravel patrolled picnickers
   in the park. The station got the call last night after Filchers rage
   drew a mob of rubberneckers to his property. Filcher spat foam,
   dragging the dead animal by the choke chain, convinced that someone
   had stolen onto his property and murdered the beast, despite the
   twister having torn out half the tree.
   <p>The prowler groaned up out of the viaduct into South Ballson and the
   first burst of rain pounded its windshield. Maybe hed resorted to a
   cheap shot in handling Filcher last night, invoking the poor mans dead
   wife to guilt him into calming down. Ann Filcher had been the only one
   to ever get between her man and a bottle. Shed have been the one with
   the sense to come in out of the rain, and to bring the dog with her.
   Think of your Annie, hed pleaded, reviving a woman only nine months
   dead of meningitis. Shed want a nice ceremony for Dodger tomorrow. To
   hear such drivel from Ravels mouth would have disgusted Doyle. But
   last night, amid the welter of a storm, it was the heartstrings or the
   handcuffs, and the prospect of a mud-soaked drunk vomiting Mad Dog
   20/20 in the backseat of the squad that had decided the matter.
   <p>The cold rain pelted straight through his uniform as Doyle stepped
   from the prowler onto Filchers property. The dead beagle lay swelling
   in a puddle beside the stoop. Apparently Filcher hadnt gotten around
   to that ceremony. Doyle climbed the porch and tapped at the door.
   Water ran freely through holes in the porch roof, one leak collecting
   in a dishpan and a dozen more boring into the floorboards with a sound
   of men urinating onto a deck. He knocked again and, getting no answer,
   looked across the bare yard. Filcher, a DUI recidivist who never again
   would take the wheel legally, had long ago sold off the fleet of
   fixer-uppers that once had made the lawn a junkyard or a used-car lot,
   depending on your price range. Nowadays, Doyle would sometimes see him
   rumbling down the sidewalks on a knobby-tired ATV, a Confederate flag
   rippling from the back as he barreled for the liquor store. Given that
   the man responded to routine questioning like one of his beloved rebs
   made to sing The Battle Hymn of the Republic, Doyle most days just
   paid him the slack and looked the other way.
   <p>Behind the filmy Plexiglas the living room looked abandoned, but
   something lay lengthwise beneath the door. Doyle squinted against the
   grime and made out Filchers muddy bare feet dangling from the end of a
   mattress on the floor. Cashed out. But was this sunrise or sunset,
   Filcher-time? Beddy-bye or wakey-wakey? Impossible to say.
   <p>Doyle came down off the porch and stood over the dog. Dodger had been
   a noisy but harmless nuisancea loudmouth but no biter. A pound puppy,
   hed dodged the gas, but had a few years of life been worth the
   humiliation of death by his masters stupidity? Filcher might have
   taken comfort in the animal, even loved it, but the truth was, hed
   killed it through an irresponsibility bred of grief, laziness, and
   alcoholism, a combination made lethal by his lack of will to change
   anything. Now the dog was police business, and given what kids might
   get up to with a swollen carcass, Doyle needed to do something with
   the body. Procedure for a dead stray was to radio the station and have
   the rendering plant send a man with a truck and a shovel. The truck
   would haul the corpse to National By-Products, which would toss it in
   a pot with diseased livestock and roadkill from all over the Midwest
   and render it into oils and bonemeal, a rancid stew whose fumes
   combined with those of the corn-syrup plant to produce that chokingly
   unique odor that said Ballson. Blending the scents of a slaughterhouse
   and a House of Pancakes, this stink had prevented Doyle from ever
   bringing a girl back to Ballson during his land grant years. And now
   that Carla had broken their engagement four months back, he might
   never bring another. Carlas first and only visit had been just a week
   before Doyle packed off for the academy. Im breathing dead animals!
   shed coughed at him, her eyes moist with fear. Hed laughed, thumping
   his chest. I grew up breathing them! Then hed driven them north,
   upwind and along the river, where wealthier Ballsonites never smelled
   the fumes off the boil vats. Eagle Bend was an oxbow, a limestone
   brake that hid from view the half-dozen smokestack plumes to the
   south. Here Doyle would build their waterfront home, complete with
   two-story deck and boat launch, the kind of solid, beloved abode
   passed down through generations. In the meantime, he assured her, the
   air outside his apartment complex often smelled perfectly fine,
   pleasant even, on days with a stiff southerly wind.
   <p>Still, Carla returned to school firm in her decision to stay on for
   graduate work. She would be away only as long as it took for a masters
   in social work. This she promised Doyle as he commenced his climb up
   the rungs from cadet to officer to sergeant to captain to chiefwho
   knows?perhaps even to public office. Patient in his love, Doyle even
   respected Carlas right to change her mind when, two years later, she
   announced that upon completing the MSW she would begin a two-year
   internship with Child Welfare in Des Moines, five hours away. Not a
   problem. He would miss her, of course, but Doyle swallowed this pill
   and simply worked all the harder, studying late into the evenings for
   a sergeants exam still two years in the offing.
   <p>Carlas third announcement, delivered a year into that internship, took
   him by surprise.
   <p>A doctorate? He put a hand over the phone to curse. Shed lead him to
   believe the MSW was a terminal degree. In?
   <p>Carlas voice was light with anticipation. Oh, I dont know. In New York
   or Massachusetts, I hope. Maybe California.
   <p>California? His head swam at the mileage. I beg your pardon? And you
   think thats being realistic?
   <p>Carla had often sounded distracted on the phone, ever since shed taken
   to starting important conversations with Doyle while getting the
   groceries or on her way to case evaluations. But she heard him this
   time, loud and clear. Realistic? And with a relish that suggested shed
   kept it cocked it for some time, holding her peace until hed exposed
   himself, she squeezed the trigger. Realistic? Im not the one getting
   contractors estimates for a house Im three promotions away from
   buying. Im not the one marooned on Fantasy Island playing policeman
   while
   <p>Hanging up on her for the first time, Doyle drove out to the range to
   shoot it off. Things had been strained, obviously, but he had little
   idea how unacceptable the strains had grown to Carla. It was a
   devastating surprise the next day to receive by express delivery the
   small parcel containing both his monogrammed pajamas and the ring hed
   placed on her finger when proposing.
