   <h>Imploding UL's - A Big Problem and Big Opportunity for Whole Life 
   <p>By: Ted Kowal, jtkowal@ftlife.com
   Farmers and Traders Life Insurance Company of New York 

   
   <p>The following Case study is an actual case with the names changed for
   privacy compliance.

   <p>Robert, a well respected agent with over thirty-five years in the
   business and twenty years with Farmers and Traders, had a very
   worrisome problem. In the late 1980's he placed a $500,000 Universal
   Life Policy with another quality company on one of his best client's,
   George. George was in his 40's at the time and owned a very successful
   business. Robert had also placed $1,000,000 in term on George. The UL
   policy performed well in the interest rate environment of the time. It
   was so successful that based upon illustrations, George stopped making
   premium payments and the cash values still grew.

   <p>Fifteen years later, George, who continued to prosper, went to one of
   the leading Estate Planning Attorneys in town. The lawyer invited
   Robert to participate in the planning and coordinate any insurance
   changes if needed. Robert asked for re-proposals on George's UL
   policy. Much to his chagrin the NAIC re-proposal showed that, despite
   the fact that there was still $180,000 in cash in the policy, the
   values were decreasing and the policy would run out of cash when
   George was in his 70's. The combination of George's age and the low UL
   interest rates of recent years had created this situation. Paying
   additional premiums was an option, but not very attractive to George.
   A 1035 exchange to a no lapse UL was a possibility, but that would
   basically tie up that cash from any other use. The attorney had
   recommended that George create an Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust
   (ILET) as part of a comprehensive estate plan. In addition to the
   $500,000 of permanent insurance on George's life, the plan called for
   a $1,500,000 second to die policy in the trust. The attorney tossed
   the problem of how to fund this plan to Robert. The client feels he
   has paid enough life insurance premiums. What does Robert do now?

   <p>Robert called Farmers and Traders to see if we could help. After some
   thought, the best answer appeared to be a 1035 Exchange of the UL to a
   Whole Life Policy. Whole life in general is a good answer for
   imploding UL policies, particularly on older clients, because the
   mortality charge is fixed and does not go up as the client gets older.
   Farmers and Traders, like some other whole life carriers, also has a
   "Paid-Up Additions" rider on our Whole Life policies that allows for
   deposits of cash into Whole Life policies, just like deposits into
   Universal life policies.

   <p>We prepared a proposal to replace the UL with a Whole Life policy. We
   did not use just any policy, but selected our Flagship Life II, which
   is a high premium, high cash value product. It is a Life Paid up at
   age 85 policy. The base policy applied for was only $250,000, but with
   the additional death benefit purchased with the $180,000 dump in, it
   brought the total death benefit of the policy over the $500,000 mark
   which allowed for a legal 1035 Exchange. Based upon current dividend
   projections, no additional premiums were necessary. In addition the
   cash value seemed to increase at an impressive rate, so seeing this
   fact we tried one additional step.

   <p>The premium on the Second-to-Die policy from another carrier was
   $7,200, so we illustrated that amount of premium coming out of the
   policy also. The withdrawals for that policy ran to age 100. We even
   showed the dividend at 75% of current projections and the policy sill
   supported itself and the Second-to-Die premium until George was in his
   late 80's.

   <p>The framework of the Estate Plan was now set. George applied for the
   Flagship II policy and once approved the existing UL policy was
   surrendered under IRC Sec. 1035 to the new policy. The new policy was
   then transferred to the newly created trust (ILIT). The only risk item
   was the gifting of the policy to the ILIT, but that was better then
   just cashing in the UL and paying tax. At Robert's request, George's
   attorney wrote a disclosure letter stating that if George died within
   three years the policy proceeds would be brought back into the estate
   for estate tax purposes. Since George was in good health that was
   deemed an acceptable risk. The Trustee of the ILET applied for the
   Second-to-Die policy. Once that was approved and issued the procedure
   was set up for the Trustee to withdraw the amount of the Second-to-Die
   premium every year.

   <p>Robert advised (in writing) George, his attorney, and the Trustee that
   the future dividend and interest rate performance of both policies in
   the trust should be reviewed every few years to see if the plan would
   perform. The ultimate resolution of the Estate Tax may also change
   things.

   <p>Robert felt relieved that a serious potential problem (and E&O claim)
   had not only been avoided, but that things had sorted out into an
   extremely successful estate plan. Additional commissions on the two
   new policies were just icing on the cake. Despite all the new things
   that come down the road in our industry, going back to one of the
   earliest building blocks in insurance, the Whole Life Policy, can
   still solve modern problems that newer products cannot.
