<h>Creating and growing a loyalty scheme - what to find out, and how - UPDATED
SEPTEMBER 2006

                          
               <p>By Peter Clark (co-author, The Loyalty Guide)
               Published by The Wise Marketer in April 2004.

       <p>Practical findings from 'The Loyalty Guide Volume II' report,
     summarising how loyalty programmes are set up, managed, measured,
       perceived and justified - whether B2B or B2C, in any industry
                                 sector...
                <h>From 'mom & pop' stores to mass marketing...
    <p>The relationship between the 21st century customer and supplier is a
    complex one. It was never straightforward, and events over the past
   fifty years or so have complicated it still further - although at the
   same time providing new ways of nurturing it. Over this time the face
    of marketing has changed beyond recognition. The 1950s and 1960s saw
     mass marketing at its peak. After the austerity of the war years,
    stores filled up with goods that consumers bought enthusiastically.
      But mass marketing had its disadvantages. It was almost totally
   untargeted, making it both costly and wasteful. It was indiscriminate,
    attracting as many 'cherry picking' customers as good customers. It
     depended on one-way communication: no feedback was received and no
                          relationship was formed.

                             <h>... and back again
     <p>Then they were all squeezed from another side. In some countries,
    retail space was growing at a faster rate than the population, which
   meant that it became more difficult and more expensive to attract new
   customers. In some of the major sectors discounters moved in, drawing
    yet more customers from the high street retailers. Suddenly, it made
    sense to retain regular customers rather than simply relying on new
    ones turning up. But how could organisations with thousands or even
   millions of customers apply the principles of mom and pop marketing to
   their massive empires? Well, once the case for the value of nurturing
           loyal customers was made, it began gathering momentum.

                       <h>The case for building loyalty
   <p>In 1990, The Harvard Business Review printed an article entitled 'Zero
     Defection: Quality Comes to Services', which eloquently argued the
   case for increasing profits by decreasing the rate at which customers
   defect. By retaining just 5% more of its customers, the article showed
      how a company could almost double its profits. Furthermore, in a
    period of only five years, a firm with a 70% customer retention rate
     will have lost 2 - 3 times as many customers as a firm with a 90%
                retention rate. It pays to engender loyalty.

                  <h> What can a loyalty programme achieve?
   <p>Loyalty programmes are known for some of their more obvious effects -
   such as increasing spend (and therefore customer lifetime value), and
   better retention - but they can also achieve a number of other things
    that impact the company's business strategy, operational efficiency,
    human resources policy, and more. For example: customer acquisition,
   up-selling and cross-selling, intelligent deselection (getting rid of
   unprofitable customers), winning back defected customers, selection of
    new outlet locations, reducing advertising costs, stock planning and
   merchandising, getting competitive responses right first time, setting
    pricing policies, building lasting relationships, and enabling true
                         'best customer marketing'.

                        <h>So what is customer loyalty?
        <p>Loyalty is an abstract concept - there is no single complete
    definition of it. It comes in different types and different degrees.
   Customers are loyal or otherwise for many different reasons: some are
    loyal from choice, some are loyal because both parties have invested
      time and effort in building a relationship, while some are loyal
      because their needs are met or exceeded, and others because the
                 relationship is profitable to both sides.

     <p>A number of factors play a part in influencing the loyalty and the
    commitment of customers, such as the quality and value of your core
    offering, levels of customer satisfaction, 'elasticity' inherent in
    the sector or product category, other competitors in the market, and
           even social, demographic and geographical influences.

                      <h>The secrets of customer loyalty
      <p>In The Loyalty Guide Volume II, we examine in full detail the 17
     critical factors that govern the success or failure of any loyalty
    programme or relationship-based marketing initiative, explaining the
        traps and pitfalls alongside the paths to profit, including:
    <l>1. Not using a loyalty programme as a 'quick fix'
    <l>2. Accurate targeting
    <l>3. Gaining true consumer buy-in
    <l>4. Knowing your customers better
    <l>5. Rewarding only the right behaviours
    <l>6. Rewarding vs. recognising customers?
    <l>7. Spotting defection patterns
    <l>8. Using customer lifecycles
    <l>9. Rewards appearing to be attainable and affordable
   <l>10. Making programme costs recoverable
   <l>11. Good communications
   <l>12. Keeping it simple
   <l>13. Measurable results
   <l>14. Customer acquisition targets
   <l>15. Having unique benefits that competitors can't copy
   <l>16. Empowering your team - and front-line staff
   <l>17. Making life easy for the customer

               <h> What about partnering with other companies?
     <p>There are un-partnered loyalty programmes, and there are partnered
   programmes ('coalitions'). Within the partnered category of programme,
   there are two main types of multi-partner programmes that have proved
   their value time and time again: true coalition programmes, and single
              operator programmes that include other partners.

     <p>Tesco's Clubcard is an example of a single operator programme that
     involves other partners. The programme is owned and run by Tesco.
   However, Clubcard holders can collect points when buying from various
    partners in the programme, such as Alders, Beefeater, Marriott, and
    National Tyres. Vidal Sassoon is an example of a redemption partner.

       <p>However, for example, Air Miles and Nectar are true coalition
     programmes. The programme management is independent of any of the
      partners. The partners have contracts with the operators of the
    programme to issue and/or redeem the currency of the programme, and
      only have access to data harvested by the programme through its
                                 operator.

     <p>The Loyalty Guide Volume II also examines the many essential goals
    that any coalition programme must achieve if it's going to succeed,
       and why they're so important. Examples of these goals include:

     <l>* Rapid market penetration
     <l>* Delivery of attractive rewards
     <l>* Being the first in the market
     <l>* Building communication channels

                     <h>Strengths and weaknesses compared
      <p>Supported by statistics, illustrations and expert opinions, the
   advantages, disadvantages and structural needs of coalition programmes
    (compared to, say, an non-partnered loyalty programme) are detailed,
                     covering critical factors such as:

     <l>* Interest in the programme
     <l>* Fewer cards to carry
     <l>* Members earn points quickly
     <l>* Greater variety of rewards
     <l>* Concentrated, coherent promotions
     <l>* Time saved in development
     <l>* Lower costs of development
     <l>* Database run by professionals
     <l>* Sector exclusivity
     <l>* Coalition marketing campaigns
     <l>* High penetration
      <l>* Real cost benefits

                       <h>How companies have succeeded?
    <p>In the report, we have written up case studies, programme summaries
     and development notes for just about all the world's major loyalty
   coalitions, co-branded, payment card-based and single-merchant loyalty
    programmes in depth, covering operational details across a range of
                      industry sectors and countries.

    <p>A great deal can be learned from looking at how existing programmes
       have succeeded - or failed - and understanding not only their
   approaches to loyalty but also their structure and market dynamics. In
   The Loyalty Guide Volume II it's our case studies that demonstrate the
     key principles for customer loyalty success at work - for example:

                    <h> Credit card and debit card loyalty
   <p>Co-branded and affinity programmes are usually based on a credit card,
     and burgeoned in the 1990s. But, while they are still popular with
      consumers and card issuers alike, the market in some regions has
                          become somewhat mature.

   <p>A co-branded card is a the result of a partnership between an issuing
        bank and a co-branding partner which could be any commercial
    organisation (such as an airline, automobile association, retailer,
   insurance company or motor manufacturer). One example of a co-branded
           card is the UK's GM Platinum Card, issued by HFC Bank.

       <p> An affinity card is similar except that the partner is not a
       commercial organisation, but is generally a non-profit making
    organisation like a club, association, charity or professional body.
      One example is the Amnesty International Visa Card issued by the
       Cooperative Bank. Affinity cards allow the issuer to mine the
         potential of the database of members of an already formed
                           non-commercial group.

     <p> The affinity group itself benefits from extra funds, as a fee is
       usually paid for each member who enrols for a card, and then a
       percentage of each transaction's value is also garnered. Most
        importantly, affinity cardholders feel good because they are
    positively helping a cause close to their hearts, so they are likely
       to use the card in preference to other cards they might have.

   <p>However, chip-based credit cards (smart cards) - commonly based on the
     global EMV (Europay/Mastercard/Visa) standard, have opened up the
    field for loyalty programmes. The chip used to handle the financial
   side of the card has enough to space to run other programmes and store
   third-party data on it as well. In effect, card issuers can run their
    own loyalty programmes on credit cards while retail merchants do the
                         same - with the same card.

       <p> Standards for these cards, including the use of contactless
     (RFID-based) payment cards, have developed quickly in the past two
      years, and are examined thoroughly in our report, along with the
    implications not only for marketers and co-branding efforts but also
    for consumers and their attitudes and loyalty to banks and financial
                               institutions.

                          <h>Best customer marketing
   <p>Best customer marketing (BCM) is all about directing the major part of
    your marketing budget and effort toward your best customers - those
   who bring you the most profit. To many, the principle sounds obvious -
    perhaps too obvious to even discuss. So why, in reality, are so very
   few companies actually practising best customer marketing effectively?

    <p>Best customer marketing is not a new concept - it has been practised
      since marketing began. It was the cornerstone of the 'mom & pop'
      stores that were so prevalent until the 1950s. It's plain common
   sense: look after your best customers really well because they are the
   ones who generate the most profits. But, in order to identify the best
     customers, you need customer data. That was easy in the mom & pop
    stores: the staff knew all the customers personally, knew what they
   bought regularly, could anticipate their needs, and could reward those
   who generated the most profit. But in order to identify best customers
       today, you need customer data, and you need to market to them
                                accordingly.

    <p>In four well-documented, carefully graphed and charted case studies,
     the report shows you exactly how customers have been successfully
    moved up from low-spending segments of companies' customer bases to
     top-spending segments without even using a loyalty card - it's all
   down to the incentives, the timing, the compelling offer you make, and
    the gradual adjustment of customers' habits and shopping behaviours.

                  <h>Loyalty, lifetime value & profitability
   <p>We know that, in theory, building customer loyalty increases profits.
     But how can we measure how effective it is in reality? How can we
   predict the effect an investment in loyalty will have on the future of
   the business? While no method can ever be perfect, measuring loyalty's
   effect on Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is one of the best - and most
     accurate - ways, particularly if the management wants to maximise
   customer profitability during the whole of each customer's life cycle
                             with the company.

    <p>The increased interest that managers have shown over the past decade
   or so in CRM, customer databases, data warehouses, and data mining is
       a positive development. Having such a system in place provides
       essential data that can be analysed to provide better business
                 intelligence and decision-making support.

    <p> There are many business models that can be used to get an overall
    picture of the kind of relationships and correlations that form the
   basis of CLV calculations - many of which are examined in detail, with
                   supporting research and case studies.

                     <h>How to building your own CLV model
     <p>Chapter 6 of The Loyalty Guide examines those models and formulae,
   with easy-to-follow examples that demonstrate the financial advantage
     and power that predictive CLV calculation offers your business. It
     also looks into some of the alternatives to direct investments in
   customer loyalty that businesses have employed in the past, including:

     <l>* Production rationalisation
     <l>* Mass marketing
     <l>* Market share
     <l>* Quality management
     <l>* Service management
     <l>* Relationship management
     <l>* CRM

                    <h>The human aspect of Customer Loyalty
       <p>Clearly the human aspect of loyalty programmes is of paramount
   importance. Loyalty and even satisfaction are human emotions. Actions
    that might make one person loyal could well repel someone else. Even
   worse, something that might engender feelings of loyalty in someone on
         one day might be the last thing they want on another day.

    <p>So can a loyalty card really create loyalty? Well, loyalty cards are
    just one element of the overall shopping experience, rather than the
    prime reason for choosing a particular store, while factors such as
   price, quality, service, and convenience contribute more to fostering
      loyal shoppers, according to consumer research food and grocery
      think-tank, IGD. For the majority of loyalty card users in IGD's
    survey, the card itself was not the key driver in store choice, and
    shoppers considered it as a 'nice to have' extra. However, those who
   said they use them regularly also said they see a clear value in doing
    so. In fact, if the loyalty programme leads to better service and a
    strengthened relationship, then yes, loyalty is often engendered and
      nurtured, and the results are higher spending and more frequent
                                  visits.

                    <h>The psychology of loyalty explained
    <p>The Loyalty Guide gathers together a range of research into consumer
    psychology and attitudes, and the knowledge that experience brings,
     from a wide array of sources (both commercial and academic). While
   there is a surprising correlation between most of the findings, there
    are also differences of opinion that are unlikely to ever be settled
    completely. Research included in the report illuminates a variety of
   both loyal and disloyal behaviour - for example, the top three reasons
                       for joining a loyalty scheme:

     <l>* Benefit of being rewarded for products and services frequently
       used (54% of consumers)
     <l>* Greater discounts on products and services (49% of consumers)
     <l>* Special member-only perks (42% of consumers)

                              <h>    Rewards
   <p>Reward drives behaviour. We teach our pets how to behave by rewarding
    them when they behave correctly, and by not rewarding them when they
       don't. Reward the behaviour that you want and don't reward the
   behaviour that you would like to discourage, and behaviour will follow
       reward - within reason. But, paradoxically, while a big reward
   reinforces desired behaviour better than a small reward, when rewards
   are discontinued, those who have received big rewards are more likely
     to return to the old buying pattern than those who received small
   rewards. So the warning is clear: never, ever let your best customers
            feel that you are withdrawing privileges from them.

   <p>It follows from this that the reward is a crucial part of any loyalty
    programme. It has to be desirable enough to change the behaviour of
    customers. In fact, if the reward is really well chosen, it will be
     attractive to the target group of customers, and not attractive to
   customers who are not really valuable to the business. It also has to
             be affordable, and balancing the two sides of the
   desirability/affordability equation is tricky. Our report examines the
      key functions of a loyalty reward, offering sound advice on what
    consumers might value, and what might disappoint them. It also walks
     you through the properties or attributes that are always found in
                        successful loyalty rewards.

                           <h>The identifying token
   <p>There are many ways of tracking customers' purchases in order to later
   provide them with a reward. Whether the reward is a simple discount, a
    more targeted discount, points which lead to a gift from a catalogue
   or later money-off offer, or even extra services, there has to be some
      means of recognising each customer at the point of sale. This is
   usually an identifying token that the customer presents when making a
                                 purchase.

    <p>Technology-wise, the token itself can range in sophistication from a
     printed membership card through to bar-coded tags, magnetic stripe
    cards, PET cards, thermochromic cards, chip cards, smart cards, RFID
       cards or tags, or even biometric devices such as finger print
                                recognition.

                  <h>What data should be collected, and why?
     <p>Many of the benefits of creating and operating a customer loyalty
    programme, or implementing a customer relationship management (CRM)
   system, come from the collection, analysis, and use of data. The more
      data we can practically use, the better: customer demographics,
    preferences, lifestyle and life stage, transaction history, returns,
                  and even customer service event history.

        <p>The loyalty programme gives us a way of identifying specific
    customers, and tying their demographic records to their transaction
       records in the back-end database (whether that be an in-house
   collection of databases, an enterprise-wide CRM system, or some other
     data warehouse that's being updated, analysed, and used across the
                              whole business).
     <p>Business intelligence starts with data. The uses of the resultant
   data, given all the technologies that are now available to analyse it
        and turn it into useful support for business decisions, are
                            potentially endless.

     <p>Apart from delving deep into the technical side of databases, data
   warehouses, data relationships, and structures, The Loyalty Guide also
        details the how, when, where, and why of data collection and
   aggregation. It describes the many uses that customer data can be put
                       to, including (to name a few):

     <l>* Customer behaviour profiling
     <l>* Customer lifestyle & demographic profiling
     <l>* Customer product preferences and repertoire
     <l>* Customer targeting and differentiation
     <l>* Best customer marketing and win-back
     <l>* Product category relationships & cross-selling
     <l>* Planning and merchandising
     <l>* Online shopping suggestions
     <l>* Pricing policies

                        <h>Communication with consumers
   <p>There are many more communication channels available today than there
    were before the rise of interactive and electronic media such as the
    internet and mobile telecommunications. Communication with consumers
     and other businesses can take place by mail, telephone, fax, text
     message (SMS), multimedia message (MMS), e-mail, instant messaging
       (IM), voice over IP (VoIP), internet chat rooms, web sites and
     bulletin boards, and other internet-based systems including video
       conferencing and meeting sharing systems such as the Microsoft
      Netmeeting service. Each has different cost implications to the
        business, and different perceived benefits to the consumer.

                    <h>Avoid being caught in a spam trap...
        <p>But with each channel of communication comes a unique set of
      challenges: people don't like junk mail, or 'spam' (unsolicited
       commercial e-mail), or unsolicited sales telephone calls. They
    complain about faxes wasting paper, and they don't want their mobile
   phone invaded by irrelevant advertising text messages. They don't want
   to run up bandwidth bills for receiving unwanted MMS communications on
    their internet mobile phone, and they don't want their PC's instant
   messenger program popping up unwelcome advances from companies they've
                  never dealt with. And the list goes on.

   <p> But it's not all bad news, either! There are ways, means, laws, and
    ethical practices that cut through the communication barrier for all
   of these channels, allowing you to communicate and build relationships
    with existing customers and sales prospects alike. The report walks
   you through the many practical ways of making sure your e-mails don't
        get stopped, making your messages easier to read, and being
     consumer-friendly enough to have people want to read them. And the
   same goes for SMS, direct mail, advertising, inserts, radio, the web,
      call centres and even front-line employees talking to customers
                                 in-store.

                          <h>Sector specific insights
   <p>Different sectors are viewing and approaching loyalty differently, and
   are different stages of development, both in business terms and in the
      minds of consumers. Moreover, there are regional, national, and
   international variations and forces at work which mean that a road-map
     to loyalty in your geographical areas of operation is all the more
                          important. For example:

     <h>* Loyalty on the internet
       <p>Building loyalty online is always going to be a challenge because
       of the ease with which consumers can find new suppliers and change
       their allegiances. There are challenges for those companies that
       choose the online loyalty path instead of a systematic programme
       of low pricing and discounts. Loyalty requires a relationship, and
       the ability for the programme's operator to collect high quality,
       accurate data about consumers and their preferences and spending
       habits. But many consumers, while they are willing to give
       accurate personal details in-store, or on a printed application
       form, are unwilling to give out personal details in the online
       environment. Part of this unwillingness is certainly attributable
       to the idea that the internet is not secure, and that it is too
       easy for personal information to be gathered, analysed, copied,
       sold, distributed, or abused.
       <p>Another big problem still facing the internet at large is that it
       has traditionally been seen as a 'free for all' resource, and many
       internet users still believe that - with the exception of the most
         obvious online retailer - everything on the internet should be
        free of charge, without any ties or obligations, and without the
         need to identify yourself. Most don't realise that they are in
         fact leaving a massive electronic trail behind them when they
       browse the web, and mistakenly believe that anonymity is not only
          possible but that it should be the norm for internet usage.
            <p>So, assuming the consumer is willing to trade their data
       (personal, behavioural, and transactional, for example) for points
       with an online store, the concept of online loyalty faces a major
       problem in itself. The market for any given product or service is
         very large because the internet is (generally speaking) fast,
         global, and convenient to use. Entire web sites have sprung up
       with the specific aim of getting the customer to shop around (such
        as shopping.com, kelkoo.co.uk, and Google's froogle.com), all of
            which make their comparisons based largely on price and
          availability rather than on service, loyalty programmes, or
           relationship benefits. While such sites are undoubtedly an
        excellent resource for consumers, online retailers will find it
          increasingly difficult to differentiate based on service or
                               loyalty benefits.
        <p>The internet isn't all bad news for the loyalty marketer either.
       Never in the history of marketing has communication with customers
       (both existing and potential) been so cheap, so flexible, so fast,
       or so easily monitored. An e-mail is currently one of the cheapest
       communication channels available to marketers, and one of the most
        flexible too: there are no print runs, and each and every e-mail
            (given the right database and IT infrastructure) can be
        personalised not only in terms of the customer's name but right
       down to the message's content, images and offers. E-mail is unlike
          traditional direct mail in that the marketer can tell almost
        immediately when a message could not be delivered, meaning that
        consumers with 'dead addresses' can be immediately swapped onto
          reclaim campaigns to try to re-acquire their current e-mail
                      address and updated contact details.

     <h>* Brand loyalty
       <p>There would be no point in spending marketing dollars building
       brand awareness if customers don't buy the brand again after
       they've tried it the first time. Today's brand marketers all have
       the same aim: to encourage brand loyalty - the situation where
       consumers choose a brand over its competitors and private label
       equivalents because they want to.
      <p> A good definition of brand loyalty is that given by Jan Hofmeyr
       and Butch Rice, in their book 'Commitment-Led Marketing': "Brand
       loyalty is the tendency of someone to buy a brand again and again
       because they prefer it over others."
         <p>Research shows that the brand loyalty of customers has fallen
         steadily over the past two or three decades. Results vary, but
        it's probably fair to say that today's average consumer is only
        75% to 85% as loyal as the consumer of the 1970s or 80s. So why
        did this happen? There are several reasons, just a few of which
                                      are:

   <l> 1. There is much more choice today: the number of products and brands
       within most categories has increased greatly.
   <l> 2. The number of advertisements seen by consumers daily has increased
       enormously, especially since new channels like the internet, email
       and SMS have arrived on the scene.
   <l> 3. Modern consumers are more sophisticated and more likely to think
       for themselves and to try different products.
    <l>4. There is more comparative information available, on web sites and
       in consumer magazines and the national press.
    <l>5. The standard of service (and of products) has in many cases
       improved to the stage where there is not much difference between
       brands.
    <l>6. Price competition has increased.

      <p>In a full chapter on Brand Loyalty we focus on the successes and
     techniques seen most recently, and also the problems facing brand
      marketers and how they can be overcome. We look closely at which
      groups of consumers are worth marketing to, and how much they're
    worth, along with some sector-specific branding ideas and research,
     market variations in brand loyalty, and tools that can be used for
   brand marketing. We've also taken the opportunity to focus on research
   and trends that reveal answers to common branding problems. With brand
    loyalty foremost in mind, it answers common branding questions such
                                    as:

     <l>* Which are the big brands, and why?
     <l>* What are the problems facing brand marketers?
     <l>* How can branding problems be overcome?
     <l>* Which groups of consumers are worth marketing to?
     <l>* What does sector-specific branding research reveal?
     <l>* What national variations are there in brand loyalty?
     <l>* What tools for brand marketing are available?


     <h>Business to Business loyalty programmes
   <p>Business to business loyalty programmes and incentive schemes seem, on
   first consideration, to be a great idea: a way of encouraging one
   business to continue doing business with another. But they also come
   with their own pitfalls that don't occur in consumer-based loyalty
   programmes. For example:

     <l>* Is it ethical to reward a client's employees to make decisions
       based on personal gain?
     <l>* Who should be rewarded: the business owner, management, employees,
       the business itself, or all?
     <l>* Is the person who gets the benefits always the one who makes the
       actual purchase decisions?

   <p>The list of problems grows or shrinks depending on the industry sector
   involved, and on how well the relationship between supplier and client
   is defined and controlled. For example, there is little point in a CPG
   manufacturer rewarding the product buying clerks at a supermarket's
   head office when the decisions on product range, quantity, and shelf
   space allocation are taken by others (such as marketing and
   merchandising managers). This represents a tightly controlled buying
   environment in which direct rewards for employees are fruitless.

   <p>However, in a more flexible (and typically smaller) business
   environment, buyers often have authority over stock control, product
   range, quantities, and even merchandising arrangements. In these
   cases, a B2B loyalty programme that rewards the buyer would probably
   work - even if it stands on unsteady ethical ground.

   <p>There is another situation where B2B loyalty schemes work very well:
   channel sales partner programmes. These are where a manufacturer
   directly rewards the sales staff of companies that resell its
   products. This kind of selling incentive is very constructive because
   it benefits both businesses equally, in terms of greater sales and
   profit. By generating strong engagement between channel partners'
   sales people and the products themselves, the resultant increase in
   product knowledge and familiarity means that a more authoritative line
   can be taken in the sales process when dealing with end users. A fine
   example of this kind of programme's success is the Indian networking
   specialist Nortel, which achieved 40% growth in channel sales after
   one year of running such a programme, for which we have provided a
   detailed case study in our B2B chapter.

     <h>Supermarket loyalty initiatives
   <p>Supermarkets face intense competition, not only from other
   supermarkets but also from warehouse clubs, supercentres (like
   Wal-Mart) and convenience stores. When Sir John Cohen, founder of the
   UK-based Tesco empire, brought the idea back to the UK from the US
   soon after World War II, the model for supermarkets was to "pile it
   high and sell it cheap". Many of the original supermarkets were like
   glorified market stalls. Then came the concept of self service, and
   the distant ancestor of the modern supermarket was born.

   <p>Today, leading supermarkets are among the most sophisticated retailers
   in the world. They lead most other sectors in customer data collection
   and analysis, in stock management, in level of customer service and in
   retail innovation. Metro Group in Germany has already started the
   technological charge with its Future Store (www.future-store.org)
   initiative, which automates just about everything a customer can see,
   do, or touch in the 'supermarket of the future'. As we predicted in
   The Loyalty Guide Volume I (the 2004 edition), supermarkets are
   leading the way.

   <p>Which retailers led with customer segmentation based on purchases,
   with closely targeted offers to specific customers, with dedicated
   customer service desks, with designated parking spaces for mothers
   with small children, with umbrella service to the car on rainy days?
   In many cases, the supermarkets.

   <p>In the report's chapter on Supermarkets we look at the dynamics of
   loyalty programmes in the supermarket sector, then in close detail at
   some of the leading programmes.

   <p>With respect to customer retention strategies, supermarkets can be
   broadly divided into three groups:
    <l>1. Those that rely on every-day low prices (EDLP) to keep their
       customers;
    <l>2. Those that rely on loyalty programmes for best customer marketing;
    <l>3. Those that rely on excellent service and ranges of products.

   <p>Of course, there are many shades in this spectrum and some supermarket
   chains adopt all three methods to varying degrees.

     <h>Loyalty to other retailers
   <p>In general retail, today's key need is to focus on what drives loyalty
   programmes, what customers actually prefer, and what the future is
   likely to bring. Most retailers accept that they need to know more
   about their customers, and that the knowledge should be centrally
   recorded so that it is available to employees when they need it.

   <p>In this chapter we examine what makes consumers shop the way they do,
   what makes them choose one retailer over another, and illuminate the
   dynamics of loyalty programmes in general retail sector, looking in
   detail at some of the leading programmes, operators, and developments
   in the field. We also examine the effectiveness of loyalty programmes,
   and follow current and future shopping trends. Also highlighted are
   the many problems of customer retention strategy planning in the
   supermarket and general retail sectors.

   <p>We have provided a great deal of coverage of retail loyalty programmes
   around the world in the main report itself, and have also created a
   reference directory of major loyalty programmes in all countries,
   broken down by sector (Appendix C).

     <h>Airlines and frequent flyer programmes
   <p>The airline industry has been amazingly active over the past two
   years, with barely a day passing without a new programme, a new
   service initiative, a new redemption feature, or a new promotion
   springing up somewhere in the world.

   <p>A lot of this activity has focused on adding value (such as extra
   travel benefits and personal luxuries) for the upper tiers of airline
   frequent flyer programmes. This is a good focus to keep, of course,
   because these frequent flyers are the most profitable customers.

   <p>The higher classes of travel (business class, premium class, first
   class, and half a dozen other names describing non-economy classes)
   are so much becoming the focus of airlines' attention that there are
   now complete airlines devoted to first class or business class travel,
   without a single economy seat on their aircraft. This report's authors
   predict that this trend will increase, driving a widening wedge
   between airlines that carry economy passengers (for whom personal
   service can be expected to decline in line with decreasing prices) and
   those that carry business and luxury passengers (for whom personal
   service will increase thanks to the lower financial and staffing
   overheads caused by the loss of economy class).

   <p>In the Airline chapter of the report we provide full details and
   reference for over 30 leading airlines and their frequent flyer
   programmes, including:

    <l>· Air Berlin (Top Bonus)
    <l>· Air Canada (Aeroplan)
    <l>· Air France & KLM (Flying Blue)
    <l>· Air New Zealand (Airpoints)
    <l>· Alaska Airlines (Mileage Plan)
    <l>· America West (FlightFund)
    <l>· American Airlines (AAdvantage)
    <l>· Bangkok Airways (FlyerBonus)
    <l><l>· British Airways (Executive Club)
    <l>· China Southern (Sky Pearl Club)
    <l>· Continental (One Pass)
    <l>· Delta Airlines (SkyMiles)
    <l>· Emirates (Skywards)
    <l>· Frontier Airlines (EarlyReturns)
    <l>· Hawaiian Air (HawaiianMiles)      · Jet Airways (JPMiles)
    <l>· JetBlue (TrueBlue)
    <l>· Kingfisher Airlines (Power Flyer)
    <l>· Lufthansa (Miles & More)
    <l>· Malaysia Airlines (Enrich & Grads)
    <l>· Midwest Airlines (Midwest Miles)
    <l>· Northwest Airlines (WorldPerks)
    <l>· Qatar Airways (Privilege Club)
    <l>· SN Brussels Airlines (Privilege)
    <l>· South African Airways (Voyager)

    <l>· US Airways (Dividend Miles)
    <l>· Virgin Atlantic (Flying Club)
    <l>· Virgin Blue (Velocity Rewards)
    <l>· Virgin Express (Flight Club)

     <h>Loyalty to hotels, resorts and casinos
   <p>In mid-2004 almost half (49%) of surveyed visitors to hotel branded
   web sites claimed they did not belong to any hotel loyalty programme,
   according to iPerceptions and Hospitality eBusiness Strategies. This
   revealed an untapped market and an opportunity to increase customer
   loyalty. Another key finding was that hotel brands need to enhance
   almost every aspect of their web sites to meet the increasing
   requirements of major customer segments, as less than 19% of all
   visitors to branded hotel web sites characterised their experience as
   "excellent".

   <p>According to the Rewards Network, in today's competitive hospitality
   market, many hotel operators are adding frequent guest loyalty
   programmes to foster customer relationships, attract new customers,
   and encourage longer stays, which suggests that rewards programmes are
   seen as being more effective in creating loyalty to hotel brands than
   simple discount-based promotions and incentives.

   <p>Interestingly, research by Phoenix Marketing International has found
   that only a small proportion of big-name hotel frequent guest
   programme members could correctly identify all the participating hotel
   brands at which they stand to benefit from their membership. Members
   of the Hilton HHonors, Radisson Gold Rewards, and Starwood Preferred
   Guest programmes had the lowest rate of recall for hotel brands
   participating in the loyalty programme. However, we note that hotel
   groups that have a greater number of brands and partners are more
   likely to rank lower than those with few partners, because it is
   harder for consumers to recall long lists of names.

   <p>In the Hotels, Resorts and Casinos chapter of the report we provide
   full details and reference for 15 of the leading hotels and their
   frequent guest loyalty programmes, including:

    <l>· America's Best Value Inn (Value Club)
    <l>· Best Western (Gold Crown Club)
    <l>· Carlson Hotels Worldwide (GoldPoints)
    <l>· Cendant Hotels & Resorts (TripRewards)
    <l>· Choice Hotels (Choice Privileges)
    <l>· Coast Hotels & Resorts (Coast Rewards)
    <l>· Delta Hotels (Delta Privilege)
    <l>· InterContinental (Priority Club Rewards)
           <l>· Hilton (Hilton HHonors)
    <l>· Holiday Inn (eHost initiative)
    <l>· Jameson Inns (Stock Awards)
    <l>· Marriott (Marriott Rewards)
    <l>· Starwood Hotels (Preferred Guest)
    <l>· Travelodge Canada (Guest Rewards)
    <l>· Wyndham (Wyndham ByRequest)



     <h>Travel and tourism loyalty
  <p> Our chapter on loyalty in general travel and tourism markets looks
   into recent developments and innovations in the general travel and
   tourism sector that are not directly associated with airlines,
   frequent flyer programmes, hotels, holiday resorts, frequent guest
   programmes, casinos and frequent player loyalty schemes.

   <p>It includes loyalty and customer satisfaction-related developments
   throughout the sector, worldwide, and the findings of surveys and
   research concerning cruises, travel sellers, travel incentives and
   loyalty schemes, rail operators, regional and national tourism
   initiatives, and car rentals.

   <p>Case studies, programme summaries and a reference guide provide
   details of global car rental loyalty programmes in particular,
   including:

     <l>* Avis Preferred Service (for individuals)
     <l>* Avis Corporate Awards (for businesses)
     <l>* Budget's RapidRez programme
     <l>* Dollar Express
     <l>* Enterprise's Corporate Class Rental programme
     <l>* Europcar Privilege Card (in Germany)
     <l>* Hertz #1 Club
     <l>* National's Emerald Club (for individuals)
     <l>* National's Business Benefit Program (for businesses)
     <l>* Thrifty's Blue Chip Rewards programme


     <h<Loyalty to dining, drinking, and recreation
   <p>Developing technologies are beginning to play a greater role in
   restaurants and diner satisfaction initiatives. There are now
   table-mounted wireless consoles that diners can use summon waiters,
   and loyalty programmes that provide the ultimate in personalised
   service, where the waiter greets you by name, seats you at your
   favourite table, serves you your usual drink, and can even suggest
   menu items in accordance with your personal tastes. Biometrics and
   RFID technologies are even being employed to speed things up
   throughout the meal. In this chapter, we explain the latest research,
   technologies, applications, loyalty programmes, and market
   developments.

   <p>In the world of fast food, consumer behaviour patterns and preferences
   are beginning to re-shape the dietary and service landscapes, end even
   the major chains (such as Burger King, McDonald's and Subway) are
   adjusting the way they do things to please ever-more health conscious
   consumers. Coffee houses are stepping up their efforts to engender not
   only loyalty but also inertia through the introduction of prepaid gift
   cards and frequent-beverage loyalty programmes. Even beers and spirits
   are beginning to develop loyalty programmes of their own. In this
   chapter we examine not only the consumer's view these establishments
   but also the strides that have been taken toward satisfaction and
   genuine loyalty.

   <p>In the world of sports, customer loyalty programmes and benefits are
   being combined into payment programmes, ticketing systems, season
   ticket allocations, merchandise sales, in-stadium concessions, and
   even local out-of-stadium retailers. No longer is sports marketing
   restricted to sponsorships and track-side billboards. In the USA,
   we've seen innovative team-based programmes supported by the MLB and
   NFL, as well as NASCAR, various golf clubs and other sporting
   associations - all of which are detailed in this chapter.

   <p>Key topics covered in the chapter include dining out, fast food
   loyalty programmes and promotional strategies, coffee houses,
   alcoholic beverages, entertainments, and sports, all with world-wide
   coverage.

    <h> Loyalty in the automotive & fuel sector
   <p>Cars are now almost a commodity, and car manufacturers have a problem.
   It might almost be fair to say that the most noticeable point of
   differentiation between competing, similar marques is the dealer who
   sells the car. Certainly, that seems to be the area where most can go
   wrong, and most complaints arise. So much depends on the way the car
   is sold and particularly the way that the after sales contacts and
   service are carried out. It's quite possible that it's for this reason
   that research shows less loyalty to dealers than to manufacturers. To
   build loyalty to the marque, the manufacturer has to produce an
   attractive, desirable, reliable vehicle at the right price. Most of
   them would seem to be very good at doing that.

   <p>It is essential that car dealers - the potential weak link in the
   chain - are single pointed and focus on finding out what their
   customers want, why they want it, and work out ways of meeting these
   needs as closely as possible. For this reason, much of the research
   quoted in the automotive chapter of the report is about what customers
   want, what they don't want, and the reasons why they buy or reject
   certain makes.

   <p>Generating customer loyalty is always more difficult in a sector where
   contacts are infrequent. And, while new cars with very lengthy service
   intervals may be very convenient for the customer, they make it even
   less likely that the dealer and customer will have many opportunities
   to build a relationship. Every contact - rare as they are becoming -
   must be treated with great care and delicacy if any loyalty is to be
   built.

   <p>And fuel retailers are also facing a full-scale battle
   The forecourt sector (fuel retailers - that is, 'petrol' to the Briton
   or 'gasoline' to the American) was one of the first sectors to become
   involved in loyalty programmes; in fact, in the early 1990s some
   people equated loyalty programmes with forecourt programmes. Many of
   the initial programmes were quite rudimentary and collected no useful
   customer data. Some gave a gift when a certain amount was spent on
   fuel - for example, a free drinking glass for each £5 spent. Not even
   the customer's name was collected. Others issued stamps or coupons for
   each purchase. When these were redeemed, the customer was sometimes
   identified. There are many hundreds of forecourt loyalty programmes
   around the world so, in this chapter, we have focused mainly on those
   in the UK, along with a selection of those in other parts of the
   world.

   <p>Traditional oil company fuel retailers in the UK have not had an easy
   decade. As well as losing market share to the supermarkets who have
   invaded the territory, profit margins have fallen. Petrol is a
   commodity - it is very difficult to build a customer base that is
   loyal to any particular brand simply because of the quality of the
   fuel. Retailers compete either on convenience - lots of sites at
   convenient places, service (added value like convenience stores
   on-site) or simply on price. All of these factors combine to make
   customer retention essential. So how has the sector faired? Well, it
   would seem that the consumer's familiarity with forecourt programmes
   has led them to expect these programmes as par for the course. We
   explain what fuel retailers have been doing in different countries,
   and how they are interacting with other retailers and market sectors
   to generate their own competitive advantage - sometimes getting
   downright sneaky!

     <h>Loyalty to FSIs, banks and payment cards
   <p>The financial services sector is at different stages of customer
   relationship development across the countries of the world, with much
   of the most recent progress being made in the United States, Canada,
   Europe and Asia-Pacific.

   <p>Apart from the problems of providing, growing, and maintaining a
   financial services infrastructure that consumers are willing and happy
   to use, and while customer relationship management aims to build
   customer loyalty through the use of data capture, analysis,
   segmentation and improved service, the intense competition from
   newcomers (such as supermarkets' financial brands) provides its own
   problems.

   <p>Credit cards and debit cards present their own challenges, with most
   of them now being tied to loyalty rewards, consumer benefits, or cash
   rebates. So much so, in fact, that market research firm Packaged Facts
   predicted in July 2005 that 85% of consumer credit cards in
   circulation will be offering some sort of reward for their usage by
   2009, suggesting that the appeal and value proposition of credit card
   loyalty rewards may be significantly devalued by then. So what has the
   industry been doing about this problem, and what can it do in the
   future? Our report explores all of these issues, and how the financial
   services industry as a whole can proceed while growing customer
   lifetime value and nurturing genuine customer loyalty.

   <p>We've identified and charted the key financial services loyalty and
   market trends, including coverage of banks, building societies, money
   lenders, insurers, internet banking, benchmarking efforts, secrets of
   successful FSI loyalty and CRM initiatives, and of course case studies
   and summaries of major credit card loyalty initiatives worldwide,
   including:

    <l>· American Express
    <l>· Mastercard
    <l>· Visa
    <l>· Bank of America
    <l>· Bank One
    <l>· Barclaycard
    <l>· Citi Group
          <l> · Discover
    <l>· Garanti Bank
    <l>· GE
    <l>· HSBC
    <l>· MBNA
    <l>· US Bank
   <l>... and many others



     <h>Loyalty to telecoms companies and utilities
   <p>Telecoms operators across the world have tried a number of different
   techniques to nurture customer loyalty and reduce the almost
   inevitable churn produced by the current trends of number portability
   and mobile handset subsidies. Some operators have paired up with
   existing loyalty programmes while others have set up their own
   schemes. Yet others have chosen to run shorter-term promotions in
   their bids to both acquire and retain customers.

   <p>Much of the loyalty-related activity has come from the mobile telecoms
   sector, while fixed line providers - particularly in the USA - seem to
   have been concentrating more on the bundling of services, internet and
   cable broadband services, and improvements in service and customer
   satisfaction.

   <p>And much of the development in the utility sector in the past couple
   of years has been in the areas of improved quality and reliability of
   service - key hygiene issues for power and water providers at least -
   and also in the area of customer service and billing system
   improvements.

     <h>Loyalty in non-profit, healthcare & other sectors
   <p>In our chapter on loyalty to the charitable, educational, healthcare
   and government sectors, we examine donor relationship management,
   healthcare loyalty initiatives, and other citizen loyalty and
   relationship initiatives, including government and private sector
   operations. Covering the various options available for cause-related
   marketing, fund raising, as well as various lifestyle and
   self-improvement programmes, we explain where the successes have been,
   and why, and how they did it. The key topics covered in the chapter
   include charity & community initiatives, education loyalty and reward
   schemes, government initiatives (including e-government and citizen
   relationship management), healthcare loyalty programmes and lifestyle
   improvement initiatives, and loyalty programme and technology
   developments in a variety of other sectors.

   <h>Metrics and Analysis to support your loyalty initiative
   <p>The business case for any loyalty programme needs to be well supported
   and justified, not only in the planning stages but on a continuing
   basis after implementation, and during development. The application of
   solid mathematics, statistics, and scientific measurement is the only
   way to prove the effect the programme is likely to have on
   profitability and the customer base. And the application of regular
   and meaningful management reporting is the only way to monitor all the
   factors involved both before and after implementation of the
   programme.

   <p>In the report, we provide full and detailed explanations of the
   various metrics, formulae, and indexes that build the scientific case
   for customer loyalty, analysing every last detail of customer
   behaviour, transactional data, and even demographics. A range of
   ratios and comparisons are included that provide business decision
   support, along with mission-critical financial and customer-flow
   reports that guide strategy decisions across the board, covering

   calculations; Analysis reports and tools; and RFM segmentation.

   <h>What's the future of loyalty?
   <p>The only feasible way of predicting trends is to examine what has
   happened so far and then make projections from that. Of course even
   that is fraught with danger because paradigm shifts have a nasty habit
   of turning up just when least expected. Who would have predicted even
   ten years ago that the mail and the fax would have been relegated to
   the extent that they have by e-mail? There is also an apocryphal
   observation, attributed to many different origins, about what would
   have been predicted had the microchip been around to help in the late
   eighteen hundreds. Apparently, horse-drawn traffic in London was
   increasing in volume so quickly that it would have been quite
   reasonable to predict that by 1970 the whole of London would be thirty
   feet deep in horse manure!

   <p>The traps, pitfalls, and warnings of the past have always been useful
   for planning action in the future - the worse the failure, the more
   widely the lesson is learned. Likewise the success of the past rapidly
   become role models for the future. But at the pace with which
   technology, retailers, service providers, general commerce, and even
   consumers are shifting and changing, the time has come to use
   increasingly predictive science to find the pitfalls before we reach
   them. In some sectors - particularly those where churn is
   traditionally high (such as freshly deregulated and highly saturated
   industries) - the very survival of a business may depend on its
   ability to see into the future. Make sure you know what's coming!
