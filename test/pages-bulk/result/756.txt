   <h>How to see and READ the AURA: Part 3 [1x1pix.gif]

     <h>Seeing the Aura
     <p>This exercise is designed to see Aura for the first time and/or
     practice seeing Auras. Choosing good conditions is important: not
     only you see the Aura better, but also to gain a confidence about
     what you see.
    <l>1. Situate the person in front of a very softly illuminated PLAIN
       WHITE background. A color background will change Aura colors, so
       you need additional knowledge about combining colors. Some
       combinations of background and Aura colors may cause
       misinterpretation problems.
    <l>2. Choose ONE SPOT to look at. The middle of the forehead is VERY
       GOOD. This is a location of so called Brow Chakra or the Third
       Eye. In some cultures (India) they put a mark on a forehead. Such
       a mark in ancient times could mean the invitation to look and see
       the Aura.
    <l>3. Look at this spot for 30 to 60 seconds or longer
    <l>4. After 30 seconds analyze surroundings with your peripheral vision,
       while still looking at the same spot. Continuing the concentration
       is most important. Resist temptation to look around. You should
       see that the background nearby the person is brighter and has a
       DIFFERENT color than the background further away. This is your own
       perception of the Aura. The longer you concentrate, the better you
       will see it. Remember, concentration on one spot increases your
       sensitivity by accumulating the effect of the Aura vibration
       reaching your eyes.

     <h>Taking a SNAPSHOT of an Aura.
     <p>After concentrating long enough to see the aura, close your eyes.
     For a second or two you will see the Aura ONLY. Be prepared. You
     have only one second or two until your photosensitive cells will
     stop vibrating and sending visual sensations to the brain. And if
     you miss is, you have to start concentrating again. Try to
     experiment how fast or slow you should close your eyes.

     <h>Observing auras of other people
     <p>The best is to look directly at someone's brow chakra (third eye or
     wisdom eye, which is located @1.5 cm above the nose, between eyes)
     and aim to achieve the state of mind similar to the concentration
     technique described above for at least 30-60 seconds. I have tried
     also looking at throat and heart chakras with similar results.
     However, if you concentrate on someone's chest it looks so unusual
     that the person concerned is usually very uneasy about it. When you
     look into someone's brow chakra you can actually continue
     conversation.
     <p>Again, VERY softly illuminated background, with no shadows is best.
     With practice, any uniformly illuminated background (such as a blue
     sky for example) will suffice.
     <h>How to see your own Aura
     <p>Stand about 1.5 m in front of a good size mirror. In the beginning
     it is best if the background behind you is plain white and there
     are no shadows. Illumination should be VERY soft and uniform not
     bright. Follow instructions above for seeing Auras.
     <p>PRACTICE for at least 10-15 minutes each day to increase your
     sensitivity and develop Auric sight. Remember that practice is
     required to develop Auric sight.
     <h>Auric sight and after-images 
     <p>One of the most frequently asked questions during my workshops is:
     "Tom, are my eyes playing tricks on me ?" The answer is no, you
     have just learnt to pay attention to what your eyes are capable of.
     Light sensors in our eyes (Red Green and Blue) are vibration
     sensors which are highly non-linear and they have memory. The
     consequence of memory is that they can oscillate for up to several
     seconds after the visual stimulation has been discontinued.
     <p>This memory of visual stimulation is frequently perceived as
     afterimage. Afterimages have a precisely the same shape as original
     images. Afterimage of an object surrounded by its Aura is larger
     than the original image. The increase in such afterimage is due to
     the vibration of an Aura and actually represents a "snapshot" of an
     Aura. It is therefore essential to focus at one spot when watching
     the Aura and resist temptation to change the point of focus,
     otherwise an image of the Aura may become confused with the
     afterimage of an object.
     <h>Meaning of Aura and its colors
     <p>The Aura is a reflection of our True Nature at any given moment. At
     this point it is perhaps necessary to explain what do I mean by
     "True Nature" and why some effort is necessary to "discover" it.
     Our society seems to emphasize symbols, stereotypes, habits,
     manners, superficial behavior, pretending, following others and
     submitting free will to some "leaders". Our "education" seems to be
     based on views and expectations of people who try to control the
     flock.
     <p>Our True Nature is what is left when we recognize and discard all
     our habits, stereotypes, manners, and pretending, superficial
     behavior and become fully conscious, truly natural and spontaneous.
     Note that some people are so attached to their manners and habits
     that it is very hard, if not impossible, to discover who they
     really are. The only way to get an instant insight into their
     personality seems to be by watching their Aura, because the Aura
     shows their True Nature, behind any facade of superficial behavior.
     <p>In general, the more colorful, cleaner and brighter the Aura, the
     better and more spiritually advanced is the person. Also, the more
     uniform the energy distribution in the Aura, the healthier and more
     balanced the person is.
     <p>Distribution of the energy in the Aura seems to have the potential
     of a powerful medical diagnostic tool, but usually requires using a
     complex equipment. The scope of this article is to concentrate on
     what we can easily see with our eyes.
     <p>Our Aura surrounds the entire body, but the interpretation of
     colors below relates to the Aura around the head only. Meaning of
     colors around the head presented below suggested in the literature
     has been confirmed by the author. When you learn to see Aura well,
     you can verify it for yourself, by concentrating on certain
     thoughts while watching your Aura, or telling people what their
     thoughts are when you see their Auras.
     <p>Usually, people have one or two dominating colors (strong points)
     in their Aura. These colors (or their Auric pairs) will be most
     likely their favorite colors.
     <p>In addition to dominant colors, the Aura reflects thoughts,
     feelings and desires, which appear like "flashes", "clouds" or
     "flames", usually further away from the head. For example a flash
     of orange in the Aura indicates a thought or desire to exercise
     power and control. Orange as a dominant color is a sign of power
     and general ability to control people. Quickly changing "flashes"
     indicate quickly changing thoughts.
     <h>Meaning of Clean Colors of the Aura
     (colors of the rainbow, bright, shiny, monochromatic colors):
     <p>Purple: indicates spiritual thoughts. Purple is never a strong
     point in the Aura. It appears only as temporary "clouds" and
     "flames", indicating truly spiritual thoughts.
     <p>Blue: Balanced existence, sustaining life, eased nerve system,
     transmitting forces and energy. People with blue strong point in
     their Aura are relaxed, balanced and feel ready to live in a cave
     and survive. They are born survivors. Blue thought is a thought
     about relaxing the nerve system to achieve the balance of the mind
     or a thought about surviving. Electric blue can override any other
     color in the Aura, when the person is receiving and/or transmitting
     information in a telepathic communication. For example Michel
     Desmarquet, author of "Thiaoouba Prophecy", frequently glows with
     the electric blue during his lectures, especially when he answers
     questions from the public.
     <p>Turquoise: indicates dynamic quality of being, highly energized
     personality, capable of projection, influencing other people.
     People with turquoise strong point in their Aura can do many things
     simultaneously and are good organizers. They feel bored when forced
     to concentrate on one thing. People love bosses with turquoise
     Auras, because such bosses explain their goals and influence their
     team rather than demand executing their commands. Turquoise thought
     is a thought about organizing and influencing others.
     <p>Green: restful, modifying energy, natural healing ability. All
     natural healers should have it. People with a green strong point in
     their Auras are natural healers. The stronger the green Aura, the
     better the healer. They also love gardening and usually have a
     "green hand" - anything grows for them. Being in a presence of a
     person with a strong and green Aura is a very peaceful and restful
     experience. Green thought indicates a restful state and healing.
     <p>Yellow: joy, freedom, non-attachment, freeing or releasing vital
     forces. People who glow yellow are full of inner joy, very generous
     and not attached to anything. Yellow halo around the head: high
     spiritual development. A signature of a spiritual teacher. Do not
     accept spiritual teachings from anyone who does not have such a
     yellow halo. Buddha and Christ had yellow halos extending to their
     arms. Today it is rare on Earth to find a person with a halo larger
     than 1 inch. Yellow halo appears as a result of a highly active
     brow chakra (which can be seen glowing with violet by many people
     at my workshops). Highly spiritual people stimulate the brow chakra
     continuously for many years, because they always have intensive
     spiritual thoughts in their minds. When this chakra is observed
     when highly active, a yellow (Auric pair) halo appears around it,
     surrounding the entire head. Yellow thought indicates a moment of
     joy and contentment.
     <p>Orange: uplifting and absorbing. Inspiring. A sign of power.
     Ability and/or desire to control people. When orange becomes a
     strong point, it usually contributes to a yellow halo, which then
     becomes gold, indicating not only a spiritual teacher, but a
     powerful spiritual teacher, someone capable of demonstrating
     his/her unique abilities. Orange thought is a thought about
     exercising power or a desire to control people.
     <p>Red: materialistic thoughts, thoughts about the physical body.
     Predominantly red Aura indicates materialistically oriented person.
     <p>Pink (=purple+red): love (in a spiritual sense). To obtain a clean
     pink, you need to mix the purple (the highest frequency we
     perceive) with red (the lowest frequency). Pink Aura indicates that
     the person achieved a perfect balance between spiritual awareness
     and the material existence. The most advanced people have not only
     a yellow halo around the head (a permanent strong point in the
     Aura) but also a large pink Aura extending further away. The pink
     color in the Aura is quite rare on Earth and appears only as a
     temporary thought, never as a strong point in the Aura.

     <h>Meaning of Dirty colors:
     (colors appearing darker than background more like a smoke than a
     glow)
     <p>Brown: unsettling, distracting, materialistic, negating
     spirituality.
     <p>Gray: dark thoughts, depressing thoughts, unclear intentions,
     presence of a dark side of personality.
     <p>Sulfur (color of a mustard): pain or lack of ease, anger
     <p>White: serious disease, artificial stimulation (drugs). Why does
     the white color in the Aura indicate problems? White color is like
     a noise, rather than a set of harmonious tones (monochromatic
     colors). It is impossible to "tune" the noise to an orchestra
     playing harmonious music, hence the white Aura indicates a lack of
     harmony in the body and mind. Nature, which we are a part of, is
     harmonious. This harmony comes in discrete vibration "tones" or
     harmonics, partially described by the modern quantum physics.
     Several hours before the death, the Aura becomes white, and greatly
     increases in intensity. For this reason in most cultures "death" is
     depicted in WHITE (not black), because in the past, people could
     actually see a white Aura before death. It seems that our ancestors
     knew much more than we are prepared to admit.
     <h>Amplifying your Aura vibration and bio-energy
     <p>Things which can greatly amplify your aura are:
    <l>1. Meditation (purifying your mind from any thoughts)
    <l>2. Concentration exercise with the cross
    <l>3. Matching your aura with the environment
