   <h>Les Suites Taipei - Ching Cheng

   <p>"Classy clubby petite hideaway hotel in down-town Taipei"

   <p>While away a rainy Taipei afternoon in any of the luxurious lounges
   listening to jazz and perusing the eclectic collection of coffee table
   books.

      <h>The Travel Intelligence review:
   <p>
   Caroline Major
   <p>Tucked behind a high chocolate wall, on the corner of the first lane
   opposite the McDonalds outside Nanjing East MRT station, Les Suites is
   a hideaway in a city frenetic in its pursuit of the manufacture of
   things. More, it is Taipeis only small contemporary hotel and its
   assembled with a relaxed and timeless style. Bravo!
   <p>Charcoal and chocolate, silver and aubergine, olive and gold and black
   and white are all mixed together with mood lighting, textural interest
   and jazzy style. Plenty of space for luxury lounging gives the ground
   floor a clubby feel helped along by an ever present selection of
   complimentary nibbles and drinks. Youll want to linger around to enjoy
   the books, get online, read the papers or maybe tuck your feet under
   you and curl up with a cup of tea, slippers abandoned on the floor.
   The hotel is for guests only and the lack of a traditional lobby is
   cosy and charming.
   <p>Upstairs theres five choices of room where even the small entry level
   offering is inviting (if only for sleeping). Small touches are the
   work of an owner whos spent a lot of time in business hotels and
   wanted more. The mini-bar is complemented with an always-on urn of
   boiling water for serving yourself with the kinds of instant noodles
   you can only get in Asia, or for brewing up a real pot of tea. Hi tech
   continues on the bedside panel for room controls. Alarm, lights,
   temperature, world time and curtains all function with light touch
   digital. Perhaps the most fun though, is the Toto toilet, bringing
   into favour a choice of three wash cycles and a warm air dry in easy
   reach on a wall panel. Maybe itll change your routine forever! Wi-fi
   and broadband are of course standard and fast in super-tech Taiwan.
   Though not in the toilet - yet.
   <p>Breakfast is served downstairs in the lounge and cleared away promptly
   at ten am when its replaced with the tea selection. There is no
   restaurant, but who needs it in a bustling district full of fabulous
   local alternatives? The gym is small but with well enough chosen
   equipment to get a good work-out in. Room-service is available between
   eleven pm and two am but is nothing special. Youll get better value
   with those exotic instant noodles from the mini-bar.
   <p>Les Suite is a welcome alternative to the multi story behemouths
   prevalent in this city, and is a great space for lounging around in
   those out of business hours if you feel like staying in and chilling
   instead of going out on the town. Thats an achievement for a business
   hotel. It feels as much like home as a hotel can. Book early as the
   Japanese, Hong Kongese and the Singaporeans are wise to the secret and
   the occupancy here, alongside its sister hotel a few blocks away on
   Da-An Road, run high.
   <p>Find a refuge from Taipei's hectic pace at Les Suites Taipei. Taipei,
   the world's most sprawling city, is a complex and dynamic urban
   landscape well-known for its cutting-edge, high-tech efficiency.
   Ideally located in Taipei's premier financial and business district,
   Les Suites Taipei offers a tranquil home-away-from home atmosphere.
   Exquisite taste and syle make this one of Taipei's finest hotels.
   The Hotel's 90 rooms, including 16 suites and one VIP suite, achieve a
   new standard in the heart of Taipei. Guest quarters are remarkably
   spacious, with contemporary furnishings befitting a hotel in one of
   the world's most technologically advanced cities. Each room is
   equipped to meet the needs of the modern business traveler and help
   manage the demands of international travel.
