  <p> Gurgaon, January 2
   In the face of hovering war clouds and the increased campaign of the
   Pakistan-aided militants in the country, the Centre has asked the
   Haryana Government to invigorate its intelligence and internal
   security system.

   <p>According to sources, the Union Home Ministry has communicated to the
   state government the need to tighten its intelligence and security
   system. The state government has directed the deputy commissioners and
   all authorities concerned for follow up action in compliance with the
   Central directive.

   <p>According to observers such directives from the Centre are issued only
   at the time of emergency, especially on or before war and is sent to
   all states.

   <p>According to reports, almost all of the district administrations in
   Haryana have swung into action following the communication from the
   state government.

   <p>Although the directive of the Centre covers the entire state, some of
   the districts, especially the ones falling under National Capital
   Region (NCR) and south Haryana are the most sensitive. Also, the areas
   bordering Sriganganagar district in Rajasthan, which are closer to
   Indo-Pakistan border are said to be on the watch list of the Haryana
   security forces.

  <p> Gurgaon, Faridabad, Jhajjar and Sonepat districts are said to be under
   special vigil.

   <p>The Gurgaon administration has launched a drive as a follow-up action.
   the Administration is in the midst of issuing a order for stepping up
   drive to get the identities of the tenants in the district verified.
   The cut-off date for ascertaining the identities was December 1. The
   domestic workers and guards could also fall in the ambit. The onus to
   inform the police lies on the landlords and those who employ
   domestics. A senior member of the administration said the order would
   be issued with in 24 hours.

  <p> The proposed order specifically covers the Mewat area of this
   district. Of late, Mewat areas falling in Gurgaon and Faridabad
   districts have proved to be happy hunting ground for the Pakistans
   ISI. Recently the CBI conducted raids in villages of Mewat and seized
   arms and ammunition. A native of Mewat was caught while carrying arms
   in Gujarat to be used by terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir. There have
   been other occasions when Mewat residents were nabbed acting as agents
   of the ISI and carrying fire arms and explosives.

   <p>The ammunition depot of the Indian Force and corporate offices of
   various multinational companies, are also located here.

   <p>Also, Theekri pehra (night vigil by villagers) will be enforced. The
   onus for it will lie on the sarpanch and numberdar of the villages
   concerned.

   <p>The sources said such measures were likely to be followed in all
   districts of Haryana.

  <p> Chandigarh, January 2
   Even as considerable heat has been generated in Haryana over various
   steps taken by the state government in the power sector, the Power
   Utilities have played it safe by not proposing any increase in tariff
   during the next financial year.

   <p>The proposed ARR (annual revenue requirement) for the year 2002-2003,
   submitted by the utilities to the Haryana Electricity Regulatory
   Commission, gives the impression that there will no increase in power
   tariff. The proposal, submitted by the Power Utilities on the evening
   of December 31 was not accompanied with any tariff application.

   <p>There is a gap of Rs 110 crore between the expenditure and the
   earnings of the utilities in the latest ARR . However, instead of
   asking for an increase in tariff, the utilities proposed the
   formulation of regulatory assets to the commission for managing the
   shortfall in revenue collection.

  <p> Asked if the absence of a tariff application in the ARR proposal
   indicated that there would be no increase in power tariff in
   2002-2003, an official of the utilities, said: We felt that a review
   of the tariff structure was not necessary for the time being.

   <p>Sources said that since the erstwhile HSEB was split up, three ARR
   proposals, including the one given on December 31, had been submitted
   by the utilities to the HERC. The first ARR, submitted for 2000-2001,
   did not have any tariff proposal as part of it and at that time also
   the utilities had suggested the formulation of regulatory assets for
   managing the gap between expenditure and revenue collection. The HERC
   accepted the utilities request and there was no increase in tariff for
   that year.

   <p>The next ARR, for 2001-2002, submitted by the utilities was
   accompanied with a tariff application. The tariff application was
   examined by the HERC by going through the formal procedures following
   which it passed its order.

   <p>Though the utilities did not file any tariff application with its ARR
   this time, the HERC, after examining the ARR and going through the
   process of public hearing, may still ask the utilities to review the
   prevailing tariff structure, an official said.

   <p>The utilities, too, may submit an application to the HERC later if it
   feels the need for reviewing the tariff, they add.

 
                       <h> BSP set to shed Dalit image
                           Tribune News Service 

   <p>Panipat, January 2
   The BSP is all set to shed its Dalit image and with that end in view
   it may even field a non-Dalit candidate for the February 21
   Yamunanagar Assembly by-election.

   <p>An indication to this effect was given by Mr Ashok Sherwal, president
   of the Haryana unit of the party, here today. All efforts would be
   made to give the ticket to the candidate of a majority community which
   had gone unrepresented in Haryana Assembly, Mr Sherwal said, adding
   that the BSP would go all alone in the by-election.

   <p>This is the first time that the party had made a panel of about 15
   candidates on the caste basis. The candidate would be selected from
   among them on January 5 in consultation with the party high command.
   According to observers, there are about 35,000 Dalits and Punjabis
   each in the constituency followed by 25,000 Brahmins and 15,000
   Muslims.

   <p>Party sources said the candidate could be from outside the Assembly
   segment. There is likely to be a race for the ticket between the
   Punjabi and Dalit lobbies as in terms of strength, they were ahead of
   the order communities.

   <p>It may be recalled that in the last Assembly elections held in
   February 2,000, the BSP candidate, Mr Randhir Chaudhary, was placed
   third and had secured over 17,000 votes. The Congress candidate, Mr
   J.P. Sharma, whose death had necessitated the by-election, had won the
   seat by securing over 20,000 votes.

   <p>On Mr Chaudhary throwing in his lot with the rebel BSP leader, Mr Aman
   Kumar Nagra, Mr Sherwal claimed that this would not have any effect on
   partys fortunes in the election as the BSP had a committed vote-bank.
   The BSP was a cadre-based party wedded to a particular ideology and Mr
   Chaudharys departure would hardly have any impact on it, he quipped.

   <p>In fact, in the wake of changed political scenario in the state, the
   BSP stood a better chance to win the seat as the public was fed up
   with the Congress, the BJP and the INLD. Every party had misled the
   public and failed to fulfil the promises, he said.

   <p>Mr Sherwal feared large scale misuse of official machinery by the
   Chautala-led government. If this happened the party would approach the
   Election Commission, he said.

   <p>When asked whether the formation of the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) by
   the Union Coal Minister, Mr Ram Vilas Paswan, would divide the Dalit
   vote-bank, Mr Sherwal stated that the LJP was a marginal player in the
   national politics and had been propped up by the Congress and the BJP.

  


                   <h>  Consumers wary of new power policy
                             Our Correspondent 

  <p> Rohtak, January 2
   The defaulting electricity consumers in the rural areas appear to be
   wary of the new policy which proposes the delinking of current power
   bills from the outstanding bills.

   <p>As per the policy, interest and surcharge on outstanding bills would
   be waived and consumers asked to pay only the original bill according
   to their convenience.

   <p>Senior officers in the district and the ruling INLD functionaries on
   Monday visited the problem villages to educate consumers about the new
   policy and persuade them to pay current bills.

   <p>Encouraged by the response to the new scheme, the INLD yesterday
   launched a political offensive to isolate those who had been provoking
   farmers against the payment of the bills. Prominent persons belonging
   to the problem villages were invited for a meeting with Mr Dhir Pal
   Singh, Town and Country Planning Minister, here to sort out the
   problem to the satisfaction of consumers and HVPN officials.

   <p>Mr Dhir Pal Singh, claimed that the new policy was the only workable
   solution to the waxed problem. He advised defaulting consumers not to
   miss the opportunity and start a new chapter on New Year day.

   <p>Village leaders, appreciating the new policy, blamed HVPN officials
   also for the present situation.

   <p>They told the minister that HVPN officials never visited consumers for
   actual meter reading thereby forcing them to default in the payment of
   bills. The employees had not even distributed the bills among the
   consumers.

   <p>The Deputy Commissioner, Mr Anil Malik, assured that current bills
   would be distributed in a weeks time and HVPN officials would hold
   camps in their respective villages to rectify the faulty bills.

   <p>The district administration has, meanwhile, decided to launch a
   special campaign against kundi connections.

   <p>Mr Dhirpal Singh said certain leaders were misleading the farmers for
   their personal gains.

   <p>Among those who attended the meeting were Capt Inder Singh, MP, Mr
   Balwant Singh Myna, Mr Balbir Singh Bali, both MLAs, and Mr Dharam Pal
   Chairman, Zila Parishad.

                            Tribune News Service

   <p>Chandigarh, January 2

   centre in a school under the new education policy of Haryana will be
   relaxed for the Morni Hills. This was announced by the Chief Minister,
   Mr Om Prakash Chautala, while presiding over a meeting of the Shivalik
   Development Board here today.

   Sirsa on Monday last, had assured that his Ministry would finance the
   proposed magnificent tourist resort project of the state government at
   Tikkar Taal in the Morni area of Panchkula district.

   (Buildings and Roads), to strengthen the only road to Tikkar Tal. He
   said the bridges on small brooks should be constructed without any
   delay. Adequate drinking water should also be provided in all villages
   falling under the Shivalik Development Board.

   <p>He said developmental works should also be taken up expeditiously
   under the "Food for Work" programme in the areas falling under the
   board. He said apart from the Minor Irrigation and Tubewells
   Corporation(MITC), private parties should also be involved in the
   boring of deep irrigation tubewells.

   <p>He asked the MLA of Ambala city, Mrs Veena Chhibber, to submit a
   project for the development of Baldev Nagar camp, especially the roads
   of the area.

   <p>The chairperson of the power utilities, Mrs Meenaxi Anand Chaudhary,
   said electricity would be provided to the unelectrified hamlets of the
   Morni block in this calendar year. Solar lanterns were being
   popularised in the Morni area for domestic lighting.

  <p> The Commissioner, Ambala division, Mr Maha Singh, said a Rs
   100.62-crore project had been submitted to the Union Government for
   seeking assistance from the International Fund for Agricultural
   Development, Rome, for the integrated development of the Shivalik
   area.

  <p> The Chief Secretary, Mr L.M. Goyal, said there would not be any dearth
   of foodgrains under the Food for Work programme. Therefore, the
   resources under the programme should be used to the maximum for rural
   development in the area. EOM
