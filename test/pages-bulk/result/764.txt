                            Tribune News Service

   <p>Chandigarh, July 16
   The much-awaited Varishtha Pension Bima Yojna that promise a
   guaranteed 9 per cent return to the persons above 55 has attracted
   mixed response from the public. While the LIC is enthused by
   overwhelming response from the public, a section of senior citizens is
   still weighing the pros and cons of the scheme.

   <p>Ms Deba Shree Varma, Senior Divisional Manager, LIC, Chandigarh
   Division, claims, We have collected over Rs 1 crore premium within two
   days after the launch of the scheme. In fact, the senior citizens are
   looking for agents to buy the scheme. Reports from other regions
   revealed that the a large number of senior citizens are buying the
   product. Mr Janak Kumar, Senior Divisional Manager, LIC, Jalandhar
   Division, said: The senior citizens are investing up to the highest
   limit of Rs 2.66 lakh. We are sure that the Jalandhar division will
   garner over Rs 100 crore through the scheme.

   <p>However, Mr R.K. Kaplash, Vice-President, the Consumer Forum,
   Chandigarh, felt that the scheme is a mere eyewash. He said, the
   government has deceived the public by putting a condition of the
   15-year lock-in period and income tax on the returns from the scheme.
   He wondered how the senior citizens will benefit from the assured
   return of 9 per cent when they have to keep their savings for 15
   years. Further, the interest rate may increase in the coming years and
   the government has not made a provision of an increase in return in
   that case.

   <p>The pension scheme of the Postal Department is already offering a
   return of above 8 per cent. After income tax deductions the actual
   return will not be substantially higher than other schemes. He said,
   if the government really wants to help the middle class it should not
   have announced any lock-in period, or 10.5 per cent interest for the
   loans taken from the investment.

   <p>Another retired Army official said the condition that only one person
   can invest in the scheme had created a peculiar situation. The
   government should raise the investment limit up to atleast Rs 5 lakh
   and allow the couples to invest separately.

   <p>Ms Varma claimed that the LIC has plans to invest the amount in such
   areas where it will fetch at least 7 per cent returns. The government
   will have to subsidise the returns by just 2 per cent. Mr Janak Kumar
   claimed that all pension schemes are taxable under the Income Tax Act.
   However, there will be a small segment of the senior citizens who will
   have to pay the tax after standard deductions.


                    <h>Maruti boosts market share to 55 pc

   <p>Bangalore, July 16
   Maruti Udyog Limited (MUL) has increased its marketshare in domestic
   car market by 3.5 per cent to 55 per cent in this April-June compared
   with the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal, its Managing
   Director Jagdish Khattar said today.

   <p>While the car industry grew by 28 per cent in Q1 of 2003-04, Maruti
   grew by 37 per cent during the period, he told reporters here. After
   the car-maker signed an MoU with State Bank of Mysore on offering car
   financing in Karnataka.

   <p>Khattar said Maruti had already entered into an alliance on car
   finance with State Bank of India and State Bank of Patiala and would
   do so with State Bank of Indore and State Bank of Hyderabad in the
   next few days. Highlighting the importance of car financing, he said
   the share of car financing in percentage of sales by the car industry
   in India had gone up from 50 per cent five years ago to 75 per cent
   now. PTI

   <p>Chandigarh, July 16
   Pakistan industrialists are hopeful that efforts of the political
   leadership in India and Pakistan to improve relations will open new
   vistas of economic development.

   <p>Opening of trade between both countries will be mutually beneficial
   and contribute to the economic development of the region, said Mr
   Aslam Anjum Chaudhary, Chairman, the Standing Committee on Trade and
   Cottage Industries (FPCCI), Pakistan, and member of the Pakistani
   business delegation, currently on visit to India.

   <p>In an interview to The Tribune, he claimed that Pakistani
   industrialists are impressed by the technology developments in India,
   especially in the field of IT, pharmaceutical and engineering sectors.

   <p>Though some people are scared that India will gain in a big way, the
   Pakistan industry will also substantially gain from the trade.

   <p>Later, he said, the Indian companies can have joint ventures with in
   Pakistan to explore markets in other countries as well.

   <p>Mr Chaudhary is also the President, Sargodha Chamber of Commerce &
   Industry and Vice- Chairman of the Faisalabad Dry Port (Trust). He
   deals with export and import of fruits, tyres, textile, chemicals and
   engineering goods.

  <p> He was here to explore the import of Swaraj Tractors. There was an
   annual demand of over 40,000 tractors in Pakistan. Though Massey
   Ferguson and Fiat were major brands there but the industry has good
   scope.

  <p> At present the imports of engineering and pharmaceutical goods from
   India are on the negative list, but the industry is hopeful that the
   present government will allow to import these goods.

   <p>The government has already allowed the import of tyres and tubes and
   some other goods from India. Further, by the end of 2004, under WTO
   conditions both countries will have to open trade, he added.

   <p>He disclosed in the field of textile, leather and agricultural
   commodities both countries can start trade. The current trade was
   pegged at about $2 billion. With the improvement in economic ties, the
   trade can double immediately.

   <p>Regarding the threat to the local industry, Mr Chaudhary said Chinese
   goods were popular in his country and Indian manufacturers will have
   to compete with them.

   <p>However, he said, due to lower transport costs, it will be more
   profitable for Pakistanis to purchase tractors, automobiles and other
   goods from India. Similarly India can import leather, textile and
   agricultural products from Pakistan at a much cheaper rate.

   <p>Amritsar, July 16
   The Governments of India and Pakistan must share the blame for keeping
   the region poverty-stricken as large funds were being wasted on
   military, remarks the Vice-Chairman of Saarc business group in
   Pakistan, Mr Jamil Ahmad Magoon.

   <p>Talking to exclusively to The Tribune reporter today after winding up
   the 12 day visit Mr Magoon said both the countries must decide to
   remove all restrictions for a free trade zone which will benefit both
   the countries and bring prosperity.

   <p>Mr Magoon, who had also met the Prime Minister in Delhi, had requested
   him to take positive steps to build up trade ties and ease visa
   restrictions so that Pakistan businessmen can come freely without any
   hurdles. This will usher an era of trust and mutual faith which had
   been lacking between both the countries due to animosity for the past
   many decades.

   <p>He said India can offer a large number of items, including machinery
   of all kinds, chemicals and dyes, medicines, tea, spices and large
   quantity of other essential item while Pakistan can offer rock salt,
   sugar, dry fruits, crude drugs, etc.

   <p>The delegation is confident that India must offer access to Pakistani
   goods while providing services and technical know-how and various
   other items in return. Pakistan is not over awed by Indias development
   and will welcome all possible concessions for much smaller country
   like Pakistan.

   <p>Earlier the delegation visited the multi-speciality Escort Heart
   Institute.



               <h> Consultations on for unified licence regime
                            Tribune News Service

   <p>New Delhi, July 16
   TRAI today began the consultation process for migrating towards a
   unified licence regime aimed at bringing cellular and fixed line
   service providers under on licensing structure. In a consultation
   paper issued today, TRAI has sought opinion of stakeholders on
   migrating from a service specific regime to a unified licensing
   regime, which is prevalent in a number of countries and has recently
   been mandated for the EU member nations.

   <p>A unified licensing regime would enable service providers to offer
   both fixed and mobile services. This would benefit the service
   providers and consumers, as there would be efficiency gains through
   synergies of infrastructure, networks and services, a TRAI press
   release said.

   <p>In India, the basic and cellular mobile services have been licensed
   separately. However, a certain amount of convergence in the terms and
   conditions of licence already exist such as both the basic and
   cellular service providers pay the same annual licence fees, both the
   service providers have common access to Universal Service Fund and can
   offer mobility.

   <p>The TRAI consultations will cover entry fees, extent of mobility, roll
   out obligation, performance bank guarantee, and spectrum allocation
   procedure.

   <p>Along with these, there are some other issues pertaining to
   inteconnection, number etc, will also be discussed.

   <p>Mergers and acquisition have been quite common in the industry over
   the recent years. However, intra-circle mergers, which are of a
   horizontal nature, have not been permitted so far. Creation of a
   unified licence would result in a larger number of players offering
   the same basket of services, and may lead to the need of allowing
   intra-circle mergers and acquisitions, the TRAI statement said.
