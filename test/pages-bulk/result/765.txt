   <h>Sarv Shiksha drive a boon for girl students

   <p>CONCERNED at the high dropout rate in schools, a declining sex ratio
   and a marked difference in literacy levels of boys and girls of the
   city, the Sarv Shiksha Abhiyan has come as a boon for girl students
   with the scheme offering free textbooks to them till the primary level
   and free computer education upto Class VIII.

   <p>TEACHERS and other employees of non-government aided colleges of
   Punjab and Chandigarh are, once again, protesting against the denial
   of their long-standing demands. They are asking for pension, gratuity
   and other benefits. And once again, the academic atmosphere is bound
   to be disturbed, then their demands conceded with customary fanfare
   and then, as always, completely forgotten.
    


                <h>Sarv Shiksha drive a boon for girl students
                             Geetanjali Gayatri
   <p>CONCERNED at the high dropout rate in schools, a declining
   sex ratio and a marked difference in literacy levels of boys and girls
   of the city, the Sarv Shiksha Abhiyan has come as a boon for girl
   students with the scheme offering free textbooks to them till the
   primary level and free computer education upto Class VIII.

   <p>While the girl students in government schools were exempted from
   payment of tuition fee till Class XII, the benefit of free textbooks
   has come as an added advantage, making studies practically free for
   them. Sanctioned under Innovative projects of the SSA, the incentive
   is aimed at educating the girlchild and reducing the gap in literacy
   levels between boys and girls.

   <p>We had been alarmed at the decreasing number of girl students in
   classrooms. when SSA came our way, We prepared a special project on
   the education scenario in the city with special reference to the girl
   child and presented it to the Government of India. Taking note of our
   concerns, we were given a sum of Rs 50 lakh under the project to
   uplift the girl child, says Mr DS Mangat, DPI (Schools), Chandigarh.

<p>Of the total amount sanctioned for the project under SSA, Rs
   35 lakh have been given for distribution of free textbooks till Class
   V to all girl students and another Rs 15 lakh have come for imparting
   computer education to them. Computers are taught from Class V to Class
   VIII in government schools.

   <p>Though this project is to be implemented from this month onwards, with
   most students already having bought the books for this session, the
   Chandigarh Education Department is likely to reimburse the amount
   spent by the students.

   <p>With the sex ratio coming down from 790 in 1991 to 773 in 2001, the
   city has a dropout rate of 17.92 per cent in the case of girls against
   7.94 per cent of boys at the upper primary level. Though the literacy
   level has gone up from 70.43 per cent in 1971 to 81.76 per cent, the
   literacy rate is higher among boys at 85.65 against 76.65 per cent
   among girls.

   <p>The low literacy level among girls in the city is attributed to the
   unwillingness of parents, especially those staying in slums, to send
   girls to school. They prefer to send them to work in houses nearby and
   add to the family's meagre income instead of spending on fee and
   books.

   <p>Interestingly, the census survey revealed that 18,614 girls were going
   to school against 21, 198 boys till the primary level while the total
   number of girls attending school from Class VI to VIII was 11,425
   against 12, 515 boys.



              <h> Govts fail to keep word with college teachers
                              Avanindra Chopra

   <p>TEACHERS and other employees of non-government aided colleges of
   Punjab and Chandigarh are, once again, protesting against the denial
   of their long-standing demands. They are asking for pension, gratuity
   and other benefits. And once again, the academic atmosphere is bound
   to be disturbed, then their demands conceded with customary fanfare
   and then, as always, completely forgotten.

   <p>In 1992 the Punjab government made a promise that these employees
   would be granted pension and other benefits on a par with their
   counterparts in government colleges. Many agitations later, some
   drafts of pension schemes (usually with modifications contrary to the
   interests of the employees), were approved by subsequent governments.
   But none implemented. The party in power today highlighted this just
   and genuine demand in its manifesto during their election campaign.
   And there the matter rests moribund.

   <p>Meanwhile, employees of such colleges are a demoralised lot. Many have
   since retired with meagre retiral benefits. This is so because the
   amounts due to them as gratuity are seldom paid. The amount of
   Contributory Provident Fund they received is not even half of their
   lawful entitlement since the statutory provisions concerning the
   deduction of subscription to their C.P.F are disregarded by college
   managements and funding governments.

   <p>For instance, in case of such colleges in Chandigarh and Punjab,
   affiliated to Panjab University, and funded by the Chandigarh
   Administration and the Government of Punjab, respectively, the
   deduction of the subscription to the employees C.P.F. is calculated at
   the rate of 10% of their basic pay alone. This contravenes the
   relevant provisions of the P.U. calendar, which clearly state that the
   rate of subscription shall be 10% of salary and salary for C.P.F.
   deductions means pay plus all allowances excluding HRA.

   <p>The exclusion of other allowances, like D.A., while calculating
   subscription to C.P.F. several truncates the only means of sustenance
   such employees have after retirement.

   <p>It needs to be noted that Panjab University, which gets grants from
   both Punjab and the Chandigarh Administration, follows these rules for
   its own employees. It contributes a matching 10% subscription on the
   basic and DA to its own employees, but allows colleges to get away
   with this step-motherly treatment to their employees. In the process,
   it ignores its statutory duty to oversee that its service rules and
   Provident Fund provisions are scrupulously followed by affiliated
   colleges.

  <p> Even the Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act,
   1952, clearly defines that the salary wages for C.P.F. deductions
   shall include basic wages, dearness allowances, (including cash value
   of any food concession) and retaining allowances if any.

   <p>Thus, the general, overriding, mandatory provision in the Act, the
   bedrock of all P.F. legislation in India, and the rules framed by
   Panjab University, are not being followed in the colleges affiliated
   with Panjab University.

   <p>It must be mentioned that the rate of deduction from salary for C.P.F.
   has been enhanced by the Centre from 10% to 12% with effect from May1,
   1997. No such enhancement on even the basic pay has been granted to
   the employees of the colleges.

   <p>Thus, for the past so many years, while teachers and other employees
   have been awaiting implementation of a viable pension policy, they
   have lost out on their legitimate claims as regards C.P.F. Umpteem
   representations to the authorities concerned have failed to yield any
   results.

   <p>Another distressing trend is discernible. It seems that in a bid to
   escape paying permissible dues like annual increments, D.A., H.R.A. or
   C.P.F., the powers that be are devising novel methods. New
   recruitments, if any, are mostly on ad hoc, contractual and temporary
   basis. These appointees are not entitled to any of the statutory
   allowances.
