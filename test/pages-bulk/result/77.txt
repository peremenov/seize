   <h>    Introduction:
   
  <p>  AHLUL- BAYT Islamic Centre, commonly known as HUSSIANIA is a purpose
   built
   NATIONAL IRISH SHI'A MUSLIM ISLAMIC CENTRE. It is the only Shi'a
   Muslim
   Islamic centre in Ireland including the Northern Ireland. Its aims and
   objectives are to
   serve the social , cultural and spritual needs of the entire Shi'a
   Muslim population of
   Ireland. There are about 1000 Shi'a Muslims working, studying and
   living in Ireland.
   
    <h>   Historical Background:
   
 <p>   The foundation of HUSSIANIA was laid down some time during the 1970's
   by a few Shi'a
   Muslim medical students, who came to Dublin from the Middle Eastern
   countries to study
   at the Royal College of surgeon, Dublin. These students hired a small
   house in the
   Portobello area of Dublin and then after a few years when this place
   was not big enough to
   accommodate every one, they moved to a bigger house in Rathgar.
   Gradually this place
   become known to other Shi'a Muslims living and working in Ireland.
   After a few years
   later even this house was not big enough to cater for the religious
   and spiritual needs of
   Irish Shi'a Muslim community. It was time to find a bigger and better
   space to serve
   properly the socio-cultural and religious needs of this small but
   growing Shi'a Muslim
   community of Ireland. During the 1990's the local Irish Shi'a Muslim
   community decided
   to build a proper Shi'a Muslim Islamic Center. They tapped on their
   own resources and
   constructed a purpose built center in the Milltown area of Dublin 14.
   Hussainia, Ahlul
   -Bait Shi'a Islamic Center was officially opened in September 1996.
   
  <p>  A full time resident Imam- Sayyed Ali Abdullah decided to return to
   Ireland in order to
   assume his official duty as a religious head of this center. He is a
   noble and qualified Shi'a
   Muslim religious scholar from the highest Muslim academic institution
   of Qum, Iran
   (known as Hawza ).
   
 <p>   The Imam of this Hussainia is not only responsible for the Islamic
   needs of the Shi'a
   Muslim community of Ireland but also anyone interested in the religion
   of Islam and
   Islamic world.
   
   <h>    Activity:
   
 <p>  The center is an active and thriving Islamic institution and is open
   every day for the after
   noon and evening prayers (salaa) it also conducts Dua Kumayal (special
   supplication) on
   every Thursday after the evening prayers. The center regularly holds
   lectures on various
   Islamic topics and issues on every Saturday from 8 PM. These lectures
   are open to
   anyone wishes to come along and are free of charge. The center offers
   a Friday afternoon
   prayer a recommended ritual through out the Islamic world. It conducts
   special occasion
   ceremonies through out the year. The Shi'a Muslim Islamic calendar is
   full of such special
   occasions for example birth and death anniversaries of twelve Imams or
   Ahlul Bayt i.e. the
   family of Prophet Mohammed (p.b.u.h) and his progeny (Aimmah).

   <h>    What is Islam?

  <p>  Islam consists of beliefs, which are the fundamental principals
   (roots) of the religion, and practices, which are the branches of the
   religion: 
   
    <p>    A. Usool Al-Deen (Roots of the religion): 
     <l>     1. Taw'heed (Oneness of GOD): Taw'heed means God is one. He has
            neither a colleague nor a partner. He begets not, nor is He
            begotten, there is non like Him.
   <l>       2. Adl (Justice of GOD): It means that Got is Just. He will
            reward or punish any person according to his deeds.
   <l>       3. Nobo'wa (Prophethood): A Nabi (prophet ) excels all other
            person for whom he is sent by Allah. He is Masoom ( sinless).
            PROPHIT MUHAMMAD MUSTAFA(blessings of Allah be on him and his
            progeny) is the last of the Prophets sent by Him. The
            Prophets sent by Allah including our Prophet, totals one
            hundred and twenty-four thousand.
  <l>        4. Imama (Vicegerncy of the prophet): Nobo'wa (prophethood)
            ended with Prophet Muhammad (pbum). The Imam has his
            Knowledge from GOD and his verdict is the verdict of GOD.
            Imams are twelve and they are the only rightful Imams. There
            is no successor to the Twelfth Imam . He is Alive but
            invisible in accordance with the will of Allah and will
            reappear when he commands, which will signify the coming end
            of the World.
  <l>        5. Qiyama (The judgment day): Is the day when GOD brings all of
            us to life after death, in order to be judged on what we did
            in our lives.
	    
   <p>     B. Foroo'e Al-Deen (Branches of the religion):
  <l>        1. Salat (Prayers): In Islam, there are five prayers that each
            muslim must perform each day.
  <l>        2. Sawm (Fasting): Each year, muslims fast the month of Ramadan.
            Fasting begins from dawn to dusk. 
  <l>        3. Alms (Zakat).
  <l>        4. The One-Fifth Tax (Khums):
   <l>       5. Haj (Pilgrimage): Every muslim must visit Macca, at least
            once in his/her life, to perform certain practices.
  <l>        6. Jihad (Holy war): Which is a must on every able male muslim
            in case of defending his Islamic country.
 <l>         7. Al-Amr Bil'ma'aroof (Advising other people): Every muslim has
            the obligation to advise and teach other muslims if he/she
            see something wrong is done.
  <l>        8. Al-Nahi An Al-Monkar (Preventing Evil): Every muslim has the
            duty to prevent other muslims from committing sins and evil
            deeds.
    <l>      9. Al-Ta'wali Li Aw'liya'a Allay (Loving the Infaliables):
            Loving the Infaliables means admitting their leadership to
            all humans, and they are the only viable source that can
            interpret the Holy Qor'an.
 <l>        10. Al-Ta'bari Min A'ada'a Allah (Avoiding and hating GOD's
            enemies).
