<h>Veterinary Assistants and Nonfarm Animal Caretakers
      <h>Significant Points

     <l>* People who love animals get satisfaction in this occupation, but
     the work can be unpleasant and physically and emotionally
     demanding.
     <l>* Most animal caretakers are trained on the job, but advancement
     depends on experience and/or formal training.
     <l>* Job outlook is generally good; however, competition will be keen
     for animal caretaker jobs in zoos.
     <h>* Nature of the Work

     <p>Many people like animals. But, as pet owners can attest, taking
     care of them is hard work. Animal caretakers, sometimes called
     animal attendants or animal keepers, feed, water, groom, bathe, and
     exercise animals and clean, disinfect, and repair their cages. They
     also play with the animals, provide companionship, and observe
     behavioral changes that could indicate illness or injury.
     <p>Kennels, animal shelters, animal hospitals and clinics, stables,
     laboratories, aquariums, and zoological parks all house animals and
     employ caretakers. Job titles and duties vary by employment
     setting.
     <p>Kennel staff usually care for small companion animals like dogs and
     cats while their owners are working or traveling out of town.
     Beginning attendants perform basic tasks, such as cleaning cages
     and dog runs, filling food and water dishes, and exercising
     animals. Experienced attendants may provide basic animal health
     care, bathe and groom animals, and clean their ears. Caretakers who
     work in kennels also sell pet food and supplies, assist in
     obedience training, help with breeding, or prepare animals for
     shipping.
     <p>Animal caretakers who specialize in grooming, or maintaining a
     pet's--usually a dog's or cat's--appearance are called groomers.
     Some groomers work in kennels and others operate their own grooming
     business. Groomers answer telephones, schedule appointments,
     discuss with clients how they want their pets to look, and collect
     information on the pet's disposition and veterinarian. Grooming the
     pet involves several steps: An initial brush-out is followed by a
     first clipping of hair or fur using electric clippers, combs, and
     grooming shears; the groomer then cuts the nails, cleans the ears,
     bathes, and blow-dries the animal, and ends with a final clipping
     and styling.
     <p>Animal caretakers in animal shelters perform a variety of duties
     and work with a wide variety of animals. In addition to attending
     to the basic needs of the animals, caretakers must also keep
     records of the animals received and discharged and any tests or
     treatments done. Some vaccinate newly admitted animals under the
     direction of a veterinarian, and euthanize (put to death) seriously
     ill, severely injured, or unwanted animals. Caretakers in animal
     shelters also interact with the public, answering telephone
     inquiries, screening applicants for animal adoption, or educating
     visitors on neutering and other animal health issues.
     <p>Workers in stables saddle and unsaddle horses, give them rubdowns,
     and walk them through a cool-off after a ride. They also feed,
     groom, and exercise the horses, clean out stalls and replenish
     bedding, polish saddles, clean and organize the tack (harness,
     saddle, and bridle) room, and store supplies and feed. Experienced
     staff may help train horses.
     <p>Animal caretakers in animal hospitals or clinics are called
     veterinary assistants. Veterinarians rely on caretakers to keep a
     constant eye on the condition of animals under their charge.
     Caretakers watch as animals recover from surgery, check whether
     dressings are still on correctly, observe the animals' overall
     attitude, and notify a doctor if anything seems out of the
     ordinary. While among the animals, caretakers clean constantly to
     maintain sanitary conditions in the hospital.
     <p>Laboratory animal caretakers work in research facilities and assist
     with the care of a wide variety of animals, including mice, rats,
     sheep, pigs, cattle, dogs, cats, monkeys, birds, fish, and frogs.
     They feed and water the animals, clean cages and change bedding,
     and examine the animals for signs of illness, disease, or injury.
     They may administer medications orally or topically according to
     instructions, prepare samples for laboratory examination, sterilize
     laboratory equipment, and record information regarding genealogy,
     diet, weight, medications, and food intake. They work with
     scientists, physicians, veterinarians, and laboratory technicians.
     <p>In zoos, caretakers called keepers prepare the diets and clean the
     enclosures of animals, and sometimes assist in raising their wards.
     They watch for any signs of illness or injury, monitor eating
     patterns or any changes in behavior, and record their observations.
     Keepers also may answer questions and assure that the visiting
     public behaves responsibly toward the exhibited animals. Depending
     on the zoo, keepers may be assigned to work with a broad group of
     animals such as mammals, birds, or reptiles, or they may work with
     a limited collection of animals such as primates, large cats, or
     small mammals.
     <h>* Working Conditions

     <p>People who love animals get satisfaction from working with and
     helping animals. However, some of the work may be unpleasant and
     physically and emotionally demanding. Caretakers have to clean
     animal cages and lift, hold, or restrain animals, risking exposure
     to bites or scratches. Their work often involves kneeling,
     crawling, repeated bending, and lifting heavy supplies like bales
     of hay or bags of feed. Animal caretakers must take precautions
     when treating animals with germicides or insecticides. The work
     setting can be noisy. Animal caretakers who witness abused animals
     or assist in the euthanizing of unwanted, aged, or hopelessly
     injured animals may experience emotional stress.
     <p>Caretakers may work outdoors in all kinds of weather. Hours are
     irregular. Animals have to be fed every day, so caretakers must
     work weekend and holiday shifts. In some animal hospitals, research
     facilities, and animal shelters an attendant is on duty 24 hours a
     day, which means night shifts. Most full-time caretakers work about
     40 hours a week; some work 50 hours a week or more. Caretakers of
     show and sports animals travel to competitions.
     <h>* Employment

     <p>Animal caretakers held about 163,000 jobs in 1996. About 33,000 of
     the total worked as veterinary assistants in veterinary services.
     The remainder worked primarily in boarding kennels, but also in
     animal shelters, stables, grooming shops, zoos, and local, State,
     and Federal agencies. In 1996, 2 out of every 10 caretakers was
     self-employed, and 4 in 10 worked part time.
     <h>* Training, Other Qualifications, and Advancement

     <p>Most animal caretakers are trained on the job. Employers generally
     prefer to hire people with some experience with animals. Some
     training programs are available for specific types of animal
     caretakers, but formal training is usually not necessary for
     entry-level positions.
     <p>Most pet groomers learn their trade by completing an informal
     apprenticeship, usually lasting 6 to 10 weeks, under the guidance
     of an experienced groomer. Prospective groomers may also attend one
     of the 50 State-licensed grooming schools throughout the country,
     with programs varying in length from 4 to 18 weeks. The National
     Dog Groomers Association of America certifies groomers who pass a
     written and practical skills examination. Beginning groomers often
     start by taking on one duty, such as bathing and drying the pet.
     They eventually assume responsibility for the entire grooming
     process, from the initial brush-out to the final clipping. Groomers
     who work in large retail establishments or kennels may, with
     experience, move into supervisory or managerial positions.
     Experienced groomers often choose to open their own shops.
     <p>Beginning animal caretakers in kennels learn on the job, and
     usually start by cleaning cages and feeding and watering animals.
     Kennel caretakers may be promoted to kennel supervisor, assistant
     manager, and manager, and those with enough capital and experience
     may open up their own kennels. The American Boarding Kennels
     Association (ABKA) offers a 3-stage, home-study program for
     individuals interested in pet care. The first two study programs
     address basic and advanced principles of animal care, while the
     third program focuses on in-depth animal care and good business
     procedures. Those who complete the third program and pass oral and
     written examinations administered by the ABKA become Certified
     Kennel Operators (CKO).
     <p>There are no formal educational requirements for animal caretakers
     in veterinary facilities. They are trained on the job, usually
     under the guidance of a veterinarian or veterinary technician. They
     start by performing tasks related to basic animal health care, such
     as keeping cages and examination areas sanitary. They also help
     veterinarians prepare for surgery, sterilize surgical equipment,
     observe recovering animals, and give medications and basic medical
     treatment under the directions of a veterinarian or veterinary
     technician. Highly motivated veterinary assistants may become
     veterinary technicians, with additional training from one of
     approximately 65 accredited veterinary technology programs.
     <h>Employers of entry-level laboratory animal caretakers generally
     require a high school diploma or General Educational Development
     (GED) test. A few colleges and vocational schools offer programs in
     laboratory animal science which provide training for technician
     positions, but such training is not strictly necessary. New animal
     caretakers working in laboratories begin by providing basic care to
     laboratory animals. With additional training and experience, they
     may advance to more technical positions in laboratory animal care,
     such as research assistant, mid-level technician, or senior-level
     technologist. The American Association for Laboratory Animal
     Science (AALAS) offers certification for three levels of technician
     competence. Those who wish to become certified as Assistant
     Laboratory Animal Technicians (ALAT) must satisfy education and
     experience requirements before taking an examination administered
     by AALAS.
     <p>Some zoological parks may require their caretakers to have a
     bachelor's degree in biology, animal science, or a related field.
     Most require experience with animals, preferably as a volunteer or
     paid keeper in a zoo. Zoo keepers may advance to senior keeper,
     assistant head keeper, head keeper, and assistant curator, but few
     openings occur, especially for the higher-level positions.
     <p>Animal caretakers in animal shelters are not required to have any
     specialized training, but training programs and workshops are
     increasingly available through the Humane Society of the United
     States and the National Animal Control Association. Workshop topics
     include cruelty investigations, appropriate methods of euthanasia
     for shelter animals, and techniques for preventing problems with
     wildlife. With experience and additional training, caretakers in
     animal shelters may become an adoption coordinator, animal control
     officer, emergency rescue driver, assistant shelter manager, or
     shelter director.
     <h>* Job Outlook

     <p>Employment opportunities for animal caretakers generally are
     expected to be good. The outlook for caretakers in zoos, however,
     is not favorable; jobseekers will face keen competition because of
     expected slow growth in zoo capacity, low turnover, and the fact
     that the occupation attracts many candidates.
     <p>Employment is expected to grow faster than the average for all
     occupations through the year 2006. The growth of the pet
     population, which drives employment of animal caretakers in
     kennels, grooming shops, animal shelters, and veterinary clinics
     and hospitals, is expected to slow. Nevertheless, pets remain
     popular and pet owners--including a large number of baby boomers
     whose disposable income is expected to increase as they age--may
     increasingly take advantage of grooming services, daily and
     overnight boarding services, and veterinary services, spurring
     employment growth for animal caretakers and veterinary assistants.
     Demand for animal caretakers in animal shelters is expected to
     remain steady. Communities are increasingly recognizing the
     connection between animal abuse and abuse toward humans, and should
     continue to commit funds to animal shelters, many of which are
     working hand-in-hand with social service agencies and law
     enforcement teams.
     <p>Despite growth in demand for animal caretakers, the overwhelming
     majority of jobs will result from the need to replace workers
     leaving the field. Many animal caretaker jobs that require little
     or no training have work schedules which tend to be flexible;
     therefore, it is ideal for people seeking their first job and for
     students and others looking for temporary or part-time work.
     Because turnover is quite high, largely due to the hard physical
     labor, the overall availability of jobs should be very good. Much
     of the work of animal caretakers is seasonal, particularly during
     vacation periods.
     <h>* Earnings

     <p>Animal caretakers who worked full time earned a median weekly
     salary of $290 in 1996. The middle 50 percent earned between $220
     and $380. The bottom 10 percent earned less than $170; the top 10
     percent earned more than $500 a week. According to a salary survey
     by the National Animal Control Association, nonsupervisory animal
     caretakers working in animal care and control agencies earned a
     yearly average of about $17,100 in 1996.
     <h>* Related Occupations

     <p>Others who work extensively with animals include animal breeders,
     animal trainers, livestock farm workers, ranchers, veterinarians,
     veterinary technicians and technologists, and wildlife biologists
     and zoologists.
