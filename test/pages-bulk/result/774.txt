<h>Unicorn Print Server: Product Overview

<h>Contents


<h>Introduction

   <p>Unicorn Print Server is an advanced output management solution
   designed to provide an efficient integration of the various types of
   hardware platforms, operating systems and printing devices on a basis
   of a single concept.

   <p>Unicorn Print Server is designed to make the enterprise printing more
   efficient, flexible and reliable. The utilization of printing
   resources, as well as overall printing environment administration and
   maintenance costs can be optimized. The need for the various
   additional platform-specific printing software components may be
   significantly reduced.

   <p>Unicorn Print Server has a scalable architecture. No matter how big is
   the printing environment, the appropriate server configuration can be
   provided. The printing solution can be easily upgraded, while the
   printing environment grows and the need to support additional hosts,
   printers and applications arises. Unicorn Print Server is optimized
   for mission-critical applications, providing an adequate performance
   for large enterprises. On the other hand, for smaller enterprises, the
   money-saving low-end solutions may be provided.

   <p>Unicorn Print Server is optimized to create customer-specific
   solutions. For every particular customer, the special solution can be
   created from the selected set of standard server components.
   Components may be configured to meet customer needs. When some
   customer requirements can not be satisfied using the existing modules,
   additional customer-specific components can be developed and easily
   integrated using the server open architecture. This can dramatically
   reduce time and costs for the development of highly customized
   printing solutions.

   <p>Unicorn Print Server is running on (Windows NT/2000) platform. Most of
   client platforms and printing devices are supported.

<h>Features

   <p>Unicorn Print Server supports the rich set of features. These features
   are grouped into following categories:
     * <l>Spool management
     * <l>Job management
     * <l>Advanced features
     * <l>Optional features

   <p>The following sections contain more detailed discussion of these
   features.

<h>Spool management

   <p>Spool management features provide the basic functionality of the print
   server. These features include:
     * <l>Spooling
     * <l>Job attribute handling
     * <l>Logical and physical printers
     * <l>Printer pooling and load balancing
     * <l>Printer status monitoring
     * <l>Intelligent job scheduling
     * <l>Optimized performance for mission-critical applications
     * <l>Centralized management of the distributed printing environment

   <p>At the very basic level, Unicorn Print Server is a spooling system.
   Its main function is to deliver a document to a specified output
   device on behalf of a client. The client submits the document to the
   print server along with the set of desired output parameters. For each
   incoming print request the server creates a separate print job. All
   parameters of the print request are stored as job attributes. Various
   attributes describe all relevant information about the print job, such
   as job identification, job scheduling, printer selection, current job
   status and document production instructions.

   <p>The print server supports the concept of logical and physical
   printers. Logical printers represent input queues of the print server.
   When a print request is submitted, the name of a logical printer
   should be specified. Physical printers correspond to output devices
   controlled by the print server. Each physical printer represents
   either a physical output device or an external document processing
   software component (e.g., archiving or mailing software).

   <p>The flexible way is provided to establish and manage associations
   between logical and physical printers. Various types of associations
   are possible. For instance, one logical printer may be associated with
   several physical printers, thus forming a printer pool. For each job
   requesting that logical printer the print server selects an associated
   physical printer most suitable to render this job. On the other hand,
   a group of logical printers may be associated with the same physical
   printer. In this case, a separate set of initial attribute values is
   usually attached to each logical printer in a group, and jobs
   submitted to different logical printers may receive different
   attribute values.

   <p>Printer pooling provides additional efficiency and flexibility of the
   enterprise printing process. Using the printer pooling mechanism, such
   important feature as load balancing is implemented. When many print
   jobs are submitted to a printer pool, the print server tries to
   distribute them between printers to provide the balanced load and thus
   optimize the performance. On the other hand, when a job with the
   certain requirements is submitted to a printer pool, the server will
   select the printer that is capable to satisfy these requirements. For
   instance, a particular document may require certain paper media to be
   properly rendered. The server will select a printer that has all
   requested media available. Thus, all jobs submitted to the printer
   pool will be automatically routed to various printers depending on job
   requirements and printer capabilities. Printer pooling can also
   increase the stability of the printing environment. If any printers
   that belong to the printer pool are temporary unavailable due to the
   hardware fault or to the servicing needs, jobs will be automatically
   directed to the printers that are still in operation. The operator of
   the print server may reconfigure printer pools dynamically. If
   necessary, additional printers can be included in printer pools.

   <p>The print server performs monitoring of the status of printers
   attached to the system. The current state (e.g., idle, printing,
   shutdown) of each printer is continuously checked, thus improving the
   performance and reliability of the printing process.

   <p>The print server performs an intelligent job scheduling. The order in
   which jobs are printed depends on many factors. Each job has the
   certain submission time and may have the certain priority assigned.
   Basically, jobs are scheduled according to their priorities and
   submission time. However, it is possible to assign the special held
   state to a job. In this case the job is not scheduled for printing
   until it is manually released. It is also possible to assign the
   certain printing time to a job. The job is held until this time is
   coming, then the job is automatically released. Finally, jobs that
   belong to a certain group may be assigned the same label. These jobs
   will be not printed until any of the target physical printers will be
   assigned the same label. This feature allows the dynamic control over
   the scheduling jobs that belong to different groups.

   <p>After the job is successfully printed, it is retained during the
   certain period of time. The job retention period may vary for
   different job categories, more important jobs may be retained for
   longer time. Retained jobs may be reprinted on demand. When the job
   retention period is expired, the document spool file is deleted to
   free the disk space, but the job entry may be kept for some more time
   to enable accounting.

   <p>The print server performance is optimized to obtain the maximum
   throughput for the mission-critical applications. Normally, thousands
   print jobs can be processed by the server within one hour, given the
   sufficient performance of the printing devices.

   <p>All components of the printing environment can be controlled from the
   single central point. The graphical user interface is provided that
   allows the print server operator to view and modify attributes of any
   object that is managed by the server (e.g., print job, document,
   physical or logical printer). If necessary, the graphical user
   interface may be used from the remote workstation.

<h>Job management

   <p>Job management features are designed to provide control over
   processing of each particular print job. These features include:
     * <l>Common job control functions
     * <l>Job reprint, printer rerouting and range printing
     * <l>Analysis of the document contents for print requirements
     * <l>Advanced support for printer-specific features
     * <l>Support for banner and trailer pages

   <p>The print server implements a set of common job control functions.
   Using the graphical user interface, the operator can hold a job or
   release a job that is currently held. If necessary, processing of any
   job may be cancelled. Document production instructions, like copy
   count, single-sided or double-sided printing, default medium or
   default input tray, collating, finishing and color specifications may
   be changed as well.

   <p>Print jobs that had been successfully printed are usually retained
   during the certain period of time. If necessary, the operator may
   reprint any retained job. Some job attributes may be changed before
   reprinting. The destination printer may be changed, thus providing the
   way for printer rerouting. If necessary, only some selected pages of
   the document may be reprinted.

   <p>The print server is capable to analyze the document contents and
   assign certain attributes to the corresponding job based on the
   results of such analysis. For instance, PostScript documents that are
   conforming to Document Structuring Conventions (DSC) are scanned for
   DSC comments that contain document requirements. These requirements
   are extracted and assigned to the print job as various job attributes.
   The print server also supports analysis of job tickets. Job ticket is
   a sequence of text lines that describe print job requirements. Usually
   the job ticket is inserted by the client application in front of the
   document contents. The print server is capable to analyze job tickets
   and extract these requirements. Since different vendors use different
   formats for job tickets, the flexible method is provided to describe
   such formats and to make them known to the server. Several widely used
   formats (e.g., Xerox Job Tickets) are recognized by the standard
   configuration. The print server also defines a native job ticket
   format, Unicorn Job Tickets. In more general case, the document
   requirements may be contained inside the body of the document. These
   requirements may be extracted and assigned to the job as job
   attributes using the generic context analysis engine. The flexible
   method to define customer-specific context rules is provided by the
   server.

   <p>The print server provides an advanced support for printer-specific
   features. Generally, the print server handles all document production
   instructions in the device-independent way as job attributes. When the
   document is about to be transmitted to the printer, printer-specific
   instructions are generated and inserted into the output stream in the
   way that depends on the given printer type. The print server may use
   various methods to implement printer-specific features. For PostScript
   printers, the PostScript code based on Adobe PostScript Printer
   Description (PPD) files is generated. For some printer types
   vendor-specific job tickets are created and inserted in front of the
   document contents.

   <p>Support for printer-specific features offers solutions for several
   types of output management problems that often appear in the various
   environments. For instance, when print jobs are submitted by typical
   Windows applications, printer drivers generate the printer-specific
   code that implements requested features. Once the print job is
   created, it is not possible to reroute it to a printer of a different
   type, because the new printer may interpret incorrectly that
   printer-specific code. Another problem occurs in traditional mainframe
   environments, when spooling systems running on the mainframe hosts are
   not aware about the advanced features supported by the printing
   devices and therefore are not capable to use these features for
   rendering documents generated by the host applications. Both problems
   can be effectively addressed by Unicorn Print Server support for
   printer-specific features.

   <p>The print server is designed to support printers of various vendors.
   The flexible way is provided to define specific details of the
   communication protocol, as well as device capabilities for every
   particular printer type.

   <p>The print server can automatically produce banner and trailer pages
   that may be printed before and after the document. Banner and trailer
   pages are composed dynamically, based on the defined sets of
   templates. Values of the various job attributes that identify the job
   or specify the job characteristics may be inserted into banner and
   trailer pages. Templates may be customized to match the specific
   needs.

<h>Advanced features

   <p>Advanced features are designed to enable the creation of powerful
   enterprise output management solutions. These features include:
     * <l>Remote and distributed printing
     * <l>Rearrangement of the document contents
     * <l>Integration of external format converters
     * <l>Accounting
     * <l>Built-in scripting engine

   <p>When the printing environment of an enterprise is distributed through
   several geographical locations, additional problems arise. When a
   document is transmitted to a printing device that is installed at the
   remote geographical location, data may be lost or corrupted. The print
   operators working at both transmitting and receiving locations need
   adequate means to track all remotely printed jobs and to control the
   status of such jobs in the reliable way. To solve these problems, the
   print server provides facilities specially designed for the remote and
   distributed printing. At each remote location a separate instance of a
   print server may be installed. Thus the network of print servers
   operating together is created. When a print server installed at any
   location needs to print a job to any remote printer, it does not
   attempt to transmit the job to this printer directly. Instead, the job
   is first transmitted to the corresponding remote print server, which
   takes care of the actual job delivery. In this case the job may be
   tracked by both submitting and receiving print servers. This method
   enforces the transparent, controllable and reliable remote document
   transfer and printing.

   <p>Some applications may require rearrangement of information contained
   in source documents, before printing. For instance, many banking
   packages generate source documents that contain information related to
   multiple bank customers, and it is desired to fetch information
   related to each particular customer from the source set of documents,
   in order to form one set of output documents for each customer. The
   print server provides components that support the document contents
   rearrangement.

   <p>Basically, the print server itself has a limited built-in support for
   various document formats. Currently it is capable to analyze and use
   certain elements of PostScript documents. Optional components are
   designed to support some additional formats (e.g., Xerox VIPP). In all
   other cases the print server relies either on the ability of a
   printing device to interpret the particular document format or on the
   availability of the third party format conversion software. When the
   printing device supports the requested document format, the document
   is simply transferred to that device. Otherwise the external third
   party software component that converts the document format to one
   supported by the target printer is required. External converters may
   be integrated into the print server environment in the flexible and
   efficient way. If the target printer does not support the given
   document format, the server selects the suitable external converter
   and automatically launches it to perform the conversion. When the
   conversion is finished, the resulting document is returned to the
   print server for the final output.

   <p>The accounting feature is designed to produce reports that contain
   statistical information describing the volume printed and printing
   resources consumed during the given period of time, grouped by users
   and/or specially defined accounting profiles. Using this feature,
   printing costs related to each user group can be calculated. The
   overall efficiency of the enterprise printing process and of the
   utilization of printing resources can be estimated as well.

   <p>Unicorn Print Server is designed as the open, extensible software. The
   extensibility mechanism is based on the scripting technology. The
   print server includes simple yet powerful embedded scripting language
   that provides access to all objects of the server object model, like
   print jobs, documents, logical and physical printers, thus enforcing
   the open architecture of the server. The scripting language is based
   on Tcl (tool command language). Most of the existing print server
   components can be customized using scripts. Scripting may be also used
   for the efficient creation of entirely new print server components
   that implement custom features not available otherwise.

<h>Optional features

   <p>Optional features are designed to enable the efficient integration of
   the print server with certain vendor-specific platforms and
   technologies. Currently these features include:
     * <l>Advanced support for Xerox VIPP technology
     * <l>Client software for Open VMS
     * <l>Client software for Microsoft Windows

   <p>The print server provides an extensive support for Xerox VIPP
   technology that may be used for traditional host printing and legacy
   document formats. The print server performs all VIPP formatting and
   resource management, based on the document requirements and printer
   capabilities.

   <p>For VIPP documents, the print server can perform effectively the
   resource management. All available resources (e.g., fonts, forms and
   images) may be stored in the print server database in the centralized
   way. The server performs the analysis of the document and extracts
   resource requirements. Depending on these requirements and the printer
   capabilities, resources needed to render each particular job are
   included into the output stream and transmitted to the target printer.

   <p>The enhanced support is available for print clients running under Open
   VMS. Open VMS native document formats and job submission methods are
   supported, providing seamless integration into the standard operating
   system environment.

   <p>The enhanced client software is available for Microsoft Windows. This
   software acts as an integral part of the standard Windows spooling
   system. Once installed, the Windows client software automatically
   becomes available for all applications running on a client system. The
   Windows client software allows a user submitting a print job to
   specify values of required job attributes in the device-independent
   form, instead of setting the various printer-specific features
   requested by each printer driver. These attribute values are
   transmitted to the print server, which is completely responsible for
   their interpretation depending on the type of the target printer. The
   client software for Windows can dramatically reduce number of various
   printer drivers installed on each client system, thus reducing the
   maintenance cost of the distributed printing environment.
