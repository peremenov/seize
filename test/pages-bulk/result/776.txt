   <h>Zoned Heating and Cooling Systems 

   <p>From the first blast of winter through the dog days of summer, it is a
   domestic power struggle more fierce than the competition for the
   television remote control. When one thermostat controls the
   temperature for an entire house, it produces predictable results that
   pit husband against wife and basement playroom against upstairs office
   in "The Battle of the Thermostat".

   <p>The war begins when dad turns the thermostat down because
   the family room is too warm. A few minutes later mom turns up the
   thermostat because the bedroom is too cold. Eventually, someone is
   opening a window or closing a vent to get the temperature just right,
   and no one is really comfortable. But there's a better solution than
   family feuds or dressing in layers.

   <p>Zoned heating and cooling systems allow you to control the temperature
   of each room individually. By using a series of motorized dampers and
   thermostats that work independently, zoning can eliminate hot or cold
   rooms found in almost every home, while cutting energy by up to 25
   percent, according to Anne Drake, a spokeswoman for Honeywell's zone
   control systems.
   <p>"People like to save energy, but they don't like to sacrifice
       comfort," said Drake. "Energy savings used to be the key thing in
       people's minds when it came to air conditioning and heating, now
       comfort is also a major consideration. When you sit down and
       explain to people what zoning does from a cost efficiency
       standpoint, you are basically them comfort in their home."

   <p>Simple laws of physics illustrate why it is
   virtually impossible to keep an entire house at a consistent
   temperature without zoning. Warm air rises while cold air sinks,
   leaving upstairs rooms six to ten degrees warmer and basements six to
   ten degrees cooler than ground level rooms. A single thermostat keeps
   the temperature balanced in the room where it is located, but can't
   tell if the temperature has changed in other rooms of the house.
   Zoning helps maintain a consistent temperature throughout the house by
   providing different levels of air distribution to different areas of
   the home.

   <p>Zone controlled systems divide a home into areas with common heating
   and cooling needs during specific parts of the day. Air flow is
   controlled in each area by a separate thermostat. Instead of sending
   the same amount of heated or cooled air into all room every time the
   furnace or air conditioner is turned on, the system sends conditioned
   air only to the zones that need it. Temperaturs can be kept at an
   ideal comfort level when the family is up and about, then changed to
   an energy-saving temperature overnight or when the family is away.

   <p>For example, in a typical two-story house, the main floor with the
   living room, kitchen and dining area, is usually occupied during the
   evenings. Bedrooms are occupied mostly at night and in the early
   morning. With zoning, you can cool or heat one area of the house at a
   time. You can also select different temperature settings for each zone
   of the house. In most homes, a two or three zone system is sufficient.
   Rarely does a home equire more than three zones.

   <p>Most homes can be zoned according to room occupancy, but unique
   exposure factors may require a different zoning strategy. A room with
   large amounts of glass facing south or west will have more heat gain
   than other rooms in the home. A separate zone might be required for
   that room alone!

   <p>At an average price of $1,200, zone control systems provide a cost
   efficient alternative to dual air systems that require separate air
   conditioners and furnaces for different areas of the house, according
   to Ron Reinhardt of Research Products Corporation. "It justs makes
   sense. You become more comfortable in your home, and you save money."

   <p>Zone control is especially effective in homes that have multiple
   levels, spawling designs, large glass windows, or large open areas
   such as an atrium or solarium. Existing homes with finished basements,
   attic spaces and additions are also good candidates for zoning. Almost
   all forced air systems can be converted for zone control, according to
   Reinhardt. "A control panel, thermostats, dampers and the proper duct
   work are all it takes."

   <p>Builders are still learning about zone control systems, even though
   HVAC contractors have been installing them for the last five years or
   more. Zoning is still be introduced in some regions of the United
   States and has been well received by the home-buying public.
   <p>"Almost every time I sat down to write contract with a home buyer, the
       first thing they wanted added to their home was zone heating and
       air conditioning," said Dennis Belk, a division manager for Dobson
       Builders in Greenville, South Carolina. Dobson has made zoned
       controlled heating and air a standard feature in homes priced over
       $120,000.

  <p> While still in it's infancy, zoning is to heating and cooling what the
   light switch is to lighting. Virtually all homes come equipped with
   more than one light switch, and one day soon, homes may come with more
   than one thermostat.
