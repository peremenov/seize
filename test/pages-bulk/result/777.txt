   <h>Giving Thanks!
   <h>Copyright 2003 Amanda Bennett -- All Rights Reserved

   <p>This is the time of year that the warm weather is waning, you begin to
   notice the smell of burning leaves and ripening apples. The clear cool
   breeze is on your face first thing in the morning, and the children
   have new energy and interest in the season. Autumn is here and isn't
   it beautiful? A time for harvesting, canning, preserving and getting
   stocked up for winter -- and the perfect time for reflecting on the
   many things for which we should be thankful.
   <p>I number among these: God, our family, our home, our love
   and our great country. We have indeed been blessed in this country, as
   were our forefathers and the early celebrants of that first
   Thanksgiving in America -- both the Pilgrims and the Indians that
   shared the meal and celebration together. At our house, we use this
   time of gratitude and counting our blessings to study that first
   Thanksgiving as an integral part of our homeschool studies.
   <p>As with any unit study topic, I try to pick out all of the
   important subtopics, crossing the curriculum spectrum many times. For
   example, when studying Thanksgiving, there is plenty of historical
   information to examine, along with geography (ocean crossings,
   continents, climates), science (plant varieties, growth, propagation,
   some of the sicknesses of the time, animal life in the region), art
   (N.C. Wyeth's paintings, clothing of the time, crafts), and reading
   (both fiction and nonfiction books).
   <p>When I first began preparing a unit study on Thanksgiving,
   I had the incorrect notion that my understanding of that period of
   American history was fairly complete. I was certainly proven wrong as
   we progressed through our study! I had not realized the extent of the
   sacrifice made by the Pilgrims over that 13 year period, traveling to
   Holland for years, and then finally returning to England to take part
   in the colonization of America. I never really knew or understood the
   origin of the "King James" version of the Bible and how it was
   connected to the Separatists.
   <p>Each year, we focus on different aspects of the event.
   This year, we will take a look at what was involved in their survival
   in a new land -- when we started making our list of what we would do
   if we were the Pilgrims, my son chimed in "find a Walmart!" The
   reality of being in the middle of nowhere to maintain your religious
   beliefs, giving up what was so familiar and comfortable to go to an
   unknown destiny was pretty amazing to them. This was exactly the
   concept that I wanted them to understand -- that sacrifices are
   oftentimes made for what you believe in, and to trust in the Lord to
   lead and protect you.
   <p>As we work our way through this study, we have many, many
   activities and studies that we enjoy. For example, a popular question
   has been over the difference in Indian corn and table corn, as we know
   it. This opens the door to an opportunity to help them learn more
   about the differences in plant varieties and about the gardening
   practices of both the Pilgrims and the Indians.
   <p>Not only are we looking at some of their survival
   gardening, we are also trying to get a better understanding of what
   types of shelter they built, what kinds of sickness they had to deal
   with and why we don't have those illnesses today. There are many
   aspects of their daily living that we can't easily relate to from our
   own experience, and it is important for the children to "see" what
   life was like then, the tools they used, the things they did without,
   the responsibilities of each family member, and the importance of
   their faith and trust in God to provide for their needs.
   <p>One of the books that opened my eyes to a broader view of
   the politics and history of the Pilgrims' journeys was Saga of the
   Pilgrims: From Europe to the New World, by John Harris (published by
   Globe Pequot Press). This book, written for the seventh grade and up,
   is very interesting reading and certainly presented a new perspective
   on these religious outcasts. I recommend that both parents and the
   older children read this one -- it is a very informative and
   interesting book to share and discuss. For the younger children, a
   comparable book might be If You Sailed on the Mayflower in 1620, by
   Ann McGovern (published by Scholastic).
   <p>As we study the Pilgrims and the people involved in this
   "new beginning", the characters of the people and some of the flavor
   of their hopes and dreams, ideas, work ethic, and humor come to light,
   and are appreciated by those involved in the study. When their first
   winter is reflected upon, one can't help but feel the loss of so many
   loved ones on a personal level.
   <p>The resourcefulness and foresight of these religious
   outcasts helped lay some secure and strong foundations for our
   country. When they took the time and painstaking effort to write and
   bring to acceptance the Mayflower Compact, they unknowingly developed
   the long-lasting concept of freedoms and rights that we Americans
   enjoy and expect. People tend to develop a much deeper appreciation of
   these freedoms when they get some hands-on exposure to just exactly
   what prices have been paid to obtain and protect those freedoms, and
   it is my goal that this study will help the children develop a solid
   understanding and appreciation of these principles and ideals.
   <p>As you begin a unit study about Thanksgiving, try to
   include as many interesting books and activities as possible. Consider
   writing to the living history museum, Plimoth Plantation, for
   additional materials and ideas. Their address is Plimoth Plantation,
   Public Relations Department, P.O. Box 1620, Plymouth, MA 02360. If you
   cannot visit Plimoth Plantation in person (some of us live a bit FAR
   to do that!), there is a video that many libraries carry titled:
   "Plimoth Plantation: A Visit", produced by VideoTours in their History
   Collection.

   <p>Enjoy this season of giving thanks and bringing the harvest home.
   There is so much to be thankful for, and as homeschoolers, we have
   even more to be thankful for -- the chance to really know our children
   and walk the walk with them, sharing and caring and motivating and
   learning beside them. Enjoy the adventure, and may you and your family
   be abundantly blessed!
