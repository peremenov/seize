                   <h>Pompidou Group Ministerial Conference

                           <h>Dublin 16 October 2003

                    <h>Statement by Mr. Antonio Maria Costa
                             Executive Director

                       <h>Drug Control Policy in Europe:
                   Innovative Responses to New Challenges

   <p>Dear Ministers,
   <p>Friends and Colleagues,

   <p>I would like to thank the Pompidou Group for the invitation to this
   Ministerial Conference. I also wish to express my appreciation to the
   Irish Government for hosting the meeting.

   <p>The Pompidou Group is at the forefront of the fight against illicit
   drugs. It is a forum for co-operation and information exchange
   especially important to my Office: we have collaborated on various
   projects and always found this partnership quite productive.

   <p>Today I should like to share with you the United Nations Office on
   Drugs and Crime's latest analysis of the illicit drug situation,
   especially in Europe. I shall frame my statement keeping in mind three
   of the most frequently asked questions in our business:

     <p>(i) Over 200 million people have consumed drugs in the past 12
     months. Illicit drug trafficking over the same period has once
     again dwarfed the resources at our collective disposal to fight it.
     Are these numbers so enormous as to make us despair?

     <p>(ii) New drugs, some designed by mad lab scientists and evil
     genetic engineers, are threatening the health of our societies. Do
     we have in place adequately targeted policies, able to complement
     law enforcement with effective prevention and treatment?

     <p>(iii) Contemporary cultural trends are weakening traditional
     sources of education and values, especially for the young. Can drug
     control succeed by counting only and exclusively on
     counter-narcotic measures? Namely, can it succeed without society
     strengthening its psychological and ethical barriers against
     substance abuse?

   <p>As you can predict, my answer is a triple no. I will use three
   metaphors to explain why.

   <p>First , the question of the adequacy of the resources, given the
   gigantic drug addiction and trafficking problems we face. I shall use
   an IT-based metaphor. In this time and age of large-scale computing
   needs, the past approach to problem-solving, centred on the
   development of larger and larger mainframe computers, has failed.
   Modern IT engineering is no longer based on gigantic IBM-type Cyber
   machines, almost as large as this hall. Thanks to the power of
   partnership, an adequate number of small PCs -- working together --
   can cope with any realistic-size computing problem. In other words,
   size is not an issue any longer: what counts is mutual support. Are we
   all, around this table, contributing to the partnership needed for
   effective drug control? I am deeply convinced that if -- and only if
   -- we develop the right kind of partnership, we need not be afraid of
   the hundreds of billions of euros mobilized by drug traffickers.

   <p>Second , I am sure you share my Office's major concern regarding the
   spreading abuse of cannabis and, especially, of synthetic drugs
   (amphetamine type stimulants, ATS). Some of you have devised
   innovative responses to these new challenges. Yet, these responses
   will be effective if -- and only if -- we all find a way to fight for
   the common purpose, with due respect to national cultures and
   individual comparative advantage. If you allow me another metaphor, we
   should play like an orchestra, with every instrument contributing to
   the overall polyphony.

   <p>Unfortunately, today's drug-control concert -- which should be based
   on a score unanimously agreed with the general ratification of the
   drug control Conventions -- well, today's concert is rather
   cacophonous.

   <p>Some countries, even though they have ratified the Conventions, have a
   relatively tolerant approach to the abuse of cannabis, even of
   ecstasy. Other countries have put in place anti-drug programmes
   focussed on law enforcement and not balanced with prevention and
   treatment. Again, other countries keep changing policy, on the basis
   of the political cycle rather than of a comprehensive and long-term
   vision. If we intend to progress in this common endeavour, then the
   concert must become more pleasing to the ears and our musical
   instruments better tuned.

   <p>The third question concerns the importance of looking at the overall
   picture - namely at the systemic changes in our societies. There is
   something more to drug policy than drug control. We are facing a tide
   of socio-cultural changes (my final metaphor). A rising water level
   indeed lifts all boats, including the drug boat. But the impact of
   changing sea level can be controlled -- just as the Dutch did, London
   also did and the Venetians will soon do.

   <p>Are we sure that nothing can be done about waning family values, about
   the growing assertiveness of individual rights irrespective of public
   interest, or about our kids' Saturday-night rave to master the
   universe at the risk of ecstasy dependence, psychosis and early
   Alzheimer-type symptoms? I believe that if -- and only if -- we are
   willing to recognize these trends as problematic, and we are similarly
   willing to do something about them, will the drug control measures
   envisaged in the Conventions be effective.

   <p>To conclude on all this, I believe that, because:

     <p>(i) our partnership is not always strong;

     <p>(ii) the (drug control) music we play is not always harmonious,

     <p>(iii) of weakened socio-cultural protection against drug abuse,

   <p>because of all these factors, your work is more difficult. These
   factors limit effective use of the resources taxpayers put at the
   disposal of drug control. These factors confuse public opinion and
   favour the spreading of (at times deliberately) erroneous views about
   the harm caused by illicit drugs or about the success of policy. In
   short, these factors make it easier for the pro-drug lobby to
   proselytise in their effort to weaken, even abolish the drug-control
   Conventions.
   
   <h>Global trends and Europe
   
   <p>For most countries drug trends -- production, trafficking, addiction
   and health consequences -- can be estimated with a certain accuracy,
   and I welcome the Pompidou Group's emphasis on evidence-based
   policies.

   <p>According to our latest information, efforts to control the
   cultivation of organic drugs (coca and opium) continue to register
   significant progress. For example, opium production in the Golden
   Triangle (Myanmar, Laos and Thailand) is foreseeably coming to an end,
   closing a very tragic, century-long chapter in drug production. In
   essence, drug cultivation is now localized in two countries
   (Afghanistan and Colombia) that have been devastated -- and this is
   not a coincidence -- by terrorism and organized crime. It may take a
   generation to solve these countries' problems, as was the case for
   Thailand, Pakistan, Iran and Turkey (for opium), Bolivia and Peru (for
   coca).

   <p>The trends in the abuse of cocaine and heroin vary. Addiction is
   stable or generally decreasing in North America and Western Europe,
   where the age of addicts is increasing (30 - 45 on average). On the
   other hand, abuse is spreading in Eastern Europe, CIS and Asia
   (China). All considered, it seems that abuse of heroin in particular,
   is a disease of industrially advanced societies, later replaced by
   other substance abuse (ATS).

   <p>The problem of cannabis is different. Its cultivation is widespread
   enough, and spreading further, including to some very affluent
   countries in Europe and North America despite their obligations under
   the drug Conventions. Demand is also increasing, facilitated by
   recreational abuse, to which some governments turn a blind eye.

   <p>Synthetic drugs are another new threat, also involving rich countries
   in Europe. Production and trafficking are increasing -- as reported in
   the first UNODC Global Survey on Ecstasy and Amphetamines presented
   last month. World production is about 500 tons per year (a volume
   equivalent to that of heroin), worth about 65 billion dollars, and
   generating extraordinary profits (up to 3000%).

   <p>In Europe like anywhere else, designer drug tablets are a grave
   threat, especially to young people. They find the tablets more
   practical than syringes and needles, and more in tune with today's
   pharmacology that helps to deal with frustrations and inhibitions
   anytime, anywhere: at the workplace, in the club, or in the bedroom.
   One more pill in the family's pill-box is not seen as abuse, but
   rather as a socially sanctioned behaviour. Put more generally, it
   looks as if in Europe designer drugs are the next narcotic infection,
   chronologically following heroin.

   <p>Should we be alarmed? Yes, because the harm caused by synthetic drugs
   is serious and cumulative. Although often abused in a leisure setting,
   these drugs are not like cocktail drinks. Abuse is rather a Russian
   roulette: when the bullet is fired, it makes a hole in the brain.
   Science has ascertained that amphetamines cause dependence and
   psychosis; ecstasy damages the brain and accelerates its normal ageing
   process. In general, the abuse of synthetic drugs is having an impact
   on society, with today's young people risking premature Alzheimer-type
   symptoms.

   <h>Facing the challenge in Europe

   <p>I am especially concerned because some countries in Europe maintain a
   fatalistic approach, even benign neglect to drug abuse in general, and
   to the consumption of cannabis and ATS in particular. Some families,
   many educators and a great many MTV entertainers consider drug abuse
   to be an exhilarating part of growing up.

   <p>This attitude has stretched, among others, to the testing of pills in
   discos to guarantee that the poison being ingested -- for example,
   MDMA, the main ingredient of ecstasy -- is indeed the one of choice.
   Since you care for your youth's health, I propose a different method
   to discover what goes on: test the kids as they leave a rave party.
   Test them as is done for alcohol to prevent drunken driving: you will
   see the Saturday-night road massacres decline.

   <p>Above all, our collective responsibility to reduce the suffering
   caused by drugs -- and the underlying costs -- needs to keep in mind
   the broader picture. Drug abuse is spreading because it is riding
   life-style and fashion trends that are communicated, advertised and
   shared almost instantly, worldwide.
     * <p>Cultural trends are making abuse of cannabis and of synthetic
       drugs more acceptable. We need to strengthen the institutions that
       provide young people with the information necessary to resist the
       peer pressure to consume drugs. Today the young who do not share
       the drugs taken by friends are made to feel like inferior beings:
       let's help these kids feel good about themselves.
     * <p>Many of the current anti-drug campaigns are not successful because
       they provide only rhetoric messages. We need to disseminate
       scientific information on the harm caused by drugs (especially
       cannabis and ATS).
     * <p>Countries party to the UN Conventions confirmed their current
       validity at a Ministerial Meeting last April in Vienna (I
       recognize many of you who were present at that meeting). I invite
       countries to practice what they preach, and maintain cohesion of
       intent within the plurality of interventions.
     * <p>Everywhere in the world, the large majority of people (over 90%,
       that is) do not use illicit drugs. It is necessary to mobilize
       this silent majority in the anti-drug campaign, help them create a
       socio-cultural environment (especially within the family) that
       does not favour substance addiction.

   <p>To conclude on this subject, I call on you all to challenge simplistic
   and counter-productive recipes, such as suggesting that society
   surrender unconditionally to drugs, by making them legal. Let us graft
   freedom from drugs onto the tree of individual liberty and collective
   right.

   <h>The pro-drug lobby has become part of the drug problem

   <p>Wherever I go, to meet with representatives of the pro-drug lobby to
   understand their reasons and discuss their proposals. Our openness to
   this dialogue is total and without inhibitions -- obviously starting
   from the assumption that the UN Conventions are and remain law until
   governments decide to change them.

   <p>However, it should be clear that:
     * <p>those who advocate individual freedom in drug abuse, in a manner
       inconsistent with the common good,
     * <p>those who propose legalization to reduce crime, forgetting that
       there are even worse types of criminal exploitation (of women,
       children, gamblers, not to talk about tobacco and alcohol),
     * <p>those venture capitalists, who propose legalization of drugs,
       betting that hashish will replace tobacco as the next cash-cow,

   <p>well, all these people, trying to justify the unjustifiable, end up
   accepting the unacceptable. Namely they gamble on our society's
   health. These people are becoming part of the drug problem.

   <p>Arrogantly, the lobby has divided all of you between the progressives
   and the troglodytes, namely between those who agree with them and
   those who do not (including my humble self). This is confusing public
   opinion -- maybe this is the objective. The spreading of the (false)
   notion that some drugs are soft, namely not so dangerous and
   soon-to-be legal, causes drug addiction to increase. Look at the
   following sample-based correlations:

     <p>(i) In countries where the pro-drug lobby is more active (and the
     anti-UN Conventions rhetoric is stronger), opinion polls show that
     young people perceive ecstasy and cannabis as not quite so harmful
     and their possession OK.

     <p>(ii) The perception by young people of the relative un-harmfulness
     of drugs is correlated with higher drug abuse;

     <p>(iii) Polls also show that, when people perceive that drugs are OK
     with the law , they abuse drugs even more.

     <p>(iv) Finally, and as a consequence of all the above, statistics
     show that when people perceive drugs as widely abused , they abuse
     drugs even more.

   <p>Some people point to the greater harm caused by licit substances, as a
   justification to liberalize drug abuse. Statistical evidence indeed
   confirms that tobacco kills twice as many as alcohol worldwide, and
   that alcohol kills many times more than illicit drugs. But please, do
   not compare apples to oranges: tobacco and alcohol are legal and are
   consumed massively, while illicit drugs are illegal and their
   availability is indeed reduced by the controls in place. Abuse would
   obviously increase if drugs were legalized, although it is impossible
   to predict by how much. Yet, the correlations mentioned earlier --
   especially the one between drug availability and drug consumption --
   are convincing enough to fear a major increase of drug abuse as a
   consequence of drug liberalization. In other words, the preferential
   option should be for safety over pleasure.

   <p>The analogy between drug and tobacco abuse could be further
   elaborated. The international community is well aware of the harm
   caused by tobacco (and alcohol) and it is doing something as evidenced
   by the recent WHO convention on tobacco control. Why are the new,
   strict sanctions against tobacco successful? Not because of police
   measures, but because non-smokers exert irresistible moral and social
   pressure on smokers to refrain. And why are smoking rates declining in
   the countries committed to stop it? Because of the major court cases
   against tobacco's merchants of death; because of the severe financial
   penalties; because of the sky-rocketing health insurance premiums; and
   because of the massive public awareness campaigns. All these measures
   have pushed the tobacco business in some countries close to
   bankruptcy, and have put smokers on the defensive.

   <p>It is necessary to do the same for illicit drugs. Instead, and despite
   the controlled nature of the drug business, no European country that I
   know has engaged in similarly tough measures against cannabis.
   Ironically, cannabis contains many of tobacco's carcinogenic
   components, plus 400 odd cannabinoids - among them the dangerous THC.

   <p>The silent majority that abuses no drugs and pays the bill of
   addiction control should mobilize to contain drug abuse just as it is
   doing for tobacco. Without the participation of civil society it is
   not possible to reach sustainable results in any area, particularly in
   controlling drug abuse.

   <p>In the next two days, you will discuss the new challenges for drug
   policy in Europe. I am confident that your wisdom and sense of
   responsibility will guide you to find a common approach and identify
   innovative responses. I hope my statement will help you in your
   deliberations.

   <p>Thank you for your attention.

                                                  <h>Dublin, 16 October 2003
