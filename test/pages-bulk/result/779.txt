   by state law toward the cost (premium) of each insurance eligible
   employee's basic health and life coverage, in accordance with Texas
   Insurance Code, Chapter 1551, Texas Employees Group Benefits Act, as
   amended, (House Bill No 2, Seventy-second Legislature of Texas, 1991)
   and the rules and regulations under the Uniform Group Insurance

   the event of any discrepancy between the policy and provisions stated

   <h>3. Responsibility: 

   <p>The University Human Resources Department is responsible for
   coordinating the participation of insurance eligible employees in the
   Uniform Group Insurance Program and TexFlex that are administered by
   the Employees Retirement System of Texas. The University Human
   Resources Department and ERS are responsible for the administration of
   the Long Term Care Plans.

   <h>4. Programs: 

   <p>The following programs are available on an optional basis:
   (For specific information regarding plan options, coverage schedules,
   and premium rates, consult with the Benefits section of Human
   Resources.)

     <p>4.1 Group Comprehensive Medical: Insurance-eligible employees may
     elect to cover themselves and their dependents in HealthSelect of
     Texas or, if available, an approved health maintenance organization
     (HMO). These programs provide for comprehensive medical benefits
     for hospital services, physician's or surgeon's services, nursing
     care, x-ray, and laboratory exams, and other medical expense
     benefits for employees and eligible dependents. Insurance eligible
     regular faculty and staff are required to be covered by the
     employee only basic health plan (HealthSelect of Texas), unless
     coverage is waived or another option is chosen.

     <p>4.2 Basic Term Life and Accidental Death and Dismemberment (AD&D):
     Employees who participate in the basic health plan or in an HMO are
     also provided with $5,000 basic term life insurance and $5,000
     basic AD&D coverage.

     <p>4.3 Optional Coverages: Upon enrollment in the Uniform Group
     Insurance Program basic health plan (either HealthSelect or an
     HMO), employees may during their initial period of eligibility
     (first 31 days of employment) enroll in any of the following
     optional coverages:

     <p>4.3.1 Optional Term Life With AD&D Life: Coverage (for the
     employee) is available in an amount equal to one (1) or two (2)
     times the employee's basic annual salary rounded to the next higher
     multiple of $1,000 without evidence of insurability. Coverage equal
     to three (3) or four (4) times annual salary is available only
     after satisfying evidence of insurability. The maximum amount of
     Optional Term Life Insurance may not exceed $400,000.

     <p>4.3.2 Voluntary Accidental Death and Dismemberment (AD&D) Plan:
     Voluntary accidental death and dismemberment coverage is available
     for the employee and/or eligible dependents in an amount of $10,000
     to $200,000 in increments of $5,000. (See current schedule of
     benefits for amounts available to employees over 70.)

     <p>4.3.3 Dependent Term Life: Group term life insurance equal to
     $5,000 with $5,000 AD&D is available to cover eligible dependents.

     <p>4.3.4 Disability Insurance: Eligible employees may elect to
     participate in short term disability, long term disability or both
     short and long term disability coverage. (See current schedule of
     benefits for details of coverage.)

     <p>4.3.5 Dental Coverage: Eligible employees may elect coverage for
     themselves and eligible dependents in either a dental indemnity
     plan or in a dental maintenance plan. The dental indemnity plan
     allows the participant freedom to select care from any dentist
     while the dental maintenance plan offers benefits with specific
     providers. (See schedules of benefits for details.)

     <p>4.3.6 Premium Conversion: Premium conversion enables employees to
     pay for out-of-pocket premiums for health, dental, life, and AD&D,
     with tax-free dollars. Premium conversion for dependent life
     coverage is not allowed by IRS regulations. Disability premiums are
     also not tax-deferred to allow for tax-free benefits.

     <p>4.4 TexFlex Programs: Participants in the Uniform Group Insurance
     Program may participate in the flexible benefits program called
     TexFlex. TexFlex allows employees to pay for eligible health care
     and day care expenses with tax-free dollars. The following programs
     are available: (Detailed information regarding TexFlex is available
     in the Human Resources Department.)

     <p>4.4.1 Health Care Reimbursement Account: A Health Care
     Reimbursement Account (HCRA) enables employees to set aside
     tax-free dollars to cover eligible health care expenses incurred by
     the employee and eligible dependents.

     <p>4.4.2 Dependent Care Reimbursement Account: A Dependent Care
     Reimbursement Account (DCRA) enables employees to pay for dependent
     care expenses for children under age 13 or for elderly or disabled
     dependents with tax-free dollars.

     <p>4.5 Long Term Care Insurance: All insurance-eligible employees may
     enroll in group long term care insurance coverage for themselves
     and their spouses without evidence of insurability during the
     employee's initial 31 days of employment.

   <h>5. Enrollment Eligibility - Health and Basic Life:

     <p>5.1 A new full-time insurance-eligible faculty or staff member is
     required to be covered by the "employee only" basic health and term
     life plan the first of the month following their initial ninety
     (90) day waiting period unless coverage is waived, except for new
     faculty and staff hired on September 1, 2003. New faculty and staff
     hired on or before September 1, 2003, will be eligible for coverage
     effective September 1 without an initial 90-day waiting period. The
     University will provide the employer contribution from local
     (non-appropriated funds) for those hired on September 1 to the
     first of the month following their initial ninety (90) day waiting
     period. New insurance-eligible faculty and staff members hired
     after September 1, 2003 will be subject to the ninety (90) day
     waiting period.

     <p>5.2 A new part-time insurance eligible employee beginning September
     1, 2003 or later will automatically have coverage waived. The
     employee will have an initial eligibility period to enroll in basic
     health and term life coverage. The intial eligibility period will
     begin on the employees hire date and will last until the first of
     the month following a 90-day waiting period.

     <p>5.3 New insurance-eligible employees have an "initial period of
     eligibility". The eligibility period begins on their first active
     duty date and ends on their health coverage date (ninety plus
     days). During this initial eligibility period, employees may enroll
     eligible dependents without evidence of insurability. Thereafter,
     evidence of insurability will be required, and coverage is never
     guaranteed. Additional restrictions on enrollment may be imposed by
     the Employees Retirement System (ERS) and because of the tax break
     provided through premium conversion.

     <p>5.4 Newly acquired dependents (through marriage, birth, or
     adoption) may be enrolled without evidence of insurability within
     31 days of becoming eligible.

     <p>5.5 After dropping coverage, evidence of insurability must be
     provided by an employee, retiree, or dependent to re-enroll.

     <p>5.6 Full-time employees (working 40 hours a week) will receive a
     state contribution of 100 percent of the cost of the employee basic
     health and term life coverage, and 50 percent of the cost of
     dependent coverage. Part-time employees (working 20 or more hours a
     week up to less than 40 hours a week) will receive a state
     contribution of 50 percent of the cost of the employee basic health
     and term life coverage, and 25 percent of the cost of dependent
     coverage. Insurance eligible, part-time graduate students are
     eligible to receive an additional employer contribution from local
     funds of the University up to the full cost of the employee basic
     health and term life coverage, and 50 percent of the dependent
     coverage.

     <p>5.7 For new insurance eligible faculty and staff members who start
     employment on September 1, 2003 the University will provide the
     employer contribution from local (non-appropriated) funds for the
     months from their hire date, September 1, 2003, to the first of the
     month following ninety (90) days of employment.

   <h>6. Enrollment Eligibility - Optional Coverage and TexFlex: 

   <p>New insurance-eligible employees may enroll in Optional Life,
   Dependent Life, Disability, and Dental optional coverage and TexFlex
   within thirty-one (31) days of employment. Thereafter, application for
   coverage may be made only with evidence of insurability. ERS
   administrative rules restrict application with evidence of
   insurability for these coverages to the annual Summer Enrollment
   Period unless an eligible Qualifying Life Event has occurred.
   Voluntary AD&D does not require evidence of insurability, but election
   of Voluntary AD&D after an employee's first thirty-one (31) days is
   limited to the Summer Enrollment period unless an eligible Qualifying
   Life Event occurs.

   <p>Application with evidence of insurability for the University's Long
   Term Care insurance may be made at any time during the plan year.
   Employees may apply for ERS's Long Term Care program during summer
   enrollment. Employees may enroll in dental coverage during their
   initial 31 days of eligibility or during the annual Summer Enrollment
   period.

   <h>7. Making changes to Insurance or Tex Flex coverage: 

   <p>Outside of the employee's first 31 days of employment, coverage
   changes can only be made during the annual Summer Enrollment period.
   If an employee has an eligible Qualifying Life Event as defined by
   ERS, the employee may be able to make certain changes during the plan
   year, provided the applicable form is completed in Human Resources
   within 31 days of the event.

   <h>8. Employment for Less than Twelve (12) Months/Leaves of Absence: 

   <p>All individuals employed less than 12 months are expected to arrange
   advance payments for all insurance programs with the Human Resources
   Department for the summer months. Employees who are on leave of
   absence, or who are not on the payroll for any month, are required to
   make advance payment.

   <p>Employees on approved leave without pay can maintain UGIP coverage for
   a maximum period of 12 continuous calendar months for any reason. An
   additional 12 months (for a total of 24 months) may be allowed for
   those on Leave Without Pay for educational purposes as certified by
   the institution. Employees who are on leave without pay, except for
   the purpose of Family and Medical Leave without pay, are not eligible
   to receive the state insurance contribution.

   <p>Individuals employed prior to 9/1/01 with nine-month appointments may
   elect to receive their nine-month salary over a period of 12 months by
   electing the 9/12 Pay Option on the Payroll Options form prior to
   August 31 of any fiscal year thereby ensuring that premiums are
   deducted during the summer months.

   <p>Individuals with nine month appointments must assure payment of summer
   insurance premiums. These employees must elect to receive their nine
   month salary over a period of 12 months by electing the 9/12 Pay
   Option, or pre-pay summer insurance premiums by electing the 12 over 9
   Premium Reserve Option. If 9/12/ pay is not elected, Premium Reserve
   enrollment is mandatory.

   <h>9. Insurance Programs for Reservists/Employees Called to Active Duty: 

   <p>Reservists/employees called to active duty may continue insurance
   coverage during their military leave of absence without pay for up to
   12 months. See Extended Military Leave Policy No. 1.4.9. (Disability
   insurance is suspended while on leave of absence without pay.)
   Reservists/Employees are not eligible to receive the monthly state
   insurance contribution while on leave when the leave encompasses the
   month. To continue coverage the reservist/employee must pay the total
   monthly premium.

     <p>9.1 Reservists/Employees called to active duty may drop coverage on
     themselves and/or their dependents while on leave of absence. The
     reservist/employee may reinstate all insurance coverages that were
     in effect immediately prior to the commencement of the active duty
     without evidence of insurability and/or pre-existing conditions or
     limitations, provided the reservist/employee returns to work within
     90 days of discharge and reinstates coverages within 30 days from
     the date the reservist/employee returns to work.

     <p>9.2 Covered dependents of the Reservists/Employees who drop
     coverage while on a leave of absence may apply for continuation of
     coverage for up to 12 months under the provisions of COBRA.
     Dependent coverage may be reinstated as indicated in 8.1. when the
     reservist/employee returns to work.

   <h>10. Insurance Programs for Retirees: 

   <p>Upon retirement from the University, a regular faculty or staff member
   may be eligible to continue membership in the Uniform Group Insurance
   Program (UGIP) for Retirees. Eligible retirees may enroll in health,
   basic life, optional life, dependent life, and dental coverage by
   completing the appropriate TRS/ORP Retiree Enrollment Form within 31
   days of retirement eligibility. To be eligible for retiree insurance
   an individual must be at least 65 years of age and have a minimum of
   ten years of creditable service with the Teacher Retirement System
   (TRS) or equivalent service in the Texas Optional Retirement Program
   (ORP) or qualify for retirement benefits based on age plus years of
   service totaling 80 or more, and must be eligible to receive a
   retirement annuity from either TRS or ORP. In addition, a minimum
   number of years of UGIP participation is required: 3 years if hired
   before September 1, 2001 or 10 years if hired September 1, 2001 or
   later. Retirees may continue dependent life and optional life coverage
   within limits established by the Employees Retirement System.

     <p>10.1 Once enrolled in the retiree insurance program, the retiree's
     coverage is administered by the Employees Retirement System of
     Texas.

     <p>10.2 The State of Texas contributes each month toward the cost
     (premium) of each regular retired faculty or staff member's group
     medical insurance program. The amount is set by state law.

     <p>10.3 Employees who become disabled may be eligible for continued
     coverage in accordance with the rules and regulations of the
     Employees Retirement System of Texas.

   <h>11. Insurance Coverage Continuation:

     <p>11.1 A surviving spouse and/or dependents who are covered by the
     group at the time of the death of a retiree or an employee who
     meets the eligibility criteria for retiree insurance may, at their
     option, continue such coverage indefinitely, subject to continued
     payment of group premiums for the surviving spouse and/or
     dependents. Upon leaving the group, the spouse and/or dependents
     have the right to convert to an individual policy without evidence
     of insurability, if applied for within 31 days of termination of
     group status.

     <p>11.2 Under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act
     (COBRA) of 1986 the University offers a continuation option for
     certain employees and their dependents whose coverage under the
     group medical plan program would otherwise end. This continuation
     option is available to persons whose coverage would end on or after
     October 1, 1986.

     <p>11.2.1 Employees and/or their dependents may elect an 18-month
     continuation if terminating employment (except for gross
     misconduct) or if reducing the number of hours worked would result
     in a loss of coverage.

     <p>11.2.2 For the purposes of continuation of coverage under COBRA,
     gross misconduct is defined as, but not limited to, the following:

     <l>a. Theft, misappropriation of unauthorized use of University funds
     or property.

     <l>b. Carrying firearms or other dangerous weapons on University
     premises.

     <l>c. Assault of a University employee or student.

     <l>d. Conviction of a felony or conviction of a misdemeanor involving
     moral turpitude.

     <l>e. Sexual harassment.

     <l>f. Bringing liquor, marijuana, or narcotics onto the University
     campus; or consuming liquor or using marijuana or narcotics on
     University premises.

     <p>11.2.3 Dependents may elect a 36-month continuation if:

     <l>a. Coverage would otherwise end because of the death or divorce or
     legal separation from the covered employee;

     <l>b. A dependent child would lose coverage due to plan provisions
     (for example, reaching a maximum age or due to marriage); or

     <l>c. If coverage would end due to the employee reaching Medicare
     eligibility.

   <p>11.3 In the case of 10.1 or 10.2 the surviving spouse or dependents of
   COBRA continuations are not eligible for premium sharing
   contributions.
