   <h>Background
   <p>On the 9th to 12th September 2003, the Excel conference centre hosts
   Europe's largest arms fair, the Defences Systems & Equipment
   International arms fair (DSEi)
   <p>Nearly 1,000 arms companies congregate in London's Docklands to flog
   off lethal arms, bombs and other weapons to buyers from all over the
   world.
   <p>Some of these weapons will be supplied to some of the worst regions of
   conflict in the world. In the past, countries invited in the arms fair
   have included some with the worst records of human rights violations:
   Indonesia (1999), Colombia (2001) and Saudi Arabia (three times
   running).
   <p>By inviting human rights abusing states to DSEI, our government is
   giving these countries the moral and political support they need to
   buy arms.
   <p>The event takes place behind security fences and police lines. The
   public are not invited.
   <p>But the protesters still came!
   

   <h>The security around the Arms Fair was huge
   <h>Protesting at the DSEI death dealers' fair
   <p>Today protestors again converged on the DSEI death dealers' fair for a
   full day of actions against the terrorists and suppliers of terrorists
   exhibiting their twisted wares there.
   <p>Arriving at about 11.30 at Canning Town Underground/DLR station, where
   according to the DSEI and Wombles websites those attempting to
   blockade the "fair" were to meet from 11, our small group of
   anarchists (from various parts of the UK) had a rendez-vous with other
   small groups and decided to try to get to the Excel Centre itself as
   it appeared no large crowd was forthcoming.
   <p>(Our first encounter with police was immediately on stepping outside
   the station, where we were instantly hassled by 3 officers who accused
   us of being "stoned").
   <p>There were a number of affinity groups, comprising perhaps 50-60
   people, in addition to a pink-clad samba band, scattered around the
   Excel centre, but due to large police presence and lack of numbers on
   our side the nearest anyone was able to get was either across the
   railway or the dock from the fortress.
   <p>After walking around through a small housing estate to get to the
   opposite side of the dock (from where we could get a good view of the
   huge, grey battleships anchored alongside the centre, and were
   approached and photographed by river police in their speedboat), we
   found the footbridge blocked and so returned to the appropriately
   named Freemasons Road where the samba band were.
   <p>One policeman threatened me with arrest if I did not remove my mask
   after I walked over to see why another protestor was being hassled - 5
   minutes later, after I had put my mask back on, the same officer
   walked past me unheeding. However, a marker pen was confiscated from
   us on the accusation that it "could be used for criminal damage".

   <h>Undercover 'suit' gets escorted away!
   <p>As nothing was really being achieved, we wandered fairly aimlessly
   around until about 2.30pm, managing to shout at a few delegates but
   (at least myself) feeling rather disappointed at the absence of a
   large crowd at the Excel centre.
   <p>Around 2.30 we were informed that Reclaim the Streets were starting a
   street party at the nearby Rathbone Street marketplace (in Canning
   Town) and so we headed down there, however there was a heavy police
   presence and small knots of protestors and of police stood around for
   a while, some police attempting to make conversation with protestors
   in a lame attempt to gather information (and one admitting that "I am
   a pawn"!)
   <p>At about 3.30 we were told, by an unknown source, that RTS were no
   longer meeting at the marketplace but would send a messenger to tell
   us where they would actually hold the party.
   <p>Nothing seemed forthcoming for a while but suddenly at about 4.30
   people began moving and we followed, soon joined by more protestors
   including several cyclists (who were apparently the remains of the
   Critical Mass bike ride that morning) and a fantastic sound system,
   built from offcuts of wood and covered in colourful peace flags, on
   the back of one bike.
   <p>We headed down the A13 with police following on both sides of us. At
   this point the Met showed their extreme stupidity - as we approached a
   McShit atthe side of the road, every single policeman ran like fuck
   through our lines to stand around the "restaurant" with batons raised,
   much to our amusement as the approximately 200-strong group of
   anarchists marched straight past!

   <h>Heavy handed policing
   <p>The sound system and march/street party made its way up the A13
   bypass, successfully reclaiming the street from oil-addicted traffic,
   with police fairly unsuccessfully trying to hold us back at several
   points.
   <p>However the police somewhat managed to get their act together at a
   junction and after an attempt to break police lines which was repelled
   by numbers the party turned back along the same road. Some scuffles
   occurred when people broke through roadworks fences and overturned
   some of them, with a fence being thrown back at some anarchists.
   <p>We continued down the street for a while before reinforcements of
   police arrived (the cowards clearly seeking safety in ludicrously
   unnecessary numbers) attempted to pen us in in a short section of the
   road, and so we sat down there for about an hour while the sound
   system pumped out some fantastic dub tunes to which there was much
   dancing and merriment in stark contrast to the tight-lipped,
   misery-faced cops.
   <p>Apparently, for no reason the cops started shoving people along again
   until we were between a park, in which more police on horses were
   congregating, and a housing street.
   <p>At this point the police decided we were to be herded into the park
   and started physically dragging people through the gate. Many of us
   sat down and refused to move, but due to a lack of a universally
   agreed decision either to stay where we were or go into the park we
   were unfortunately all dragged into the park.
   <p>However, the police were in for a shock as local teenagers, entirely
   independently of the DSEI protests, started throwing stones and bricks
   of them, which forced a retreat of the police into the park with us,
   while others attempted to disperse the locals.
   <p>One local teenager said to us "The police do nothing when our houses
   are burgled or there is violence in our area, they don't even come
   when we call them, but when people try to have their say hundreds of
   the fuckers invade us!" - fucking class!
   top 

   <h>The police were in an arrestin' kinda mood...
   <p>Despite the police's promise to "allow us to disperse once we were in
   the park", a section 44 was slapped on us and we were held for over an
   hour before eventually being allowed to leave in groups of 4 (several
   people were illegally videoed and forced to remove their hands from
   over their faces, but thankfully no-one was searched, despite them
   taking an agonisingly long time between each group of 4 they allowed
   out).
   <p>There were several instances of police violence in removing people
   from the road, including one man with physical disabilities who was
   bodily picked up and thrown into the park, and one Met police medic(!)
   who was so vicious in attacking protestors with his baton that he
   actually had to be held back by 2 City of London police!
   <p>Separated from the rest of the protest by the dispersal tactics, we
   drifted back towards Canning Town station and the market place,
   attempting to find our mates who had been separated from us.
   On the way, while slightly lost in a housing estate, 2 of us witnessed
   a large but peaceful looking man, clearly a protestor, being chased
   down the road by 3 police officers, brutally slammed up against a wall
   and handcuffed.
   <p>We tried to ask what he was being arrested for and one of the
   policeman claimed "assault", but the protestor denied having assaulted
   anyone. I managed to get 2 of the 3 officers' badge numbers, so say hi
   to the cameras Met police nos. XP91 and BS510...

   <h>Protesters about to break through the lines
   <p>Having phoned our mates and found out they were in a pub called "The
   Ordnance Arms", we attempted to meet them there, only to be told by
   the landlady that she didn't want any more protestors in her pub
   because "there were already too many".
   <p>On leaving and phoning our mates from a nearby phone box, we found
   that they had been locked in the pub, apparently on the instructions
   of a police FIT team. However after an altercation between locals also
   locked in the pub and the landlady, they were allowed out and we
   walked to West Ham station to get a train to another pub and go home.
   <p>In addition to what we personally witnessed, we were informed by
   telephone and text message of several other actions including the
   Docklands Light Railway being blockaded at least twice, by protestors
   lying down on the tracks or D-locking themselves to trains, which were
   probably the most directly effective actions of the day.
   <p>We also received an unconfirmed report of a truck exploding in the
   nearby Blackwall Tunnel, which the police were "treating as
   suspicious"... no idea whether this was the case, or who did it if it
   was terrorism, but we did see a large plume of smoke. However other
   sources also told us this was a smoke bomb.

   <p>Overall the day was enjoyable, but in real terms of arguable merit.
   <p>While as a spontaneous statement, celebration and show of resistance
   against authority the RTS action was successful (and certainly made us
   feel good while we were there, unlike the pigs who blatantly all
   wanted to go home), it of course did not disrupt the arms fair as
   such, and so cannot really be considered a success by narrow "direct
   action" criteria, and the large crowd which the DSEI and Wombles
   websites led us to believe would be ready to storm the Excel centre in
   the morning did not materialise.
   <p>However it was certainly inspiring to see the amount of support showed
   by the local community to the protestors (pedestrian passers-by only
   shouted approval, while drivers of expensive cars were the only ones
   shouting abuse), and to see the amount of witty and creative
   protestors (one of the best being a man in a suit with a briefcase
   full of plastic doll's limbs, saying "Wanna buy some arms?") in
   attendance.
   <p>Actions continue tomorrow (Thursday 11th September) and over the rest
   of the week, keep checking Indymedia, DSEI.org and the various
   supporting groups' websites (linked to from DSEI.org) for details.
