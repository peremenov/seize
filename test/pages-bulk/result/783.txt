   <p>S. 4093, which extends through September 30, 2007, the period of time
   during which certain borrowers remain eligible for Department of
   Agriculture guaranteed operating loans.
   <h>Now, riddle me this
   <p>I have been updating my database for the use of the term "unitary
   executive" by the president for a book that I am working on, and for
   some reason I am getting some inconsistency in the search engine
   results from what has to be the use of the same database.
   <p>First, the database. Normally, I go to the "Weekly Compilation of
   Presidential Documents," which has a great search engine and is
   usually fairly reliable. Problem is that it often is months behind, so
   if you are trying to be as current as possible, it may not be your
   best database.
   <p>The White House webpage can give fairly up to current information, but
   the problem is you don't have a lot of control over the terms you use
   to search. So, my first approach is to search for "unitary executive,"
   which produces 114 results, the most recent of which is the signing
   statement for the "John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for
   FY 2007." But I know from the recent signing statements that I have
   logged, the term "unitary executive" has popped up. So my second
   approach is to search the phrase that is boilerplate for the signing
   statement on the White House webpage: "president's statement on" That
   search yields 401 results and lo and behold the most recent statement,
   the "Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006" has the term I am looking
   for, as does some half dozen or so, all more current than the middle
   of October. Any idea why? Why wouldn't a search for "unitary
   executive" give me the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act? Any answers?

<h>Begging Your Indulgence

   <p>If you will allow me, I wish to speak one more day about the recent
   spate of signing statements issued by President Bush since there have
   been some interesting reactions to one in particular.
   <p>First, to give you a sense of how the rhetorical signing statement
   works (that is, if these are fairly arcane and technical documents,
   how does it mobilize public opinion if it does not get covered in the
   MSM--sort of like the "tree falling in the woods" example.
   <p>In that crazy bill President Bush signed yesterday dealing with a
   number of subjects, including international trade, it appeared in a
   website aimed at the textile industry. This site--Fibre 2 Fashion--ran
   a press release form USTR Susan C. Schwab, applauding President Bush's
   signing of the bill and referencing the signing statement. Thus it
   confirms the notion that the rhetorical signing statement isn't
   directed at mass public opinion, but rather elite opinion since elites
   are more important to the day to day matters of governing. There is
   already good evidence that in the aggregate, we know the president
   will issue more rhetorical signing statements when there is a federal
   election or when his poll numbers are in a state of flux--but that
   doesn't tell us much about the use of the device at the individual
   level. It is a promising area of study that still needs a great deal
   of attention.
   <p>Speaking of the rhetorical presidency--Yesterday I wrote about the
   President using the Indian Treaty Room as a way to reinforce his
   message of maintaining a strong war footing. In today's Washington
   Post, Dana Milbank also remarks on the unusual choice of a room to
   hold a press briefing.
   <p>Next, the signing statement President Bush issued regarding the trade
   of nuclear material to India is taking on some interesting
   characteristics as well as criticisms. Further, it is also quickly
   becoming clear that the challenges in the signing statement may not
   have much to do with separation of powers concerns, or concerns over
   presidential prerogatives, but rather domestic and foreign politics.
   <p>The President, it seems, was taking on heat from India when the bill
   landed on his desk. It seems that India did not much care for the
   intrusion upon Indian sovereignty in a couple of provisions of the
   bill. If you recall from my discussion of the signing statement,
   Sections 103 and 104 were among those the President cited as
   problematic. In Section 103, Congress outlined eight distinct
   declarations of foreign policy regarding the sale of nuclear material
   to India. The Congress were concerned mostly with nuclear material
   winding up in the hands of Iran, and thus mandated "...that presidents
   should report each year on whether India was fully cooperating to
   restrain the Iranian nuclear program." When President Bush signed the
   bill, he treated that demand as "advisory."
   <p>The author of this provision, Senator Tom Harkin (D.IA) has not taken
   lightly to President Bush's signing statement, arguing that it is
   "...outrageous that the President has repeatedly stated the greatest
   threat to U.S. national security is a nuclear Iran, yet explicitly
   rejects Congress declaration that it shall be the official policy of
   the United States that India will not use its nuclear technology to
   help develop Irans nuclear weapons arsenal" and with his signing
   statement has "...once again...shown he views Congress as a nuisance
   rather than an equal branch of government under the Constitution."
   <p>In addition, one part of Section 104 required the Nuclear Suppliers
   Group to sign off on the deal before it becomes binding. The NSG,
   which consists of 45 countries, was formed in 1974 in response to
   India's detonation of a nuclear bomb and is designed to enforce
   non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, in particular by states that are
   considered outlaw or renegade in the international community (like
   Iran). President Bush also treated the NSG action as advisory, which
   has drawn the ire of Congressman Ed Markey (D.MA), who stated: "The
   President is turning decades of U.S. international policy on its
   head--and [is] thumbing his nose at Congress at the same time." Others
   worry that if the NSG refuses to sign off, President Bush will simply
   go forward and ignore the international organization, thus destroying
   an organization dedicated to keeping nuclear weapons out of the hands
   of renegade states as well as undermining US credibility in the World
   on yet another issue.
   <p>But from the President's POV, he was catching a great deal of heat
   from India over what they perceived to be overly hostile language from
   the Congress, and language that does not treat the country as a
   sovereign nation. Leaders in India were "outraged" over the language
   prior to President Bush's signing statement, expressing concerns about
   "...certain extraneous and prescriptive clauses that may limit its
   strategic autonomy and independence of its foreign policy", and even
   after the signing statement, the "Prime Minister...still has some
   concerns." It is clear that from a foreign policy standpoint, the
   United States needs India as a balance to the growing influence of
   China, as well as a logger-head in the region to fight the GWOT.
   <p>So this is continuing to play out, but regardless of how it concludes,
   it gives us a nice insight into some of the pressures that drive a
   signing statement, and that it isn't always just the protection of
   prerogatives despite what the language may say.

<h>Drum Roll Please

   <p>Give it up to the Bush administration. In earnest, as the days of 2006
   are ticking away, President Bush has gotten busy and finally pushed
   his signing statement challenges over the 1100 mark.
   <p>Today, President Bush was busy with his 10:00 am press briefing next
   door in the Indian Treaty Room in the Eisenhower Building, a perfect
   place to project the image of a commander in chief during a time of
   war. It is the same room where the Bretton Woods Treaty and the UN
   Charter were signed, a mere coincidence, I am sure.
   <p>After finishing the press conference (which lasted less than an
   hour--only one question each for those lucky enough to get the call),
   President Bush walked down the hall to Room 450 in the Eisenhower
   Office Building, where he signed a real bastard child of a bill, the
   "Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006." In a ten-minute statement,
   President Bush spelled it out--the bill was about tax reform,
   renewable energy, affordable health insurance, helping farmers, and
   busting open oversea markets. Like I said--a real bastard of a bill
   (there were five different versions of the bill).
   <p>But while it was all smiles across the way from the White House, the
   protectors of prerogatives toiling away inside the White House and
   down the street at the DOJ office produced the non-public signing
   statement--the one that contains the real "meat and potatoes." In it,
   President Bush issued six (at least) signing statements with some
   interesting comments.
   <p>In the second paragraph, he took exception to two provisions that
   ordered him to submit particular recommendations to the Congress,
   which he noted (as he has done many times before) that the
   Constitution gives the power to the president to determine what he
   will or will not recommend. But for good measure, he also tossed in
   that the provision also impinged upon his authority to "supervise the
   unitary executive branch" (his ability to tell which executive branch
   officials to come up with the particular recommendations).
   <p>In the next paragraph--and an interesting one at that--he decides to
   treat as advisory and not mandatory a provision that requires the
   "concurrence of State officials as a precondition to the execution of
   the laws..." Now mind you, President Bush ran as a governor, Reagan
   Republican, and "state's righter," yet here he is qualifying a
   provision that allows a state governor (and this particular provision
   involves western states) a say on how the federal government can lay
   claim to private lands (something that Republicans boiled about during
   the Clinton administration). As such, and to make sure that everyone
   knew he meant it, President Bush writes that he has the authority to
   treat this condition as advisory because of the Constitution's
   "vesting in the President of the executive power and the duty to take
   care that the laws be faithfully executed." Wow. Calling in the big
   guns when you begin to rely on the vesting clause of all things.
   <p>Finally, in the last paragraph, President Bush qualifies a mandate
   that he consult with certain congressional committees whenever he
   monkeys with the Carribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act, among other
   things. This particular provision deals with trade benefits for Haiti.
   Here again, similar to the previous paragraph, President Bush is
   overriding the concerns of certain legislators who are attempting to
   protect businesses in their districts or states from perceived unfair
   trade deals that benefit Haiti ("In General--Haiti shall be eligible
   for preferential treatment under this section if the President
   determines and certifies to Congress that Haiti...").
   <p>I have to credit the administration, though, regarding the publicity
   of the signing statements, giving the press and public ample
   opportunity to keep check. First, Tony Snow tells those reporters in
   attendance that the President is signing bills and then today, on the
   White House website where the signing ceremony information resides,
   the White House has provided a link to the private statement that
   makes all the challenges. So nothing underhanded here (other than
   alluding to a number of objectionable provisions without specifying
   precisely which ones are being singled out--but that is what
   researchers are for).

<h>Statements, Statements, Everywhere...

   <p>More news on the signing statement front. First, if you wish to see
   the rhetorical value of the signing statement, then turn your
   attention to this press release from a private nuclear company
   operating in India, which expects to see a lot of business as a result
   of yesterday's signing of the US-India Nuclear Cooperation Promotion
   Act. The company, Thorium Power, was one of the many in attendance at
   yesterday's signing, something that they were too pleased to tell all
   who would listen:
   <p>Seth Grae, Thorium's Chief Executive Officer, and Ambassador Dennis
   Hays, the company's Vice President and Director of Government
   Relations, joined senior administration officials, members of Congress
   and representatives of the influential Indian-American community as
   President Bush officially opened nuclear trade relations between the
   United States and India. The signing of the agreement will enable
   Thorium Power to pursue opportunities in a country that currently
   boasts the fastest growing nuclear sectors in the world.
   <p>There is a bright side to yesterday's signing statement and signing
   ceremony. It was picked up, in detail, by the press. Trouble is, the
   press that noticed was not domestic but rather based in India. First,
   in the Hindustan Times, the two authors in the byline noted that the
   law was a benefit to India, and also noted, pleasingly, that the parts
   of the act where Congress attempted to limit India's benefit, the
   President stepped in to "allay" India's fears because President Bush
   told Congress he would treat those sections as "advisory."
   <p>And a news site dedicated to "connecting the Telugu community", an
   editorial also finds support in President Bush's signing statement,
   taking a paragraph to explain to the readers what a signing statement
   is and why they are important--or at least how the editorial
   understands their importance:
   <p>US presidents have often used such signing statements to interpret a
   law the way they choose without taking the extreme step of rejecting a
   bill outright with a veto. Usually these are quietly listed in the
   Federal Register recording all executive actions without a public
   announcement.
   <p>Pretty good.
   <p>President Bush also hurriedly announced the signing of a couple more
   bills today. He signed the reauthorization of the "Ryan White CARE
   Act," named for Ryan White, the young boy in 1990 who died of AIDS
   after receiving the disease from infected blood that was transferred
   into him via treatment for hemophilia. The official title of the bill
   is the "Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Modernization Act of 2006" and
   the signing statement was purely rhetorical. It is also important to
   note that incoming-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi also sent along
   her own statement in support of President Bush's signing statement.
   Now let's see if she will make it a practice of attaching her own
   signing statement to bills that are sent to the President. President
   Bush also signed the Combating Autism Act of 2006, which President
   Bush notes that he is "proud to sign this bill into law and [he is]
   confident that it will serve as an important foundation for our
   Nation's efforts to find a cure for autism." To make sure of the
   rhetorical value of these two signings (there was no formal signing
   ceremony), Press Secretary Tony Snow announced the signings at the
   start of his noon press gaggle. By getting zero questions about it, or
   about the duplicitous statements yesterday, I think the administration
   got its answer.
   <p>Finally, to round things off, President Bush signed two other
   bills--again of the rhetorical variety but not mentioned at the
   gaggle: HR 5466: the "Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic
   Trail Designation Act" and S. 3678, the "Pandemic and All-Hazards
   Preparedness Act" which created a new agency--the "Biomedical Advanced
   Research and Development Authority" inside Health and Human Services
   and "authorizes appropriations through 2011 to improve bioterrorism
   and other public health emergency planning and preparedness
   activities."
   <p>What is noteworthy about today's signings? It is the first time since
   President Bush's first term that he issued a string of signing
   statements that did not challenge any provisions of the law. In fact,
   by looking at my data, we have to go all the way back to President
   Bush's first several signing statements, all of which were garden
   variety rhetorical statements.
   <p>Either we are coming full circle or perhaps we are given some insight
   into his New Years resolution?

<h>Whoop D'ere It Is

   <p>Today, with some fanfare, President Bush signed the "Henry Hyde United
   States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act," which will
   actually get tacked to the 110th since Congress is out of session. And
   with this signing, we get to see deception at its finest.
   <p>This particular signing, complete with a "Fact Sheet" and a special
   focus on "Energy," is fairly lengthy and congratulatory, and it is
   exactly what nearly everyone thinks about, or at least they did before
   President Bush, when they heard the term "signing statement."
   <p>There are folks assembled behind the President, and one of the
   outgoing Senate Majority Leader, and most importantly, one action shot
   of President Bush signing the bill. It also goes on for 17 paragraphs,
   is broken up a couple of times by applause, and very importantly
   numbered points for the journalists in attendance, describing the
   "four goals" the administration hopes to achieve after the law takes
   place.
   <p>In the parlance of those of us studying the presidential signing
   statement, this is what we refer to as a rhetorical signing statement,
   which is designed to give the administration maximum coverage, bumping
   off (needed in this case) any bad news for the day (temporarily, of
   course). But this is all smoke and mirrors--kissing babies, and first
   kisses, and all those good things that happen in life.
   <p>A second signing statement--the evil twin of this one--also went into
   effect at roughly the same period that this one was signed. This
   statement has been pruned of the niceties. It was not publicly
   announced. There were no cameras, dignitaries, reporters--nobody. This
   signing statement is only three paragraphs long, but don't let it's
   small size fool you. This one means business.
   <p>In this particular signing statement, the President:
     * <l>Tells Congress that one section* of the bill, where Congress
       thinks it is setting policy, will only be treated as advisory;
     * <l>Treats as advisory a provision** that cuts the President out of
       approving of any nuclear item to India that runs contrary to the
       Nuclear Suppliers Group guidelines;

   <p>President Bush does continue with the frustrating routine of making a
   challenge to several different sections for several different reasons
   without making it clear precisely which section he is challenging and
   why. Thus President Bush writes:
   <p>The executive branch shall construe provisions of the Act that
   mandate, regulate, or prohibit submission of information to the
   Congress, an international organization, or the public, such as
   sections 104, 109, 261, 271, 272, 273, 274, and 275, in a manner
   consistent with the President's constitutional authority to protect
   and control information that could impair foreign relations, national
   security, the deliberative processes of the Executive, or the
   performance of the Executive's constitutional duties.
   <p>Thus all of the attention that the signing received was directed
   precisely where the administration wanted, and away from the sections
   of the bill that the President has undermined, and by looking at
   Google News, it appears it worked.
   <p>For those of you who are counting along with me, here is the numbers
   to date:
   <p>With today's challenges, President Bush has issued a total of 137
   signing statements and has made 1097 separate and distinct challenges
   to the provisions of the laws he has signed. It is clear that we won't
   have the type of signing statement we saw this time last year, but
   President Bush could be noteworthy by issuing one more signing
   statement and breaking over that 1100 mark!
   <p>Here's hoping
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   *<p>Section 103 declares the policy of the US shall be 1) for India and
   Pakistan to stop production of nuclear material that can be used for
   military purpose; 2) to push India into "nonproliferation regimes and
   activities; 3) to push India into arms control agreements; 4) to meet
   certain requirements of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA);
   5) to meet the Guidelines for Nuclear Transfers and other multilateral
   arrangements; 6) to meet with the multilateral Nuclear Suppliers Group
   to restrict the transfers of nuclear materials; 7) to insure
   compliance with the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty; and 8) to make
   sure that any export in nuclear material to India is for non-military
   purposes.

<h>World War III--The War on Christmas

   <p>There are things we can expect to see come the start of the Christmas
   season: There is Rudolph, and Frosty, and the "Miser" brothers; There
   is Christmas advertising pushing closer to Halloween; and there is the
   "War on Christmas."
   <p>In today's edition of "Slate," David Greenberg traces the history
   behind the "War on Christmas." This all stems from the recent flak in
   the Seattle Airport where a Rabbi asked to have an "eight foot tall
   menorah" displayed among the Christmas trees that were on display. The
   airport instead removed the trees, reasoning that if the menorah went
   up, then every other religious group in the country would demand to
   have their religious symbols on display as well (similar reasoning, if
   you recall, to Senator Santorum's argument against gay marriage--you
   know, "if you allow homosexuals to marry, then...man on chicken
   love"). As it ended, the trees came back after the Rabbi was deluged
   by hate mail, death threats, and so on. Christmas saved.
   <p>But without a lot of coverage was the leaders of the pack--Fox News
   and this conjured up "problem" that isn't.
   <p>For instance, here is Bill O'Reilly on December 11:
   <p>...the war on Christmas continues. It's not as bad as last year, but
   it's still around, even if the far left press won't admit it. 
   <p>Which is funny because two nights later, Chief Demagogue John Gibson
   praises the return of the Christmas trees, stating that the trees "are
   now all back up again thanks to the media frenzy that ensued..."
   <p>Last year, the "war on Christmas" was all Fox's was about, thanks in
   part to Gibson's book on the subject and "No Spinning" spinster Bill
   O'Reilly, who then claimed the war was all part of "the secular
   progressive movement" losing attempt to "marginalize Christmas"! And
   for Gibson, when he wasn't blabbering about it on his show (The Big
   Story with John Gibson), he was being interviewed on any number of Fox
   News shows, like this December 21, 2005 appearance on Hannity and
   Company (when did Colmes get bumped from the marquee?) under the
   title: JOHN GIBSON DEFENDS THE VERACITY OF THE SUPPOSED WAR ON
   CHRISTMAS. Gibson took the time to trumpet: "I say we won the war on
   Christmas" where Colmes retorts: "But 'war on Christmas' is a little
   bit exaggerated, isn't it?" and Gibson jabs: "No" and Colmes, in his
   infinite wisdom, responds: "All right." Now I see why he has been
   moved from the marquee.
   <p>Looking over a Lexis search, this "war on Christmas" is a popular news
   item, with the rest of the news universe following Fox's lead. But
   what a bunch of nonsense. Every year, on cue, countless hours of
   television news coupled with precious space on the newspage is wasted
   over a problem that does not exist. Why?
   <p>For conservatives, it has provided a nice break from the beating they
   have taken over the War on Iraq, scandal-rama, and the scarce presence
   of an agenda. For a couple of months, they are able to prove that they
   matter. And the rest of the "secular" media follows right in line.
   Why? When Fox News steps up on the soap box to decry the bogey man,
   imagine what could be accomplished if the remaining media simply
   ignored them?
   <p>But they can't. And they can't for two reasons:
   <p>First, we all know how easy it is for conservatives to cow the
   "mainstream media" into playing along with the "liberal" label.
   Although I don't think this is really it because conservatives--at
   least O'Reilly--will rip them anyhow.
   <p>The second reason, which fits, is this is a heckuva lot easier to
   cover than, say, the United States total intelligence budget, or
   whether the Iraqi study group's plan is workable, or how to save the
   middle class. Also, it is sure to draw viewers or reader, or for talk
   radio, listeners than any of the topics listed above.
   <p>But here we are at one of the many cross-roads moments where the press
   faces the road taken and the road not taken, and once again, the
   beaten path is beaten a little more.
   <p>Thank you Fox News. You have once again saved Christmas.

<h>From "The Hill"

   <p>Brian Lamb, head honcho over at C-SPAN, has sent a letter to incoming
   Speaker Nancy Pelosi asking her to provide more options regarding the
   cameras in the House. For those who watch C-SPAN, you know that the
   camera is always trained on the person who speaking on the floor of
   the chamber. C-SPAN want that ability to pan the cameras and take
   reaction shots from those attending. It doesn't sound like Lamb to me.
   Reaction shots? The article has several errors. First, it claims that
   cameras were introduced into the House in 1979. What I think that the
   author means is cameras first went out to cable viewers who had access
   to C-SPAN in 1979. Cameras had been a feature in both chambers since
   the advent of the television itself. Second, the article notes that
   Lamb is asking Pelosi "...to roll back the three-decade old practice
   that put the House Speaker in charge of the cameras." That is also
   wrong. The control over the cameras is by the television technicians
   themselves, as written into the rules of the House. In 1984, Speaker
   of the House Tipp O'Neill brought a world of hurt on himself when he
   ordered the cameras to start panning an empty chamber to shed light in
   the dirty tricks crafted by Gingrich and other conservative
   Republicans. This whole event, mind you, could have been avoided had
   Brian Lamb chosen to inform his viewers that the House was in special
   orders speeches, and the whole place was virtually empty. Instead, he
   stayed mum and launched Gingrich into the political stratosphere.
   Hence it is bullocks whenever Lamb or anyone else at C-SPAN tell us
   that they are giving it to us straight when in fact the television
   cameras may be used to create a false sense of reality. Whose duty is
   it to square the record in these cases?
   <p>Second, which comes via "The Hill's" daily email "Tipsheet" is a story
   by Alexander Bolton, and it is a priceless one at that. On December 8,
   Democrats added a bill that would have given severance pay to
   Republican staffers who would be out on their ears right before
   Christmas. The Dems did it, as reported, because they remembered how
   horrible it was in 1994 when their staffers were tossed out of jobs
   with no support at all. The bill came to the floor late on December 8,
   and the Republican majority killed it. And the reason is simply
   priceless. Republican Representative Darrell Issa, from California,
   voted against the bill because it was "...one of those
   dark-of-the-night type pieces of legislation, and I am going to oppose
   it...it is not well thought out. It has not gone through the
   legislative process it should, and it is not a precedent we want to
   set haphazardly."
   <p>Nearly three years ago to the day, Republicans broke all kinds of
   procedural rules when they held a vote on the Medicare bill--normally
   a vote that lasts only 15 minutes--into a "three hour marathon" that
   lasted most of the night. Or how about the PATRIOT Act? The final bill
   was delivered to members of Congress around 5 or 6 in the morning and
   the vote for it was scheduled at 11 am the same day. Neither of these
   two things seemed to bother conservatives. Yet the difference here is
   in one they worked double time to help a wealthy benefactor--Big
   Pharma--and the other to bend over and take it from the
   administration. Here they were asked to provide some extra walk around
   money weeks before Christmas to the very staff who worked late into
   the night for these people, and they nothing. Give it up large for the
   House Republicans!

<h>Leahy In Da House

   <p>If you have been watching C-SPAN this week, you will have noticed that
   a lot of new Democrat Chairpersons have been holding their own press
   conferences, and it isn't a coincidence that they have. The Democrats
   are stealing a page from the Republican media strategy playbook by
   holding press conferences every day in order to make the news every
   day, and since Congress has adjourned, there isn't members who can
   respond in a way that the Republicans could have prior to ending the
   109th.
   <p>Leahy is at Georgetown Law School to inform all of us paying attention
   about the agenda of the Senate Judiciary Committee in the new term
   (although I am sort of surprised that this is not a joint-speech with
   House Judiciary Committee Conyers and wonder whether I should read
   anything into his absence?). Leahy promises more oversight and
   challenge to the administration's use of executive privilege. The
   administration had informally asserted executive privilege on behalf
   of nearly any executive branch official who had been summoned to
   testify. Traditionally, executive privilege was a power that only the
   president could assert. Early in Clinton's first term, Clinton tried
   and failed to assert executive privilege on behalf of Hillary in
   relation to the work she did on behalf of the Health Care reform task
   force. However, in W's first term, the privilege was extended to the
   VP over records pertaining to the energy task force. Given that the
   Republicans never challenged the assertion of the privilege on behalf
   of the attorney-general, or the Secretary or State, or the national
   security advisor, etc. We will see whether that leads to a new
   challenge before the Court.
   <p>Leahy tells us that AG Gonzalez will be before the Committee very
   soon, and he will not tolerate anyone who is summoned to appear
   showing up without answers and providing promises to get back to the
   Committee later. Leahy stated that no one ever got back to the
   Committee (although I wonder if they only got back to the majority?).
   <p>I have to say that I found one thing particularly interesting. There
   were questions mostly from reporters, and a number of reporters
   claimed to be working for publications I have not heard of, including
   one who works for a blog! Nonetheless, one gentlemen working with the
   Executive Intelligence Review (a publication that I do know) asked
   Leahy about signing statements, and for all the hullaballoo about
   signing statements in the last session of Congress, Leahy simply
   dodged answering the question. He made references to how the Congress
   was charged with lawmaking, and that was it. Nothing any more. It begs
   the question: Have Democrat outsiders persuaded Leahy that this is a
   power that Democrat presidents may use and thus it is best to allow
   the debate to stay out there in academic circles and nowhere else?
   <p>To my buddy who seems to get people jumping over the issue of the
   signing statement--how about dropping by Leahy's office and ask him,
   given Leahy's outrage last year, if he is planning on any substantive
   work on fencing in the president's use of the signing statement?
   <p>I am also surprised at how little Leahy said about his ability to make
   the administration turn over information. He was asked at least twice
   what he could do to make the administration comply with his commands.
   Once he said the Congress has power of the purse and confirmation
   powers, but didn't explain how these can work to force the president
   to bend. He also remarked about the subpoena power, but said little
   else. It could very well be that he was deliberately trying not to
   make news--for instance, it is clear that The Congress--either or both
   chambers--can cite recalcitrant executive branch officers with
   contempt of Congress, and clearly has in the past. But since this is
   high political drama, it could be that Leahy did not want tomorrow's
   headline to read: "LEAHY PREPARED TO HOLD PRESIDENT IN CONTEMPT.

<h>Hodge-Podge Tuesday

   <p>Last Friday's edition of "On the Media," Bob Garfield did an interview
   with journalists who cover the Supreme Court, and brought up the
   question once again of whether cameras should be allowed into the
   Court. It was a unanimous verdict (pardon the pun) to allow the
   cameras in. At no time did Garfield, or any of his guests, address the
   substantive reasons why cameras should remain outside. Here is Slate's
   Dahlia Lithwick:
   <p>They have good arguments and bad arguments for keeping cameras out.
   The bad arguments are we don't want to be recognized at the Safeway.
   That's not a good argument. The good arguments are once there's a
   camera trained on these attorneys, they're going to start barking like
   seals and acting goofy.
   <p>What of the ruination to the institution that seems to follow
   television cameras wherever they go? That cameras fail to provide
   context, that it favors process over substance, and that it generally
   attributes the large share of criminal activity to minorities--all
   empirical facts on local television and the judiciary.
   <p>On a different matter: I often skip right over the editorial section
   of the "Wall Street Journal," which is mostly loopy right-wing
   nonsense--no attempt to even take an intellectual approach to
   attacking Democrats and/or liberals. Mostly talk radio in written
   form. Last night, however, I decided to look through the editorial
   section and I am glad I did.
   <p>There was an editorial by Peter Kann on the problems with our
   media--or really, more of a plea to our press to at least try to act
   like the important institution the founding father's thought it was.
   Kann reminds us that it was Thomas Jefferson who said, when approached
   with the choice of a government without newspapers or newspapers
   without government, he would choose the latter. I am willing to bet he
   wouldn't make that same statement today.
   <p>Kann identifies 10 negative trends in our media--all of which are the
   most typical problems identified by those who study the press and
   politics:
     * <l>The blurring of lines between journalism and entertainment, or the
       rise of infotainment;
     * <l>The blurring of lines between news and opinion;
     * <l>The blending of news and advertising (video news releases and
       advertorials);
     * <l>Pack journalism;
     * <l>The focus on conflict to the detriment of consensus;
     * <l>The tendency towards negativity;
     * <l>The fascination with the bizarre, the perverse, and the
       pathological (or favoring soft news over hard news);
     * <l>Social orthodoxy or political correctness;
     * <l>The short attention span
     * <l>The failure to recognize the press is a political institution.

   <p>Enjoy the read!
