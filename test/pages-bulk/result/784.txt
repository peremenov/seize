                        <h>Surviving the Next Virus Attack

                               <h>--G. Morgan Watkins, Departmental Services

   <p>Back in the spring of 1988, computer security was largely a matter of
   "Make sure you lock the computer room door when you're done." Then a
   few rogue programs called "viruses" began to appear on the West Coast,
   spreading and replicating undercover from one computer to another and
   reaching the University several months later. First was the "Pakistani
   Brain" virus that struck UT Windows computers late that summer. Then
   the "Scores" virus attacked Macintoshes across campus, leaving many
   machines unusable for days.

   <p>In these two cases, UT had time to prepare a defense because the
   Internet highway was still largely under construction, and viruses
   spread mostly via shared diskettes. But despite early warnings, UT was
   still hit hard when the outbreak took place: significant service
   interruptions occurred, it wasn't easy to stop, there were no virus
   protection packages, and people didn't take the threat seriously.

   <p>Today, we have campus licenses for antivirus software, but we also
   have thousands of computer viruses skulking worldwide. Unfortunately,
   people still don't take the threat seriously enoughand the stakes are
   much higher. With millions of business-critical computers linked to
   the Internet, a particularly malignant virus could seriously damage
   the global economy in a single electronic blitzkrieg.

   <p>The latest major attack came on May 5, when the "Love Bug" infected
   Microsoft Outlook mail services and mailboxes across the world.
   Thousands of infected e-mail messages were generated on campus,
   spreading a potential disaster throughout the UT community.

   <p>Although Asia and Europe had already been struck by the Love Bug
   during the night, there were no official alerts to warn Americans.
   Even so, ACITS and many departmental computer administrators reacted
   immediately. Within minutes, ACITS personnel were phoning
   administrative and departmental contacts across campus, letting them
   know of the attack. Since e-mail might be seen only after it was too
   late, other staff posted signs in buildings and knocked on office
   doors. Some departments shut down their servers; others isolated their
   local networks; others braved out the attack but carefully reviewed
   their e-mail and refused to open any attachments. Throughout the
   blitz, ACITS' central services remained available while technical
   staff were busy stopping the influx of contaminated attachments. The
   Help Desk was on hand to assist, and UT's home page posted a prominent
   alert, directing people to useful information. Shortly after noon,
   seminars were given on how to eradicate the Love Bug. A special team
   remained on campus until late that night to help anyone who needed
   hands-on assistance. Campus-wide recovery efforts went well. In part
   it was the skills of dedicated staff across campus; in part it was
   luck.

   <p>Fortunately, the Love Bug was rather innocuous, its destructive power
   mostly limited to throwing away multimedia files and leaving droppings
   throughout system folders. It did not trash hard disks, and it was
   relatively easy to recognize. The Love Bug was not a terrorist act.
   But the next strike could well be.

  <h>For IT Managers: Be Prepared

   <p>We hope that computer users are finally aware of how vulnerable their
   electronic assets really are. In less than 24 hours, a poorly designed
   and simple piece of code caused $20 billion in damages. We must assume
   that virus creators are also aware of the destructive power now at
   their fingertips. To protect the University, we need better
   communication, organization, and preparation. The comments and
   suggestions below are directed to IT managers on campus.

   <p>Even careful planning won't give perfect security against attacksthere
   will always be holes in our defenses. The key to surviving an
   electronic incursion is to expect it. This includes planning ahead,
   reacting quickly, notifying the right people, finding solutions, and
   cleaning up the mess. Afterwards, a post-mortem should be done to
   learn how to react better the next time.

   <p>Generally, your most precious computer asset is your data, and
   anything you can do before hand to protect it could save you later.
   Keep your computers' operating systems and antivirus solutions
   up-to-date, and, above all, have reliable, daily backups using
   expertly managed servers. Making users responsible for system updates
   and backups is a poor solution. Keeping data on servers makes it
   easier to retrieve data from backups.

  <h>Have a Plan . . .

   <p>Know the location of all your departmental computing resources. If the
   department has desktop management procedures, that is, specific
   hardware, operating systems, and application suites that all members
   of a particular group use, it is much easier to recover from a
   disaster. If user data is stored on file servers and if standard
   system images are maintained, the road to normal operations is
   shorter. And this is true whether the incident is a virus attack, a
   fire, flood, or theft.

   <p>In the event of a security incident, such as a destructive virus,
   reaction time is crucial. Before it happens, organize an Emergency
   Response Team (ERT). You'll need an Incident Response Coordinator
   (IRC), a Communications Coordinator (CC), and an Incident Technical
   Leader (ITL). Depending on the size of your organization, you may need
   others to help make sure all the work gets done. The IRC coordinates
   the actions of the team and takes responsibility for decisions. The CC
   spreads the word and becomes the sole point of contact for the press.
   The ITL gathers necessary technical information, puts together
   solutions, and makes sure that the problem is cleaned up. Finally,
   members of the ERT must be trained and must have materials to help
   them deal with unexpected problems.

  <h>Get in Touch . . .

   <p>An ERT requires a communications plan. Who needs to be contacted if a
   virus or other attack is detected? The plan should have names, phone
   numbers, and the reason for calling each person or unit. There will be
   no time to work through the telephone book trying to hunt down phone
   numbers. Be sure ACITS is on the list. We can share information with
   departments and users and help assess the extent of the damage. Also,
   a current paper inventory listing of hardware and software assets,
   stored in a prearranged, secure location, could be essential during a
   severe attack.

   <p>An ERT checklist of steps to be taken and a set of forms to document
   work is also essential. One or more members of an ERT might not be
   available when a problem happens, and someone else may need to fill
   the role. Other items, such as preprinted instructions and signs for
   hallways should also be created and stored. Periodic disaster drills
   will keep the procedures fresh. An ERT is of little use if its members
   cannot be found. Departments should have emergency procedures posted
   in a central location to make it easy to find responsible parties at
   any time. Even if someone has agreed to wear a pager, there should be
   alternate contacts.

  <h>Diagnose the Problem . . .

   <p>Don't try to diagnose a security incident alone. Gather what
   information you can, but check with the Help Desk and other support
   sites, as well as within your college, to make sure you have all the
   facts. If the Internet is still accessible, check the UT home page to
   see if anything has been posted. Other excellent sites that track
   these kinds of problems include:

   <p>The National Infrastructure

     <l>Protection Center: www.nipc.gov
     <l>The SANS Institute: www.sans.org
     <l>The CERT Coordination Center: www.cert.org

   <p>Also, check private vendors, such as

     <l>Network Associates: www.nai.com
     <l>Symantec: www.symantec.com
     <l>Data Fellows: www.datafellows.com

   <p>It may be prudent to disconnect an affected machine from the campus
   network, but don't turn it off until you know what you're facing. Some
   viruses cause further damage during the boot process. Obviously, be
   careful not to trigger a virus on a system connected to the network or
   one that has useful information on its hard drive. Some viruses can
   disrupt firmware severely enough to make a system nearly
   unrecoverable. Moreover, avoid reading e-mail while logged in with a
   privileged account on a workstation or server. Conceivably, you could
   take down an entire facility by doing so. Finally, when you know what
   you've found, share that information with ACITS so that a general
   alert can be sounded.

  <h>Notify, Isolate, and Protect . . .

   <p>Getting the word out to your user community can be a problem during a
   cyber attack. Sometimes, sending information by e-mail is ill-advised,
   and telephone contact allows for immediate interchange. If people
   can't be reached by phone, knock on doors and post signs in hallways
   and on office doors. The key is to use all communications paths,
   depending on the severity of the incident.

   <p>If an attack is still underway, it may be prudent to disconnect your
   servers from the network, and then to disconnect compromised systems.
   Keep track of what machines have problems and mark them in some way so
   that others will know the machine has not been properly restored.
   Paper signs taped over the monitor screens are obvious indicators and
   will not fall off or be ignored. Affected machines should not be used
   until they have been cleaned up.

                              <h>Working Together

       <p>ACITS is organizing a series of symposiums to help departments and
         colleges coordinate their responses to cyber attacks. To be kept
   up-to-date on this, subscribe to the UT Technical Support mailing list
          by sending to listproc@lists.cc.utexas.edu the one-line message

     <p>subscribe vtechsupport
     firstname lastname

      kinds of emergencies, or if you want to find out how ACITS can help
      you manage your current resources, call Morgan Watkins at 475-9341.

  <h>Assess Damage and Research Solutions . . .

   <p>Once you know the scope of the problem, you'll need to begin planning
   your recovery. Systems that affect several users will almost certainly
   need a higher priority. Mobilize your Emergency Response Team to
   handle things methodically. The Incident Technical Leader will need to
   watch developments and talk with others facing the same problem.
   Reacting too quickly can actually make things worse or complicate
   recovery. During the Love Bug incident, several different ways to
   eradicate the virus were posted around the country, but not all of
   them were effective. Even the antivirus programs from vendors offered
   less-than-perfect solutions.

  <h>Clean Up and Do a Post-Mortem . . .

   <p>Keep affected systems offline until you have removed any compromised
   elements and can verify that the system has returned to normal. You
   may need to do fresh installs of the operating system and restore
   files from backup tapes. After that, your final task is to change all
   of your passwords and advise your network users to change their
   passwords.

   <p>Carefully review everything done during an incident, shortly after its
   resolution. Many lessons can be learned by studying the way that
   things were handled. Watch for announcements from ACITS of a general
   post-mortem so that others can learn from different approaches.
