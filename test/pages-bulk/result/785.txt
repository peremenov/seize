                               <h>Immunizations

   <p>To protect our employees and patients, all University of Tennessee
   Health Science Center faculty/staff should be evaluated to determine
   susceptibility to infectious diseases. Immunization and/or titers are
   offered for the following:


   <p>Learn more about vaccines and current recommendations.
   <p>To obtain a copy of your immunization record, please call
   (901)-448-5630. Allow 24 to 48 hours for your records to be processed.
   Records can be picked up in our office or mailed out to you. If you
   would like your records faxed please fax a signed release to (901)-
   448-7255.

<p>For those at risk to exposure, the following is required for all Medical
Center faculty, staff and housestaff:

   *       <p>Provide written documentation of two tuberculin skin test
   results during the 12 months prior to beginning practice, one of which
   needs to be within the past 12 months. If previous tuberculin skin
   test result is positive, clearance must be provided by the
   Memphis/Shelby County Health Dept.. Thereafter, a tuberculin skin test
   is required annually for all negative reactors..

   *       <p>Provide proof of varicella (chickenpox) immunity via a blood
   titer or documentation of disease or immunization

   *       <p>If born on or after January 1, 1957, provide proof of two
   immunizations for measles at least one month apart or immunity via a
   blood titer. (Persons born before this date are considered immune to
   measles)

   *       <p>Provide proof of one immunization for rubella or immunity via
   a blood titer

   *       <p>Provide proof of one immunization for mumps or immunity via a
   blood titer

   *       <p>For those who may be exposed to blood, body fluid or human
   tissue, the Hepatitis B vaccine is strongly encouraged and provided
   without charge, and the Occupational Safety and Health Act
   (OSHA)-mandated educational materials are provided. Employees those
   who choose to decline these services must sign a declination statement
   to that effect.

<h>Measles (Rubeola)

   <p>Measles is a highly contagious and often serious disease. Measles
   infection can have serious complications such as encephalitis,
   meningitis, and death. If you were born on or after January 1, 1957,
   you should receive the vaccine. For those born before January 1, 1957,
   the immunization is not required.

   <p>NOTE: You do not need to be revaccinated if you can provide
   documentation of two live measles vaccinations after your 1st birthday
   at least one month apart or laboratory evidence of immunity to measles
   (rubeola).

<h>Rubella

   <p>Rubella is a highly contagious viral illness with symptoms very
   similar to rubeola but differs in the severity of symptoms and length
   of illness. The most serious threat of rubella is to the pregnant
   female who has never had rubella. If exposed to rubella, they can
   contract the disease which can cause serious problems for the unborn
   baby.

   *       <p>How do I know if I'm immune? You are considered immune if you
   have had a rubella vaccine. If your birth date is before January 1,
   1957, you will not be required to have the immunization.

   *       <p>What if I'm not immune? If a blood test find you to be
   non-immune, meaning you do not have immunity to rubella, the MMR
   vaccine will be required..

   *       <p>What if I was born after January 1, 1957? For those born on or
   after this date, you will need to get the vaccine if the risk applies
   to you.

<h>Hepatitis A

   <p>Hepatitis A is a viral infection of the liver. Hepatitis A is
   transmitted primarily by person-to-person contact, generally through
   fecal contamination and oral ingestion. Transmission is facilitated by
   poor personal hygiene, poor sanitation, and intimate contact.

   *       <p>Who should get the vaccine? Persons encouraged to get the
   vaccine are those with an occupational risk of infection; such as day
   care personnel, sewage workers, military personnel, and those who work
   with infected primates or those who work with hepatitis A in a
   research setting. Others include: persons with chronic liver disease,
   international travelers to areas of high or intermediate risk of
   transmission, children living in communities with high rates of
   hepatitis A, sexually active homosexual and bisexual men, and IV drug
   users.

   *       <p>How can I get the vaccine? You must schedule an appointment
   with the University Health Services to discuss your need for the
   vaccine. If your need is determined to be related to your job, UHS
   will administer the vaccine and charge your department.. However, if
   your need is determined to be personal, you would be charged
   personnally for the vaccine.

<h>Hepatitis B

   <p>Hepatitis B is a viral infection of the liver caused by the Hepatitis
   B virus.

   *       <p>How is it transmitted? Hepatitis B can be transmitted to
   health care workers by exposure to blood or body fluids from hepatitis
   B infected patients. The risk of contracting hepatitis B from a
   needlestick with a hepatitis B contaminated needle is 35-40%. The risk
   from a splash to the eyes is much less. There is no cure for hepatitis
   B, but the vaccine can effectively prevent hepatitis B if you are
   exposed to the virus.

   *       <p>Who should take the vaccine? Anyone who is at risk for contact
   with blood or other potentially infectious materials is strongly
   encouraged to receive the hepatitis B vaccine series.
   PLEASE NOTE: The US Public Health Service recommends the hepatitis B
   vaccine series to all health care workers.

   *       <p>How much does it cost? The hepatitis B vaccine is offered by
   the university to all faculty/staff who, while performing their job,
   could come in contact with blood or other potentially infectious
   materials. Your department will be charged for the vaccine.

   *       <p>How is it administered? It is given as a series of three
   intramuscular injections: initial, one month later and six months
   later. UHS uses recombiant, noninfectious hepatitis B vaccine.

   *       <p>What if I don't want to take the vaccine? Anyone at risk for
   exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials who does
   not wish to take the hepatitis B vaccine must sign a refusal
   statement. However, if you later decide that you want the hepatitis B
   vaccine, UHS will provide you the vaccine at that time at no charge.
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires that
   all persons who, while performing their job, could possibly come in
   contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials be
   offered the hepatitis B vaccine series. See http://www.osha.gov.

<h>Influenza (Flu)

   <p>Influenza or flu is a viral infection of the nose, throat, bronchial
   tubes, and lungs that can make someone of any age ill.

   *       <p>When do you get the flu? The flu season in the United States
   is generally from about November through April.

   *       <p>What are the symptoms of the flu? You usually have fever,
   chills, cough, and soreness and aching in your back, arms, and legs.

   *       <p>How long does the flu last? Although most people are ill for
   only a few days, some people have a much more serious illness that
   could even result in a hospital visit. On average, thousands of people
   die each year in the United Stated from the flu or related
   complications.
   *       <p>Who should get a flu shot? Any one wishing to reduce their
   chances of catching the flu should get the vaccine. Health
   professionals and others in both hospital and outpatient-care settings
   who have contact with high-risk patients in all age groups, including
   children are strongly encouraged to receive the immunization.

   *       <p>Who should NOT get a flu shot? Any one with an allergy to eggs
   that causes dangerous reactions and anyone who has ever been paralyzed
   with Guillain Barre syndrome should NOT get the vaccine. Women who are
   or might be pregnant should consult their doctor. Persons who are ill
   and have fever should wait to take the shot until the fever or others
   symptoms are gone.
   *       <p>How often do I need a flu shot? Because the viruses that cause
   flu frequently change and because any immunity developed in the
   previous year possibly decreases, it is recommended that you receive
   the vaccination every year.

   *       <p>Who is eligible for the shot and how much does it cost? The
   flu shot is given free of charge to all UTHSC faculty/staff and
   students.

   *       <p>Can I get the flu from getting the shot? Since all viruses in
   the vaccine are killed, the vaccine cannot infect anyone.

   *       <p>How long does it take to start working? The vaccine will begin
   to provide protection about one to two weeks after you receive the
   vaccine and immunity may decrease, on average, after several months.

   *       <p>Can I still get the flu after taking the shot? Flu shots will
   not protect everyone from the flu. The flu shot also cannot protect
   you against other illnesses that resemble the flu.

   *       <p>When does UHS give the flu shots? Flu shots are given by UHS
   from October 1 through Janunary 15 of each year.

<h>Rabies

   <p>Rabies is a viral infection of the central nervous system. The virus
   is contained in the saliva and certain body materials of rabid animals
   and humans.

   *       <p>How do you get it? The most common way a person is exposed to
   rabies is through bites by rabid animals.

   *       <p>What is the Rabies vaccine? The rabies vaccine is an
   inactivated-virus vaccine, available in both human diploid cell
   vaccine and rabies vaccine absorbed. Human rabies immune globulin is
   used in postexposure treatment of persons not previously immunized
   with rabies vaccine.

   *       <p>Who needs the vaccine? All persons exposed to rabies virus,
   regardless of prior immunization should get the vaccine. Persons whose
   occupations or activities place them at increased risk of exposure
   include laboratory workers, forest rangers, taxidermists,
   veterinarians, stock breeders, hunters, and spelunkers and persons
   planning to be more than 30 days in an area where rabies is a constant
   threat should get the vaccine.

<h>Varicella (chicken pox)

   <p>Chicken pox, usually a mild childhood illness caused by the varicella
   virus, can cause severe problems for adults who have never had chicken
   pox. These adults, especially pregnant women, the elderly, and
   immunocompromised persons, can develop serious complications, such as
   dehydration, pneumonia, meningitis, and even death.

   *       <p>How will I know if I'm immune? UHS will draw blood for a
   varicella antibody test.  A positive antibody titer means you have had
   chicken pox and are unlikely to get it again. With a positive antibody
   titer, you may work with patients who have chicken pox, even if you
   are pregnant.

   <p>NOTE: You will not need this varicella blood test if you have
   laboratory documentation of a positive varicella titer.

   *      <p>If I had chicken pox as a child, isn't that good enough?
   Yes.UHS will accept medical documentation of past disease.

   *  <p>What if I'm immune? If you are immune, no further action is needed.
   This result will be entered into the UHS database and the laboratory
   report will be filed in your permanent medical record.

   *       <p>What if I'm NOT immune? At this time you will be offered the
   Varivax (varicella virus vaccine) vaccination.
   NOTE: If you are non-immune, you must inform your supervisor and UHS
   of any known contact with a person who has chicken pox, whether at
   work or away from work. University Health will assess your exposure
   and determine if it is safe for you to work with patients during the
   incubation period for chicken pox.

   *       <p>What is the Varivax Vaccine? It is a series of two injections
   given one month apart of the Varicella Virus Vaccine. This is a live
   virus and is approximately 95% effective in preventing chicken pox.

<h>Smallpox (or the pox virus)

   <p>Smallpox was an acute, contagious illness characterized by fever,
   backache, and prostration followed by the appearance of an eruption of
   papules and vesicles which became pustular by the eighth day.
