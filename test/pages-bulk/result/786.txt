                   <h>Critical Reading Towards Critical Writing

     <p>Critical writing depends on critical reading. Most of the papers
     you write will involve reflection on written texts - the thinking
     and research that has already been done on your subject. In order
     to write your own analysis of this subject, you will need to do
     careful critical reading of sources and to use them critically to
     make your own argument. The judgments and interpretations you make
     of the texts you read are the first steps towards formulating your
     own approach.

  <h>Critical Reading: What is It?

     <p>To read critically is to make judgements about how a text is
     argued. This is a highly reflective skill requiring you to "stand
     back" and gain some distance from the text you are reading. (You
     might have to read a text through once to get a basic grasp of
     content before you launch into an intensive critical reading.) THE
     KEY IS THIS:
     * <l>don't read looking only or primarily for information
     * <l>do read looking for ways of thinking about the subject matter

     <p>When you are reading, highlighting, or taking notes, avoid
     extracting and compiling lists of evidence, lists of facts and
     examples. Avoid approaching a text by asking "What information can
     I get out of it?" Rather ask "How does this text work? How is it
     argued? How is the evidence (the facts, examples, etc.) used and
     interpreted? How does the text reach its conclusions?

                                                                  

  <h>How Do I Read Looking for Ways of Thinking?

    <p>1. First determine the central claims or purpose of the text (its
       thesis). A critical reading attempts to assess how these central
       claims are developed or argued.
    <p>2. Begin to make some judgements about context . What audience is the
       text written for? Who is it in dialogue with? (This will probably
       be other scholars or authors with differing viewpoints.) In what
       historical context is it written? All these matters of context can
       contribute to your assessment of what is going on in a text.
    <p>3. Distinguish the kinds of reasoning the text employs. What concepts
       are defined and used? Does the text appeal to a theory or
       theories? Is any specific methodology laid out? If there is an
       appeal to a particular concept, theory, or method, how is that
       concept, theory, or method then used to organize and interpret the
       data? You might also examine how the text is organized: how has
       the author analyzed (broken down) the material? Be aware that
       different disciplines (i.e. history, sociology, philosophy,
       biology) will have different ways of arguing.
    <p>4. Examine the evidence (the supporting facts, examples, etc) the
       text employs. Supporting evidence is indispensable to an argument.
       Having worked through Steps 1-3, you are now in a position to
       grasp how the evidence is used to develop the argument and its
       controlling claims and concepts. Steps 1-3 allow you to see
       evidence in its context. Consider the kinds of evidence that are
       used. What counts as evidence in this argument? Is the evidence
       statistical? literary? historical? etc. From what sources is the
       evidence taken? Are these sources primary or secondary?
    <p>5. Critical reading may involve evaluation. Your reading of a text is
       already critical if it accounts for and makes a series of
       judgments about how a text is argued. However, some essays may
       also require you to assess the strengths and weaknesses of an
       argument. If the argument is strong, why? Could it be better or
       differently supported? Are there gaps, leaps, or inconsistencies
       in the argument? Is the method of analysis problematic? Could the
       evidence be interpreted differently? Are the conclusions warranted
       by the evidence presented? What are the unargued assumptions? Are
       they problematic? What might an opposing argument be?

                                                                    

  <h>Some Practical Tips

    <p>1. Critical reading occurs after some preliminary processes of
       reading. Begin by skimming research materials, especially
       introductions and conclusions, in order to strategically choose
       where to focus your critical efforts.
    <p>2. When highlighting a text or taking notes from it, teach yourself
       to highlight argument: those places in a text where an author
       explains her analytical moves, the concepts she uses, how she uses
       them, how she arrives at conclusions. Don't let yourself
       foreground and isolate facts and examples, no matter how
       interesting they may be. First, look for the large patterns that
       give purpose, order, and meaning to those examples. The opening
       sentences of paragraphs can be important to this task.
    <p>3. When you begin to think about how you might use a portion of a
       text in the argument you are forging in your own paper, try to
       remain aware of how this portion fits into the whole argument from
       which it is taken. Paying attention to context is a fundamental
       critical move.
    <p>4. When you quote directly from a source, use the quotation
       critically. This means that you should not substitute the
       quotation for your own articulation of a point. Rather, introduce
       the quotation by laying out the judgments you are making about it,
       and the reasons why you are using it. Often a quotation is
       followed by some further analysis.
    <p>5. Critical reading skills are also critical listening skills. In
       your lectures, listen not only for information but also for ways
       of thinking (see the Health Sciences Writing Centre's link on
       Making Notes from Lectures). Your instructor will often explicate
       and model ways of thinking appropriate to a discipline.
