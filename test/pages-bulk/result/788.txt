             <h>Q. When do I need Workers' Compensation coverage?

                                                                   

           <p>In California, as soon as you hire your first employee.
       <h>Q. When do I need Professional/Cyberspace liability coverage?
      <p>If your company provides professional advice or services to others
    there is always a chance of an unintentional error or omission being
   made by you or one of your employees. Professional Liability provides
    coverage for economic loss (as opposed to General Liability coverage
    which covers Bodily Injury or Property damage to third parties) and
              usually includes defense costs coverage as well.
    <h>Q. How does an insurance broker/agent obtain insurance quotations on
                            my company's behalf?
        <p>Your broker or agent receives permission from you to send out
      specifications of insurance to various insurance carriers. These
   specifications describe your business and your exposures to loss. The
      underwriter from the insurance carrier and your agent negotiates
   coverage and cost for your business insurance needs. Your broker/agent
   proposes coverage and cost based upon the negotiated terms, conditions
                 and pricing to you, for a final decision.
        <h>Q. How do I obtain a quotation on my Personal Automobile and
                           Homeowners insurance?

                                                                   

     <p>We provide personal insurance coverage through various carriers. If
    you are interested in quotes, please fill out the forms and fax them
       back to us. We can usually turn indication around in 48 hours.
        <h>Q. How do I know if my broker or agent is doing his/her job?
       <p>Service is the fist clue - and the most important aspect. Claims
       handling is also important, not to mention favorable terms and
     conditions in your insurance contract, comparison shopping of your
                       renewal coverage and pricing.
                <h>Q. When should I change my brokers or agent?
     <p>When you are unhappy with the service or expertise provided, or not
                provided, by your existing broker or agent.
              <h>Q. Should I have more than one broker or agent?
      <p>Generally start-up companies have one to three business insurance
   brokers because: 1) they don't understand how the process works, or 2)
   insurance isn't a priority until the costs start increasing, or 3) one
   of the investors has a friend who is an insurance broker. As the level
    of a Company's sophistication rises they realize the inadequacies of
       this type of system and generally have one broker for Business
        Insurance and possibly one other broker for Employee Benefit
    insurance. This enhances the buying power and ability of each broker
     to negotiate favorable terms and conditions for your two insurance
                                 programs.

                                                                   

                    <h>Q. What does assigning markets mean?
          <p>If you decide to have more than one broker or agent obtain
   quotations on your behalf it is wise to assign each one, the specific
    insurance markets they may approach. Generally the top three or four
    choices made by the broker/agent are assigned to the agent or broker
    that chooses them, if there is no conflict with the other brokers or
                                  agents.
         <h>Q. Should I buy an insurance program based on lowest cost?
        <p>Not necessarily. Bottom line costs up front are not always an
      accurate reflection of total costs over the policy term. 1. For
       instance, poor claims handling can substantially increase your
    indirect costs this year and your indirect costs over the next four
   years under a Workers' Compensation policy. 2. Another factor might be
    an auditable policy based on sales or receipts which increases your
        total costs far beyond expectations by the end of the year.
     <h>Q. How do I know if the insurance carrier quoting my insurance is
          financially stable and responsive to claims submitted? 

                                                                   

     <p>In order to determine financial stability and claims paying history
      of a property/casualty insurance company you can look them up on
    www.ambest.com and look under - Rating Information - Rating Search -
    by insurance company name. This rating gives you a good idea of the
    insurance company's ability to pay claims in the event of a covered
    loss, and a good indication of their financials for future stability
                         and claims paying ability.
              <h>Q. What limits of insurance do I need to carry?
     <p>Minimum Limits of Liability for a start-up organization should be at
   least $1,000,000 and preferably $5,000,000. As a start-up - you don't
   want to go out of business before you really get started - which could
    happen in the event of a loss. 1) As your organization grows larger
    and becomes more successful the possibilities of loss become greater
      because the organization usually has more clients/customers and
      therefore usually more exposure. It is not unusual for mid-sized
    organizations to insure their liability for limits in excess of $50
    Million. 2) At a given point - as the organization begins to see the
   cost of insurance as a large expense item, they start taking measures
     to better control their losses, hire an insurance risk manager and
                   perhaps even look into self-insurance.
                     <h>Q. What is Professional Liability?
     <p>Covers economic loss and is designed to protect your company against
     actual or alleged breach of duty, negligent act, error or omission
       committed in rendering, or the failure to render, professional
         services as identified in the application and the policy.
                        <h>Q. What is Cyber Liability?

                                                                   

     <p>Covers errors and omissions in providing internet related services,
        as well as for claims of copyright for content or trademark
           infringement, computer virus and unauthorized access.
                          <h>Q. What is Loss Control?
     <p>Loss control services provided by your insurance carrier and or your
    broker reduces your company's exposure to loss. The services vary by
     coverage, risk and carrier and can sometimes be unbundled meaning
                             bought separately.
          <h>Q. What is an Additional Insured and who requires them?
     <p>An Additional Insured (AI) is just that, and is usually required by
        the lessors, lenders, loss payables, clients, customers and
       contractors that have an interest in the insureds business. 1)
     Insurance carriers may charge an additional fee in order to name a
      party as an additional insured on the insurance contract. 2) In
     addition, many of the Additional Insureds require other terms and
     conditions that are not acceptable to the insurance carrier. It is
      best to check with your agent or broker to see if the insurance
     carrier will extend the coverage to the AI, before obligating your
                    company to the provisions requested.
