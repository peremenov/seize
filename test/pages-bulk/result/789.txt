<h>TOWER K-9: German shepherd on duty

   <p>How much was that doggy in the tower? Stratosphere officials declined
   to reveal how much money they shelled out for their newest fuzzy,
   four-legged security officer, but according to marketing director
   Chuck Davidson this was no pound puppy.

   <p>"He was a sizable investment. We took a lot of time and spent a lot of
   money. There's two things you look at in a dog, ability and
   temperament. A lot of times it's a trade off. You either get a great
   dog that's technically proficient in his skills or you get one with a
   great temperament. We spent the money to get both. He's very gentle.
   Little kids come up to him and grab him in the face and he's just fine
   with it. He enjoys the attention, but when he gets the command, he's
   all business."

   <p>Dex Von Der Pulschnitzquelle, is a full-blood German shepherd who was
   actually born in Germany. In fact, his commands are still in German.
   The dog arrived in the United States for training at Rudy Dexler's
   School for Dogs in Elkhart, Ind. in October and he's been on the job
   since December. When he's not being petted and pampered by hotel
   guests and employees, the canine is hard at work learning the ropes in
   a new high-rise home where even riding an escalator can be a
   challenge.

   <p>Dex doesn't go it alone though. Stratosphere security guard Steve
   Lieberman, a guard who has been with the property since it opened in
   1996, was selected to be the dog's constant companion.

   <p>"I had a German shepherd up until my early 20s. I really didn't want
   another dog at that point. I just didn't feel I'd get one as good as
   Silver. But when I heard that they were going to have a trained dog, I
   knew that would be something I'd like to do," he said.

   <p>Lieberman beat out more than a dozen other hopefuls to get the job.
   Then he spent almost a month in Indiana training with Dex at the
   school for dogs.

   <p>Dex is trained in obedience, explosive detection, area, article and
   building search, criminal apprehension, tracking and scouting.

   <p>"He's here to ensure the safety of the customers along with the
   associates and employees that work at the property. That includes
   everything from patrolling the casino and parking garages all the way
   to the executive offices and the tower shop mall here, along with the
   tower and the base of the tower," Davidson said. "With the addition of
   Dex, we have what we feel is one of the most significant security
   forces in the city which is very appropriate not only with the events
   of Sept. 11 but for everything that occurs here at this property."

   <p>Dex and Lieberman are on call 24 hours a day. At night they both go
   home to Lieberman's southwest Las Vegas home. During their off hours
   the duo are planning to be of service to the community beyond the
   tower's walls.

   <p>"We're working closely with (local police) and the fire department to
   make Dex available when the need arises in the community for a dog of
   his kind. Also we're in the process of working with the Clark County
   School District to start a K-9 awareness program where the local
   schools can become familiar with what a dog like Dex is used for,"
   Davidson said.

   <p>Dex already has his own security badge (worn by Lieberman who said the
   dog's better looking) and his own business cards.

   <p>"We have some plastic badges coming in that will say Stratosphere K-9
   Unit, have his name on it and a picture of a German shepherd. There
   also may be some training cards," Lieberman said.

   <p>So far, Dex is fitting in great.

   <p>"Everything has been positive in the casino. Every time I walk through
   the retail mall or even the casino, I hear people remarking how
   beautiful he is to begin with. But they also like the idea of a dog in
   the casino. They feel safe," Lieberman said.

   <p>Sales Coordinator Betty Sullivan never thought she liked dogs, until
   she met Dex.

   <p>"Usually I'm very afraid of dogs, but this one is so friendly. I gave
   him a birthday card on his 2-year birthday and everyone signed it. He
   can't read, but I gave it to Steve and he'll read it to him."

   <p>"For all of his training, he's unbelievably friendly," Davidson said.
   "You can pet him, you can play with him."

   <p>"He enjoys working," Lieberman said, "and the petting from all guests
   and the associates don't seem to make a difference to the job. When
   it's time to work he'll work."

   <p>Dex's press conference Jan. 22 was interrupted when the dog sniffed a
   suspicious rental truck in the parking lot. Lieberman said rental
   trucks are frequently false alarms since the trucks are often used to
   transport fireworks, which can leave a residue.

   <p>"He'll hit on any type of black powder, smokeless powder, flash
   powder, fuses, military or civilian detonators, explosives, firearms
   or even ammunition," Lieberman said.

   <p>For Dex, it's all play.

    <p>"Everything is a game to him. He has no idea this is work," Lieberman
   added.
