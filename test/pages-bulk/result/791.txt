   <h>New Era of Opportunity for Israel and the Palestinians

   <p>A historic breakthrough that might lead to an end of the bloodshed is
   possible, says Fawaz Gerges, professor of Middle Eastern and
   international affairs at Sarah Lawrence College in New York.


   <p>Mr. Gerges says, "this is the beginning of a highly complex journey.
   It is very messy, risky and extremely unpredictable."


   <p>Since the breakdown of talks at Camp David four years ago, the
   conflict has left more than three thousand Palestinians and over one
   thousand Israelis dead.  But with new Palestinian leadership emerging
   after the death of Yasser Arafat and a second term for U.S. President
   Bush, Mr. Gerges and many other analysts believe this is a watershed
   moment.


   <p>In an unusual overture, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said he is
   ready to coordinate a

                                                               
    <p>Mahmoud Abbas is the frontrunner in the Palestinian presidential race

   pullout from the Gaza Strip with a future Palestinian government and
   foresees what he calls possible 'years of peace.'  Most analysts agree
   that recent statements by the Palestinian presidential frontrunner
   Mahmoud Abbas, reflect a change in tone on the part of the Palestinian
   Authority.  Mr. Abbas said the armed uprising against Israel was a
   mistake, and that any resistance against Israeli occupation should be
   through non-violent means.


   <p>However, Mr. Abbas's position will need to be reinforced if he is to
   confront militant groups that attack Israelis, according to Steve
   Yetiv, professor of political science at Old Dominion University in
   Virginia.


   <p>Mr. Yetiv says, "I think it is somewhat pointless to move ahead with a
   serious peace process until Mr. Abbas, who appears to be the leader in
   the January 9th elections, is strengthened.  Mr. Abbas is not going to
   crack down on extremists if he does not have strength, and the
   Israelis who have fallen out of the peace process because of
   insecurity are not going to trust Mr. Abbas unless he is stronger."

   <p>Mr. Yetiv adds that Israel can make some concessions that would
   fortify Mr. Abbas.  Paul Scham, an Israeli-Arab scholar at the Middle
   East Institute in Washington, agrees, saying Israel should no longer
   require that all terrorist attacks stop before it comes to the
   negotiating table with the Palestinians.


   <p>"The fact is that these attacks will probably continue," says Mr.
   Scham.  "To demand absolute quiet from the Palestinians means that
   nothing will go anywhere.  The Israeli government and the Israeli
   people recognize that to suspend everything at that point would
   empower the terrorists."


   <p>With the possibility of continuing bloodshed on both sides not being
   ruled out, Sarah Lawrence College's Fawaz Gerges says the best chance
   for sustained peace in the Middle East rests on decisive U.S.
   presidential leadership.


   <p>"The intervention of the United States is crucial," says Mr. Gerges, "
   not only to enable the

                                                                
        <p>Palestinians will go to the polls throughout 2005 to vote for new
                                                               leadership

   emerging Palestinian leadership to rebuild their political and
   security institutions, but also to impress on the Israeli interest
   that it is in their own vital interest that a settlement based on two
   viable states living side by side is achieved.  Most importantly,
   after the elections, the United States must actively engage in peace
   making."


   <p>Mr. Gerges notes the United States took a hands-off approach to the
   conflict in the last couple of years.  U.S. officials described the
   late Palestinian President Yasser Arafat as an obstacle to peace,
   accusing him of backing militant attacks against Israel.  But with the
   election of new Palestinian leadership, President Bush says he will
   make resolving the Middle East conflict a top priority, reiterating
   his goal of establishing a Palestinian state alongside Israel.


   <p>The United States is donating about $25,000,000 to help the
   Palestinian Authority carry out the January elections.  The European
   Union and the international community at large have also offered
   millions of dollars in aid, and will be sending international
   observers to monitor the elections.


   <p>Old Dominion University's Steve Yetiv says other countries,
   particularly neighboring Arab states, should go even further to
   support Mahmoud Abbas and the peace process.  He says recent gestures
   by Egypt are positive developments.


   <p>Mr. Yetiv says, "they did not react negatively to the Israeli idea of
   withdrawing from Gaza and they seem to be willing to play a caretaker
   role after the withdrawal.  They are supportive of Abbas though he is
   generally more moderate than the other key actors on the Palestinian
   scene."


   <p>As a result, many observers are cautiously optimistic, even though
   they concede that some extreme elements on both sides do not want
   peace.  But with substantial U.S. involvement and world support, they
   say peace in the Middle East is possible in 2005.
