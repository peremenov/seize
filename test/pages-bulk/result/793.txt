   <h>The History of Marriage Within the Church
   as it Pertains to Gay Marriage
   <h>By Wally Bryen

   <p>The subject of the recognition and blessing of the marriages by those
   in homosexual relationships has been a hotly debated topic in recent
   years. In a time of record deficit spending, the president has stated
   that the government will spend 1.5 billion dollars on the defense of
   marriage to ensure that only heterosexual men and women will be
   allowed to marry. The recent Massachusetts Supreme Court ruling that
   it is unconstitutional to prevent homosexuals from participating in
   the rights and responsibilities of marriage has caused a firestorm of
   protests by both civil and church leaders. It is often said that
   beginning with Adam and Eve God has ordained the institution of
   marriage as a holy rite. The marriage of gays is thus seen as an
   attack on the sanctity of the institution of marriage. Gay marriage
   has been described as a sacrilege undercutting the very definition of
   marriage that has existed from the dawn of recorded history.
   <p>Looking closer at the Biblical and historical record shows us that
   ideas of marriage have changed considerably over the millennia.
   Practices once deemed perfectly acceptable are now considered to be
   abhorrent. The New Testament can be seen at times to radically change
   the understanding of marriage resulting in a much more empowered
   position for women in marriage, even as at other times it seems to
   firmly place women under the subjection of men. Can it be that
   marriage is not the monolithic entity it is so often purported to be
   in the rhetoric opposing gay marriage? Perhaps there are ways of
   faithfully looking at both scripture and the values held by the church
   that leave open the possibility of the church affirming and blessing
   gay marriages.
   <p>Even though the Bible has been used as a source of the idea that
   marriage is a sacred rite ordained by God from the beginning of
   history, there is surprisingly little discussion in the Hebrew or New
   Testament scriptures about what a marriage actually is. A search for
   the words marriage, marry or wife in the Bible yield numerous verses.
   Yet virtually none of these discusses exactly what a marriage is. One
   is hard pressed to find verses containing anything resembling the Lord
   says a marriage happens when or marriage is Gods way of or the reason
   the Lord wants us to be married is. There are cases where the emphasis
   is on making sure the Israelites do not marry foreigners such as in
   Nehemiah 13:27 Shall we then listen to you and do all this great evil
   and act treacherously against our God by marrying foreign women?(All
   scripture references are New Revised Standard Version unless otherwise
   noted.). There are also instances where a marriage is seen as a way of
   forming alliances as in 2 Chronicles 18:1 Now Jehoshaphat had great
   riches and honor; and he made a marriage alliance with Ahab. Leviticus
   18:18 instructs men that you shall not take a woman as a rival to her
   sister, uncovering her nakedness while her sister is still alive.
   Interestingly, the explicit reference to the prohibition on marrying
   two sisters seems to imply that it would be acceptable to have more
   than one wife as long as they were not related, a practice certainly
   frowned upon in modern times. The majority of cases in scripture seem
   to simply assume that marriage is a preexisting cultural entity and
   that the reader would understand what a marriage is without further
   explanation. But just what was this cultural entity in ancient times?
   <p>In the vast majority of cases where it is discussed in the Hebrew
   scriptures marriage is presented as a rather one-sided transaction.
   Daughters are usually seen as objects given in marriage by their
   fathers. Genesis 34:21 states let us take their daughters in marriage,
   and let us give them our daughters. In I Kings 11:19 there is even an
   account of Pharaoh giving the sister of his wife as a bride to Hadad.
   Often the husband is not even the party negotiating for the bride, but
   the father of the husband, as in 2 Kings 14:9 give your daughter to my
   son for a wife. Seldom if ever is the wife portrayed as having any
   decision-making power in the choice of a husband, or even any input on
   the subject. Yamauch supports this view by noting that in ancient
   Mesopotamia marriages were arranged by parentsthe consent of the bride
   was not necessary(Yamauch 1978, 241). There are few if any references
   in the Bible to the minimum age of brides, but an indication of likely
   minimum ages can be seen gleaned in noting that in ancient Egypt girls
   were married between the ages of twelve and fourteen (Yamauch 1978,
   242). Arranged marriages are certainly still prevalent in many
   cultures across the globe. However, in the West particularly in the
   United States, the idea of a woman as the property of her father and
   being forced to marry against her will and become the property of her
   husband is now usually seen as overly oppressive to the freedom of
   women. Furthermore, an attempt by a grown man to marry what modern
   society calls a girl of twelve years old would be seen now as a
   heinious act of pedophilia.
   <p>There is usually very little mention of love in the romantic sense as
   a basis for marriage in the Hebrew scriptures. When there is any
   mention of love it is usually a matter of what the potential husband
   wants, with no concern mentioned about the womans wishes. Such is the
   case in the Genesis 29 account of Jacob who loved Rachel, yet there is
   no mention of a reciprocal love on the part of Rachel for Jacob. Later
   in the story, when Rachel and her sister Leah are both married to
   Jacob, the sisters squabbles are not over the love of Jacob, but over
   who will bear him sons and thus inherit the wealth of Jacob. The
   inheritance of this wealth would thus enable the son to care for the
   mother. Additionally, this account of multiple wives is neither
   frowned upon within the story, nor is it the only such case in the
   Bible. There is even an instance where God appears to bless the union
   of a man with his maidservants, as in the story of Abimelech in
   Genesis 20. In this story, after Abimelech returns Sarah to Abraham
   God blesses him by healing his wife and maidservants so that they bear
   children. While it doesnt explicitly state the maidservants bore him
   children, it strongly implies such. Sarah herself gives her own
   servant Hagar to Abraham as a wife to bear him children. Sarah is even
   described as Abrahams half sister. While many modern societies might
   frown on these practices, they are presented within these canonical
   scriptural stories with a matter-of-fact nonchalance as if that is
   just the way things were done at the time.
   <p>Men were seemingly seen as the source of life itself in marriage
   relationships, as can be seen in Adams declaration in Genesis 4:1 that
   I have produced a man with the help of the Lord. There is no mention
   of we made a man implying a partnership with Eve, or indeed even the
   knowledge of the basic biological facts of procreation as we know them
   today. The event is portrayed as a creative act between God and Adam,
   with Eve merely providing a place for the child to grow. This focus on
   procreation had a great deal to do with the inheritance of wealth.
   Wives were expected to bear children for their husbands in large part
   so that the man would have an heir to inherit his wealth. While the
   right of a widow to inherit the property of her deceased husband was
   generally recognized in the cultures of the Ancient Near East (Davies
   1981, 138), such was not the case in ancient Hebrew society. If a
   Hebrew wife had no male children then the nearest kinsmen of the
   husband would have succeeded to the estate(Davies 1981, 138-9). This
   precarious situation of childless widows is likely a source of the
   Bibles emphasis on concern for widows and orphans. One possible
   exception that allowed a woman with no sons to participate in her
   husbands estate was known as the Levirate marriage in which the
   brothers of the deceased had the responsibility of providing the widow
   with male heirs(Davies 1981, 139). The assumption seems to be that the
   male heirs that inherited the husbands estate would then be able to
   care for their mother. Such an arrangement would be almost unthinkable
   today.
   <p>The New Testament sometimes seems to reemphasize the Hebrew scriptures
   subordinate status of the wife. In 1 Corinthians 11:3 Paul states that
   Christ is the head of every man, and the husband is the head of his
   wife. Throughout the New Testament Christ is referred to as out Lord
   and ruler. In this context of Christ as our ruler, it would be easy to
   view these verses in I Corinthians as laying out the natural order of
   humanity: Christ is the ruler of men, and husbands are the rulers of
   wives. Indeed, church leadership has often used these scriptures to
   defend just such a position. Yet this passage is sandwiched between
   discussions of church liturgical and eating practices with emphasis on
   the prevention of becoming a stumbling block to new believers. It
   seems quite a bit out of place to throw in a few verses about the
   rightful place of women in the middle of these chapters. Further, Paul
   is undoubtedly speaking to the prevailing cultural practices when he
   says shortly thereafter in 11:14 does not nature itself teach you that
   if a man wears long hair, it is degrading to him? The readers in
   Corinth would see it as self-evident that a woman should have long
   hair, and a man should have short hair. Yet many cultures do not hold
   that men should have short hair. God even gave Samson a covenant of
   strength through his long hair. It is entirely possible and probable
   that Pauls assessment of the husband as head of the wife reflected not
   an edit of the way things must be, but a reflection of how things were
   at the time. We are then left with the prospect of determining how we
   apply the overriding principles to our culture today.
   <p>Paul emphasizes the more egalitarian nature of life in Christ when he
   states in Galatians 3:38 that there is no longer Jew or Greek, there
   is no longer slave or free, there is no longer male and female; for
   you are one in Christ. In Ephesians 5:31 Paul instructs each husband
   to love his wife as himself. The modern Western notion of marriage as
   originating between two people who love each other so much that they
   want to spend their lives together can make a reading of Ephesians
   5:33 seem to be merely a friendly reminder to not fall out of love.
   This message of love toward wives came at a time when wives were seen
   by the larger society as virtual chattel property for the benefit of
   the husband. This notion of treating a wife with a spirit of love
   instead of ownership can be seen as a very empowering egalitarian
   message of the value and dignity of wives.
   <p>The verses immediately prior to Ephesians 5:31 can also be seen to be
   a reinterpretation of the passage so often quoted in order to show the
   divine order of marriage as solely between man and woman. Genesis 2:24
   reads Therefore a man leaves his father and mother and clings to his
   wife, and they become one flesh. He restates it not as a reflection of
   the natural biological order of humanity as created in two genders.
   Here in Ephesians 5:29-32 his emphasis is on the unity in Christ: for
   no one ever hates his own body, but he nourishes and tenderly cares
   for it, just as Christ does for the church, because we are members of
   his body. For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and
   be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh. This New
   Testament notion recasts marriage away from a transaction of property
   and domination towards a relationship of mutual respect and
   partnership.
   <p>Even though the nature of marriage changes somewhat in the New
   Testament, it is still not recorded in the scriptures as something
   that happens under the authority of the church. Even in the Byzantine
   era marriage could be seen to happen through a blessing, or crowning,
   or a contract (Viscuso 1991, 310). This notion of blessing here refers
   to betrothal (Viscuso 1991, 310). This betrothal was not fully a
   marriage, but the promise that such marriage would take place. The
   betrothal differed from a mere verbal agreement, which would have been
   considered an engagement, in the fact that a betrothal was brought
   about or celebrated through a sacred blessingwhose central feature was
   a prayerthat the betrothal might be confirmed and made indissoluble
   (Viscuso 1991, 312). Eventually the church began to see marriage as a
   sacrament imparting grace.
   <p>During the Reformation Protestant marriage theory began to take shape:
   the legitimacy and significance of civil authority over the
   institution was recognized; the sacramental status which the Roman
   Catholic Church accorded the institution was removed (Yates 1985, 41).
   Yates further notes that Martin Luther considered marriage an order of
   creation whose origin transcended both church and state (Yates, 1985
   41). This thought by Luther began the belief still held by most
   Protestants that marriage is an institution ordained by God. During
   the Reformation, the character of marriage began to be viewed as a
   covenant rather than a contract. This covenant relationship thus
   mirrors the relationship between God and Israel to become partners in
   a relationship marked by trust, fidelity, steadfast love, justice, and
   obedience to the will of God (Yates 1985, 42).
   <p>A recent editorial in Christianity Today noted that in modern times
   the increasing privatization of marriage has become almost absolute:
   neither the community nor the paterfamilias (does such exist anymore?)
   has any say in the formation or dissolution of a marriage. What was a
   community affair for over 400 years has devolved into just one more
   exercise of personal choice (Editorial 2000, 40). This same article
   decries attempts to promote gay marriages as a threat by judicial
   activism and gay-rights activists working together to empty marriage
   of its traditional meaning (Editorial 2000, 40). However, these
   representative arguments against gay marriages fail to explain in any
   substance how allowing gay marriages would in any way change the
   nature or understanding of heterosexual marriages. They fail to
   explain how allowing same-sex couples to become partners in a
   relationship marked by trust, fidelity, steadfast love, justice, and
   obedience to the will of God (Yates 1985, 42) would prevent
   heterosexuals from access to those same rights and responsibilities.
   Nor does it suggest how gay marriage would remove such connotations
   from the institution of marriage as understood by the church.
   <p>Others have argued that marriage and the family are valuable social
   institutions, especially important for children, but that they need to
   be newly understood in nonpatriarchal and egalitarian waysmarital love
   reflects God's own triune relationality. Marriage is an opportunity to
   experience the reality of the divine. Marriage is an opportunity to
   experience the reality of the divine (Wall 2000, 1120). A fresh
   interpretation of the theology of marriage should thus strive to
   liberate children from the widespread and often unacknowledged
   suffering caused by modernitys culture of divorce (Wall 2000, 1121).
   <p>The traditional emphasis on procreation within marriage and the belief
   that the sacrament of marital love finds its further expression in
   parents love for the fruits of their sexuality (Wall 2000, 1120) might
   seem to exclude homosexuals from the marriage rites, since homosexual
   acts can never produce offspring. Yet the vast majority of current
   churches make no outcry of damnation against childless couples, even
   if couples remain childless by choice. The church sees married couples
   that participate in the possibility of procreation by adoption or
   artificial insemination as equally valid parents to those who have
   their own biological children. Childless couples are still seen to
   embody this procreative possibility of their marriage by being
   involved in the support of other peoples children, or even in the
   support of the communities that foster the development of future
   generations. The church has failed to adequately explain how childless
   homosexual couples should not be allowed to marry on the basis of
   infertility, when the same rules do not apply to heterosexuals. Nor do
   they explain how homosexuals who become parents via adoption or other
   means would be incapable of participating in the procreative nature of
   marriage.
   <p>It should be noted that even the most steadfast opponents to gay
   marriage on the grounds that marriage is a holy sacrament allow that
   there is a civil component of marriage that is separate from the
   constraints of church doctrine. Many clergy refuse to marry couples
   unless both parties are committed Christians. The Catholic Church
   refuses to recognize a second marriage of someone who has divorced his
   or her first spouse. Some churches refuse to include marriage vows
   calling for the wife to obey her husband, yet other churches consider
   this vow a fundamental component of the ceremony. Yet none of these
   churches fight to make these restrictions and requirements part of the
   common law of the land. Allowing the state to sanction gay marriages
   would still leave individual churches the freedom to refuse to perform
   gay marriages on the basis of their own beliefs.
   Many of the proponents of gay marriage in the current political sphere
   argue from the basis of civil rights. They argue that homosexuals
   should have the same right to marriage that heterosexuals do. This may
   be the case, but perhaps this argument is incomplete, and does not
   fully counter the arguments against gay marriage as an attack on the
   sanctity of marriage. Perhaps the church needs to be a prophetic voice
   that calls for a deeper commitment by all people, heterosexual or
   otherwise, to the spiritual aspects of marriage. The church can and
   should support and nurture marriages based on Christian principals of
   love, trust, honesty, commitment and faith in God. The church should
   be the institution leading society to a more just understanding that
   the promotion of Christ-centered marriages does not have to exclude
   homosexuals from the equation. Indeed, the very existence of committed
   Christian, monogamous, married homosexual couples within the community
   can nurture the next generation of homosexual youth. Married gay
   couples within the church can affirm to young people that it is
   possible to be who and what God made them to be, and still be in deep
   communion with God and with community. It can also provide the next
   generation with a model for moral, Godly homosexual behavior.
