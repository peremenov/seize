     <p>Please note that more info on all these ships can be found in the
                          alphabetical ship lists.

   <p>Sent to me by a visitor to my website, Christoffer Hannevig, the
   grandson of Hans Hannevig (owner of M/T Irania). He and his brother
   Thor Daniel have done extensive research on these ships, and have
   compiled this information. More information on the majority of these
   vessels can be found under their respective letters of the alphabet on
   my Merchant Fleet pages.

   <p>Information from a PM by Berger of Nortraship's home fleet department
   dated 7th May 1947. Additional information (by C. Hannevig) included
   in Italics. My own comments and additions will be in green italics.

   <p>Post War - the owners of the above nine ships were put on notice of
   prosecution according to para 7 of the provisional order of May
   18-1940. Hans Hannevig was the only person to be prosecuted. The
   report sent to London by Smith in the Norwegian Legation in Stockholm
   referred the vessels sailing according to orders from the owners. The
   Swedish foreign office files records an interveiw with Smith on the
   same day as the above report being sent to London, that the legation
   had allowed the vessels to sail on account of the need for fuel oil
   for the fishing fleet (see C. Hannevigs mail at the end of this page).

   <p>NOTE: Paragraph 7 in the Provisional Order of May 18-1940 says that
   failure to abide by the rules of the order is punishable by
   imprisonment for up to a year, or fines up to onehundredthousand Norw.
   Kr., or both, if the case does not already merit heavier punishment.
   The same goes for those who contribute to such failure. Also, the
   ship, or the value of the ship could be subject to confiscation for
   the benefit of the State.
   <p>39. Kora* - Bergenske Dampskibsselskab, Legation gave permission to
   sail to Norway. 817 gt. Released July 15-1940.
   <p>40. Eastern Foam - Very small vessel, permission to sail to Norway.
   Left in May-1940. This vessel was only 48 gt and would not have been
   covered by the provisional decree of Apr. 22, which only included
   ships over 500 gt. (See my page "Nortraship"). However, the
   provisional decree of May 18 also covered smaller ships.
   <p>41. Resolut - Hjalmar A. H. Wiik, Bergen. 194 gt, permission from
   Nortraship to sail to Norway. Relased July 6-1940.
   <p>42. Leonard III - Fredrik Olsen. Returned to Norway in May. 110 gt,
   would not have been covered by the provisional decree of Apr. 22-1940.
   <p>The above 13 vessels returned to Norway under differing circumstances,
   but to quote the Skipsfartsdirektør Lars Usterud Svendsen "As the
   situatuon was at the time, I consider it to be in conformity with
   responsible authorities' attitude and in Norwegian interests that such
   ships were brought home from Sweden".

   <p>Christoffer Hannevig adds in an e-mail to me:
   <p>"The reason that the tankers were put into service with the
   co-operation of the Norwegian authorities in Stockholm is that the
   issue of these tank ships had been raised prior to the Invasion of
   Norway. Correspondence shows that the five largest oil companies were
   mandated by the Government to maintain strategic reserves, and in
   response they wrote to the supply department requesting assistance in
   chartering tonnage, this being on account of fact there was a shortage
   because of the Tonnage agreement with the UK.

   <p>Director Lind of Østlandske and officials from the supply department
   in Oslo travelled to Berlin in early August 1940 and purchased oil
   from Romania which was then transferred by rail to Stettin. The
   Shipsfartsdirectorate in Oslo took Irania, Borgny and Inger Johanne on
   timecharter and they then arranged voyage charters with Østlandske to
   bring the oil back to Norway. The reason given for the release of the
   tankers, by Smith of the Norwegian Legation when in discussion with
   Swedish Foreign Office, was that they had allowed the tankers to
   depart on account of the need for oil for the fishing Fleet. It should
   be noted that at time the tankers were returned a number of other
   vessels were issued with time charters by the Shipsfartsdirectorate in
   Oslo, that none of these vessels departed shows the control that the
   Legation had over the vessels. The case of the nine coal burners bear
   this hypothesis out also.

   <p>The ships that returned to Norway in August 1940 came home to Norway,
   with the agreement of the legation and were vetted on an individual
   basis the Norwegian Ministers in Stockholm. Each vessel had a charter
   arranged by the Shipsfartsdirectorate. These vessels were returned
   according to what was legal at that time. The fact that the Germans
   took control of the vessels in January 1941 is irrelevant to the
   process under which the tankers were permitted to return to Norway.

   <p>Regarding the nine coal burners the Norwegian Legation had requested
   the Swedish Foreign office to inform the Germans that the Ships were
   free to leave Sweden. The British exerted extreme pressure to prevent
   the departure of these vessels".
