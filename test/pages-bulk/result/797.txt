   <p>Red state or blue, north or south, voters around the country found at
   least one thing they could agree on yesterday as proposals banning
   same-sex marriage were winning in all 11 states where the issue
   appeared on the ballot.

   <p>Tallies from Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan, Mississippi,
   Montana, Ohio, Oklahoma, North Dakota and Utah showed constitutional
   amendments restricting marriage to a man and woman would pass by
   substantial margins. A similar measure in Oregon enjoyed a solid lead
   with nearly three-quarters of the votes counted.

   <p>Gary Bauer, director of the conservative group American Values, said
   the results on same-sex marriage proposals "tell us that the American
   people know exactly where they stand on this question, and it doesn't
   matter whether it's a Bush state or a Kerry state."

   <p>But social conservatives were on the losing end of the vote in
   California, where voters agreed to create a $3 billion fund to finance
   research on embryonic stem cells, circumventing federal limits imposed
   by President Bush.

   <p>Voters in three other states were headed toward approving new funds
   dedicated to health care programs, in each case by imposing hefty tax
   increases on tobacco. Montanans agreed to raise the tax on a pack of
   cigarettes by $1; an increase of 64 cents per pack was leading in
   Colorado, and Oklahoma voters approved a 55-cent tax hike.

   <p>In a result that could spark anti-immigration proposals in other
   states, Arizona voters appeared to be backing a measure that would
   require public officials to turn in illegal immigrants who seek public
   services, including police or fire calls. Supporters of the proposal
   said they want to see the idea carried to other states.

   <p>In Colorado, voters rejected a plan that would have divided the
   state's nine electoral votes in proportion to the popular vote in
   presidential elections. Supporters had called the move a step toward
   eliminating the electoral college nationally; opponents argued that
   dividing the state's vote would prompt presidential candidates to
   ignore Colorado altogether. Colorado Republicans, expecting Bush to
   carry the state, led the opposition to the proposal.

   <p>Montana voters approved the use of marijuana there for medical
   reasons, even though Bush had dispatched his drug czar to campaign
   against the measure. But a measure to further loosen marijuana
   controls in Oregon was losing, and Alaskans appeared to defeat a
   proposal that would have decriminalized marijuana possession.

   <p>Floridians approved a cap on damage awards in medical malpractice
   lawsuits. A similar proposal was leading in Nevada, but the vote on
   malpractice damage caps was extremely close in Oregon and Wyoming.

   <p>Florida voters also approved a measure that will allow the legislature
   to require parental notice before an abortion can be performed on
   girls younger than 18. Courts previously voided parental-notice laws,
   but the ballot measure passed yesterday changes the state constitution
   and would allow the legislature to approve the law.

   <p>Floridians approved a measure to raise the minimum wage to $6.15, a
   dollar above the federal minimum wage. Nevadans were also voting on a
   minimum-wage increase.

   <p>Oklahomans agreed to create a state lottery, leaving nine states that
   do not use this form of gambling to raise revenue. But gambling
   proposals struck out elsewhere. Californians appeared to reject
   proposals to allow more slot machines and casinos, Michigan voters
   tightened requirements to open casinos there, and Nebraskans
   resoundingly rejected an initiative that would have permitted Las
   Vegas-style casinos on the plains.

   <p>A proposal before California voters to ease the three-strikes law that
   mandates a lengthy prison term for a third felony conviction was
   closely contested with about half the voted counted.

   <p>The election offered more than 160 ballot issues to voters in 34
   states yesterday. That was a decline from the 2002 election, when
   ballots in 40 states listed 202 initiatives and referenda. The
   decrease reflected, in part, efforts by several state legislatures to
   make it more difficult for voters to qualify initiative proposals for
   the ballot.
