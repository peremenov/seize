<h>Debate Leads to Shifts in Strategy

<h>Advisers Predict Tightening Race

   <p>A newly energized battle for the White House heads into a crucial
   two-week period with John F. Kerry planning to capitalize on the
   momentum from a strong debate performance by shifting the focus to
   President Bush's economic record, while the president revives his
   attack on Kerry's foreign policy credentials, according to officials
   with both campaigns.

   <p>Thursday's debate produced a dramatic psychological shift in the
   presidential race, but strategists said it is less clear how much
   impact the 90-minute encounter would have on a lead that Bush has
   enjoyed since his convention in New York a month ago.

   

   <p>Yesterday found the candidates in the nation's two most important
   battlegrounds, with Bush campaigning in Ohio and Kerry rallying
   supporters in Florida. Bush hammered Kerry as someone who would turn
   over decisions about the use of U.S. military power to other
   countries, and Kerry said middle-class Americans cannot afford another
   four years of a Bush administration.

   <p>Bush advisers were described as stunned by how negative the reviews
   were of the president's performance, which many of them regarded as
   not his best but not so bad. Bush was portrayed as upbeat while
   acknowledging to supporters that he knew he could have done better.
   His aides indicated they plan some retooling before Friday's debate,
   but they maintained a sense of outward confidence.

   <p>Advisers to both candidates predicted that the race would tighten when
   the debates end on Oct. 13, if not before, but Bush strategists say
   that will have less to do with the debates than on a natural
   tightening as the election nears. The first poll since Thursday night
   to measure the debate's impact, taken by Newsweek, showed Kerry
   leading Bush 49 percent to 46 percent -- a reversal from a series of
   polls over the past month.

   <p>On Tuesday, Vice President Cheney and Democratic vice presidential
   nominee John Edwards will meet in Cleveland for a 90-minute debate --
   a session some Republicans believe may have more relevance as a result
   of what happened in Florida. On Friday, Bush and Kerry will attend a
   town hall meeting with voters in St. Louis. The final presidential
   debate will take place in Tempe, Ariz., on Oct. 13.

   <p>Democratic and GOP strategists said both candidates face new
   challenges as a result of the first debate.

   <p>For Bush, the immediate objective is to wipe away impressions of that
   debate, in which he appeared annoyed and irritated by Kerry's
   criticism. But just as significant may be how well he passes the test
   of explaining why he believes his policies in Iraq are working at a
   time when conditions on the ground suggest that the insurgency is
   stronger than ever. The longer the focus is on Bush's record, these
   strategists said, the more trouble he may have.

   <p>Republicans said Bush must avoid debating Kerry on the details of
   micromanaging foreign policy and return to statements of principle
   with which most voters agree, from the threat of Saddam Hussein to the
   need to stay in Iraq. And, said one GOP strategist, Bush needs to keep
   reminding voters about Sept. 11, 2001, and the impact of the terrorist
   attacks on the country.

   <p>For Kerry, the test will be to translate a positive debate performance
   into sustained and consistent performance on the campaign trail,
   continuing to undo the damage Bush has inflicted on him as someone who
   lacks core convictions or clear positions, particularly on Iraq. The
   first debate may have helped, but even Democrats say that it was not
   enough to solve the problem. Beyond that, Democrats said, he must tie
   together his critiques of Bush's foreign and domestic records more
   effectively than he has so far.

   <p>The aftermath of the debate produced a strategic change for the Kerry
   campaign, which had used the two weeks before it to launch an argument
   about Bush's record in Iraq that was designed to take the pressure off
   Kerry's often-contradictory statements on the subject. Heading toward
   the final two debates that will dwell on domestic policy, Kerry
   advisers said they will use a big advertising buy to help put the
   focus on Bush's economic record.

   <p>Kerry strategist Tad Devine said voters want to know that the
   president can deal with Iraq and domestic needs at the same time and
   that Kerry would offer that assurance. "This represents a very
   aggressive move to the domestic agenda," Devine told reporters
   yesterday as he described a 15-state, $7.7 million ad buy.

   <p>Bush's team indicated they plan to stick to the strategy that has
   guided their campaign by redoubling efforts to portray Kerry as a
   flip-flopper. "While Senator Kerry was very articulate, I don't think
   he cleared up what voters believed to be a central flaw in his
   candidacy, which is that in response to very serious threats, his
   response is very often to vacillate with the politics of the moment,"
   Bush's campaign manager Ken Mehlman said.

   <p>Bush has seized on a statement the Massachusetts Democrat made in the
   debate that U.S. decisions to launch military action needed to meet a
   "global test" of acceptability among major allies, and the campaign
   launched a new TV ad on the same theme. Kerry immediately responded
   with an ad describing the charge as a willful distortion of Kerry's
   position.

   <p>Publicly, the Bush campaign team maintained a sense of confidence
   about the outcome of the election and argued that, despite Kerry's
   attractive appearance, Thursday's debate had provided openings they
   will exploit. They also said they believe any Kerry gains from the
   debate will prove to be transitory.

   <p>"I remember the swoon everybody was in at the time of their convention
   and immediately afterward, and it turned out to be missed opportunity
   for him and a great opportunity for us," White House senior adviser
   Karl Rove said yesterday.

   <p>Other Republicans were privately less optimistic about the race,
   fearing that Kerry's debate performance could erase much of the impact
   of months of Bush-Cheney ads portraying the Democratic nominee as a
   flip-flopper. They said they were surprised by Bush's lackluster
   performance, even granting that the president is not the most skilled
   of debaters.

   <p>Asked whether he worried that Bush was on the defensive over his
   record in Iraq, one GOP strategist said: "I'm far less worried about
   that than that we had [Kerry] firmly pinned down as a wishy-washy
   flip-flopper and that's now not nearly as pinned down as I wish it
   were." The strategist, who declined to be identified to speak freely
   about the president's campaign, indicated that the debates offer Bush
   the opportunity to drive home that argument decisively and that in the
   Coral Gables debate he failed to do so.

   <p>Kerry advisers and Democratic strategists said the debate provided
   them with much-needed momentum and marked a potential turning point
   that would take Kerry off the defensive and shift the focus onto Bush
   in an effort to capitalize on what polls show is continuing public
   disapproval of his policies in Iraq and at home.

   <p>"The Kerry campaign and the Democrats are very realistic in knowing
   they did not win the election Thursday night," strategist Anita Dunn
   said. "The Republicans were the only ones who thought they could win
   the election Thursday night."

   <p>Other Democratic strategists said the debate guarantees that Kerry
   will get a fresh look from some voters, but they noted that more work
   remains if he hopes to make the gains permanent. "I think he has
   opened people's eyes and ears to him, and in the next debates he still
   needs to take advantage of the opportunity," Democratic pollster
   Geoffrey Garin said. "But the opportunity is very, very real at this
   point."

   <p>Democrats said the sequence of debates may work to Kerry's advantage,
   since foreign policy and national security have been Bush's perceived
   strengths, and the Kerry campaign's new ad strategy underscores their
   confidence. But Bush advisers said they are prepared to go toe-to-toe
   with Kerry on those issues, saying Bush can win the debate over taxes
   and regulatory issues and can hold down Kerry's advantage on health
   care. "We feel comfortable debating on either turf," a Bush adviser
   said.

   <p>The real battle may still come over foreign policy, with Kerry
   advisers confident that the senator's performance in the debate
   demonstrated not only deep knowledge of foreign policy but the
   strength of someone voters would trust to be commander in chief.

   <p>Bush advisers, however, remain equally confident that voters already
   have come to the conclusion that, whatever their fears are about Iraq,
   they have more confidence in Bush as the one to lead the country in a
   war on terrorism.

   <p>"It's going to be more of a substantive slog, and there Kerry gave us
   some openings," Rove said. "This global test thing was very big. This
   was shorthand for all the questions people have about the guy."

   <p>Beyond the "global test" issue, another Bush adviser said they will
   challenge Kerry for suggesting that he has a workable plan to
   stabilize Iraq and get U.S. troops home. "The notion that Kerry is
   hanging his hopes on this plan opens up a whole new avenue of
   discussion," the adviser said. "What is Kerry's plan? What are the
   specifics? What nations does he think will join a colossal mistake? In
   the end, I don't think this is going to help Kerry at all."

   <p>Bush's campaign is banking on the fact that rarely has a single debate
   turned around an election, and they express confidence that, in a
   highly polarized electorate, many judgments about the candidates have
   been locked away. Kerry's team sees the debates as pivotal in
   regaining ground lost in the past two months, and the team believes
   Iraq and the domestic environment provide them with the ammunition to
   win the election.
