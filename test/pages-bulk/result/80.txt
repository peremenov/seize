 <h> Advance the Foundations of A Subject



<p>   Our knowledge of the logical and natural foundations of many field
   isslight, or at least dubious or imperfect. Certainly subjects
   differdrastically in the relative strength of their foundations, or in
   theapparent fundamentality of their concepts, methods,
   principles,theories, achievements, research, language, logic, etc.

 <p>  Ideonomy can compare the foundations of different disciplines
   todiscover analogies, differences, commonalities, interdependences,
   contradictions,redundancies, interpenetrations, convergences, common
   goals and needs,unities, etc. It can use these to suggest omissions,
   errors, commonopportunities for research or discovery, ways to
   redescribe the foundationsof one subject in terms of the foundations
   of another, reciprocal problemsand fallacies, equivalent principles
   and entities, joint ignorance, newtests and experiments, higher
   standards, useful priorities, strategiesof theory, etc.

<p>   It can suggest ways in which to combine or transform certain
   conceptsor dimensions so as to generate or define 'all' possible or
   important conceptsor things, or the spaces and manifolds thereof.
   Contained or implicit withinsuch sets, spaces, and manifolds may be
   concepts or other things that cansupplement or deepen the foundations
   of the subject to which they pertain.

 <p>  Moreover, examining or merely experiencing such enlarged
   perspectivesupon what is possible may lead to the realization that
   what has been takento be fundamental within a subject is not really
   fundamental; or at least,that the foundations--or supposed
   foundations--of the subject are not asfree of assumptions, problems,
   inelegant features, superfluous elements,discrepancies, idiosyncratic
   aspects, etc as has been thought.

 <p>  Since ideonomy seeks to discover all of those natural concepts,
   dimensions,representations, entities, phenomena, laws, principles,
   relationships,etc that are supremely universal, fundamental,
   important, essential,minimal, logical, generative, necessary,
   transcendental, and pantological,it is in a privileged position to
   advance the foundations of arbitraryfields.

 <p>  It is in fact a principal goal of ideonomy to make all sciences
   morescientific, and among the best ways of doing this are by
   rectifying, enlarging,and extending the foundations of these subjects.

 <p>  There is a hint that ideonomy may be on the verge of discovering
   someunsuspected category of being that is more fundamental than either
   ideasor things, or that transcends what is meant by both the "mental"
   and "physical''aspects of reality.

<p>   By placing all of the things and phenomena in a subject upon basic
   scales--asof duration, time, Population, importance, complexity, or
   entropy--ideonomycan call the mind's attention to what is only
   naturally the most and leastfundamental in a subject, to the way in
   which things derive their greateror lesser fundamentality from one
   another, to the direction in which thatwhich is truly or most
   fundamental is apt to be found, or to the propertiesthat fundamentals
   or foundations are likely to or must have.

 <p>  Knowledge or theory of the foundations of many subjects is impairedby
   a conscious or unconscious failure to identify, define,
   characterize,or emphasize the most fundamental, central, or final
   topic, concept, phenomenon,substance, law, entity, goal, or the like
   of the subject (or the set ofsuch things). Then again, the supreme
   topic or whatever may have some terribleunsolved problem or difficulty
   associated with it.

 <p>  Thus the supreme concern of physics is no longer clear, the arch
   concernof sociology is in dispute, the goal of psychology is in flux,
   the essentialnature or defining properties of life are unknown to the
   science of life(or to biology), and even the basic object of study of
   mathematics (itcannot be number, though the nature of number is an
   enigma in anycase), cosmology (what is the described or effable
   'universe' itselfa part of?), and ideonomy (ideas, as hinted above,
   may not be sufficientlyfundamental) is mysterious.

<p>   Ideonomy can be used to define concepts in new and ever more
   fundamentalways, and it has already been used to define life, or to
   reduce it to aset of ninety-two fundamental properties. The set of
   8,464 possible dyadiccombinations of the primary properties have
   demonstrated such extraordinaryinterest that they promise to
   revolutionize theoretical biology, somethingwhich at once illustrates
   the importance of clarifying fundamentals andsuggests that the traits
   that were used to define the phenomenon of "life"were indeed
   fundamental.

<p>   On the other hand, the same bit of ideonomic research also
   highlightedthe problems that plague all efforts to resolve
   fundamentals or to getat the genuine foundations of a subject; for it
   was found that the sameset of ninety-two basic properties of "life"
   have either analogs or exactequivalents in the supposedly inanimate
   phenomena of subjects other thanbiology. Thus forms or analogs of
   procreation, natural selection, and evolutioneither may or do exist in
   fields such as physical chemistry, geology, psychology,and cosmology.
   The implication may variously be that life is not limitedor peculiar
   to biology, that life must be otherwise defined or definedvia other
   properties, that the essential phenomena of biology should includemore
   than organisms, or that biology should be recast into a
   superscienceincorporating many other sciences or that--like
   mathematics--applies toall science.

<p>   An old way of advancing the foundations of a subject is by
   improving,formalizing, or axiomatizing its logic; and a new or just
   now emergingway, by giving the subject cognitive form, which means the
   form of thoughtitself. Ideonomy can help with both of these
   approaches, particularly inconjunction with computer software and
   hardware.

 <h>  Erect Frameworks For Thought

 <p>  To think about anything one needs some manner of conceptual
   framework,a schema upon which to hang ideas or in which to develop,
   interweave, andexperiment upon different concepts.

 <p>  Ideonomy, in effect, can enable such conceptual schemes,
   structures,and systems to be mass produced; it can widen their scope,
   diversify them,enhance their power, increase their connectivity or
   interrelatedness, greatentheir mobility within and between fields,
   enlarge their rationality ormake their logic more explicit, give the
   individual the power to freelymanipulate them, etc.

 <p>  The concept of mental frameworks is so important to ideonomythat it
   needs to be expanded upon. By it we mean an open-ended set of
   :schemes, structures, systems, and 'machines' of : ideas,
   relations,principles, presuppositions, facts, arguments, thoughts,
   beliefs, values,purposes, perspectives, methods, strategies, gestalts,
   analyses, attitudes,percepts, images, definitions, explanations,
   dimensions, symbols, criteria,representations, models, heuristics,
   postulates, generalizations, theories,procedures, wisdoms, stories,
   memories, analogies, rules, mental associations,etc : serving or for
   furthering thought.

 <p>  Such mental schematizations of: experience, the environment,reality,
   behavior, human existence, or possibility : can be : consciousor
   unconscious : formal or informal : specific, general, or universal
   adhoc or perpetual (evolutionary) : deductive or inductive :
   empiricalor theoretical : categorical or experimental : developing or
   inert : etc.

 <p>  The diverse values and uses of cognitive frameworks include:mental
   simplification; clustering, grouping, and classifying of ideas
   andfacts; explication and coordination of different purposes and
   goals; structuringof memories in hierarchies, series, networks, trees,
   vergences, rings orcycles, foliations, meta-stories, etc-that are
   especially dynamic, powerful,natural, efficient, dense, optimal, etc;
   recursive, self-developing, nucleative,and self-correcting properties
   or effects; the multidimensional mentalparallax given by a
   multitude-of such frameworks; provision of a stableapparatus for
   developing and maintaining mental skills; standardizationwithin the
   mind (Ãƒ  la worldwide industrial and scientificstandardization);
   provision of bases for tests, evaluations, investigations,and
   experiments; limitation of thought to what is necessary and
   obviationof trivial and repetitive thought and creativity; bases for
   communicationamong different minds and for comparisons of their
   contents; enabling ofmore precise and rigorous thought; codification
   of though! accelerationof thought; enabling of overviews of
   experience, the world, one's conduct,and the mind; greater mental
   flexibility and self-control; readier learning;quick or more powerful
   structuring of materials, subjects, problems, orsituations; automation
   of mental habits and of ideation; heightened clarityof mind; etc.

 <p>  Frameworks for thought can enable a topic to be taught, mastered,
   ortreated more deeply or completely. They can provide clues for
   probing thenature of a thing. They can enable more imaginative or less
   prejudicedthought. They can help one to prepare for a more serious
   intellectual endeavor.They can help one relate one perspective to
   another, or permit one to graspa new thing by analogy to an old or
   familiar thing.

 <h>  Enumerate the Functions ofA Thing

 <p>  Things may, and usually do, have far more numerous and diverse
   functions,roles, and importances than people realize or would even
   imagine. Ifthis is true, it has great significance:

 <p>  Features of our world may be carelessly eliminated or altered by
   theignorant march of progress or change; All existing things may have
   a webof ecological relationships that merit study and respect; Things
   may allbe beneficiaries of many more things than has been thought;
   There may bean unsuspectedly great number of ways to change and
   improve the world orits things; etc.

 <p>  Among the possible generic functions of things are:
   Mediation;Prevention; Protection; Connection; Transportation;
   Communication; Symbolization;Testing; Facilitation; Amplification;
   Imitation or substitution; Extension;Generalization; Specialization;
   Correction; Improvement; Balancing; Sublimationor domestication;
   Counteraction; Elimination; Supplementation;
   Complementation;Exploitation; Coping; Hiding or deception; Showing;
   Production; Concentrationor confinement; Combination or integration;
   Separation, division, or liberation;Ordering; Maintenance or supply;
   Storage, holding, preservation, or conservation;Preparation;
   Initiation; Control or management; Adjustment or
   modulation;Transcendence, circumvention, or obviation; Orientation;
   Reduction or economization(enhancement of efficiency); Transformation;
   Etc.

 <h>  Ideonomy can help answer such questions about functions as:

 <l>  How do functions overlap?

 <l>  What functions are competitive? What functions are cooperative,
   complementary,or synergistic?

 <l>  What functions are illusory, misleading, or ambiguous?

 <l>  What are all of the degrees of functions of things? What are the
   maximal,minimal, and optimal functions of things? What are all of the
   intermediatefunctions of things?

<l>   What functions are absolute or relative? What makes them absolute
   orrelative? What are all of the ways in which they are absolute and
   relative?What are all of the absolute and relative functions of a
   thing?

 <l>  What functions conflict with, contradict, or negate what other
   functions?

<l>   How do things acquire--and lose--their functions? How do or could
   functionsoriginate, develop, evolve, diminish, or disappear?

 <l>  How do different functions compare? What are all of the ways of
   comparingall functions? What functions are identical, equivalent,
   analogous, orrelated to what other functions? What functions differ or
   diverge from,or are opposite to, what other functions? What are all of
   the degrees,bases, circumstances, and implications of these things?

 <l>  What are not the functions of things, and what functions do not
   existor are impossible?

 <l>  What are all of the generic and specific : properties, dimensions,
   elements,mechanisms, effects, signs, manifestations, criteria, etc of
   allgeneric and specific functions?
   What functions are arbitrary or necessary? What functions are
   artificialor natural? What are the degrees and causes of these things?

<l>   How can the: prediction, classification, recognition,
   examination,evaluation, explanation, creation, development,
   application or use, intercorrelation,synthesis, differentiation,
   description, definition, modification, controlor government, etc : of
   the functions of arbitrary things be mechanizedand automated in the
   future, when the needed technology and methodologyemerges7

<l>   How can different functions, and different species and genera of
   functions,be combined to synthesize novel, desirable, or arbitrary
   functions--orsystems of functions--or to enlarge, transform, or
   relocate old functions?

 <l>  What functions of familiar or known things have been
   neglected,forgotten about, or overlooked? What are the idiosyncrasies
   of theways in which people in general, or certain groups of people,
   classify,perceive, rank, or utilize the classes of functions of
   classes of things?What is good, bad, or simply significant about these
   idiosyncrasies?

 <l>  What are the characteristic and comparative ratios of our
   ignoranceabout to our knowledge about different (key or comprehensive)
   functionsof different (key or comprehensive) things in different (key
   or comprehensive)situations?

 <l>  What are all possible or important categories of ignorance and
   knowledgeabout functions? What are the actual extent, qualities, and
   forms of ourignorance, knowledge, and skills within each of these
   vergent categories?What are the total-known or hypothesizable--costs,
   values, consequences,and implications thereof?

<l>   In what meta-structures: series, networks, hierarchies,
   trees,lattices, rings, circuitries, vergences, knots, line-clumps,
   'crystals'(e.g. of intersecting hyperdimensional planes or curved
   surfaces), plexures,'soils', matrixes, clusters, 'blobs', conoids,
   helicoids, aegagropilasor Peano curves, 'onions', fractals, chaoses,
   paths, 'catastrophes', tessellationsor 'jigsaw puzzles', topological
   monsters, etc : do or could functions: exist, originate, operate,
   interact, develop, metamorphose, vanish, combine,coalesce, reproduce,
   cooriginate, coevolve, invert, exhibit singularities,etc?

  <l> How do such meta-structures themselves: behave, associate,
   interact,evolve, originate, function, etc?

 <l>  How could or must the meta-structures of functions be used to
   describe,explain, discover, manipulate, create, alter, etc :
   particular or arbitraryfunctions?

 <l>  What are all the particular or recurrent : goods, bads,
   defects,imperfections, limitations, etc.: of all functions of all
   things?

 <l>  What are all known or possible functions of a single, particular
   orrandom, thing--and how are they structured inter se?

<l>   Conversely, what are all of the actual or possible things that haveor
   could have a single, random or specific, function? What do they haveor
   not have in common, that explains or relates to their shared
   function--orthat does not do so?

 <l>  What are all of the self-functions of things?

 <l>  What set of questions should be asked when treating functions? How
   shouldthey be ranked in relative importance? In what order should they
   be asked-orset of orders, depending on particular circumstances? What
   explains theirdiverse importance? Which of these questions are and are
   not currentlyasked; or how efficient is the asking and answering of
   these questions?What decision-tree should govern the use of these
   questions, and what areits proper and possible anastomoses? What are
   the ways in which some ofthe questions can and should be iterated?

 <l>  As results piled up worldwide from the habitual, ubiquitous, and
   standardizeduse of such an encyclopedic, all-purpose, or universal
   questionary, howcould they be systematically and efficiently compiled,
   collated, colligated,promulgated, and exploited?

 <p>  Illustrative examples of functions include the function or
   functionsof: Telephones in creating commercial nexuses; Human
   skinmicroflora in (hypothetically) preempting sites upon which
   pathogenscan establish themselves and from which the pathogens can
   invade the macrosymbionticbody; Ball bearings in minimizing frictional

   seismoceptiveoccupants of the approach of more funambulatory enemies;
   Cloud coverin regulating terrestrial insolation and Earth's

   ordiminished; Multiplied and diversified-or the reverse; Created or or
   ended;Broadened or narrowed; Sophisticated or simplified; Connected or
   disconnected;Integrated or unified; Differentiated within or from

   Perpetuated; Perfected; Fixed (frozen); Slowed or quickened;Elevated
   or reduced in importance -or made central or peripheral;
   Modulated;Etc.

  <h> Foster Wisdom About the Future

 <p>  There are many ways in which one could be wise or wiser about
   thefuture; e.g. one could simply attend to it more closely,
   orappreciate better the fleeting nature of the present or of things as
   theynow are; one could systematically examine the range of future
   possibilities;one could visualize the various alternative courses the
   world mighttake in the future, and the things apt to determine
   whichparticular set of courses the world will actually follow; one
   could identifythe world's needs in advancing into the future, and
   endeavor toprovide for those needs and wants; one could help to
   educateall present and future humanity to deal with the future; one
   could attemptto influence the actual course the world will take
   tomorrow, orto push it toward what would be good and away from what
   would be evil orinferior; one could labor to produce general methods
   for foreseeingor altering the future; etc.

 <p>  Of course the future being referred to need not be that of the worldas
   a whole or represented by the future in its entirety, but on the
   contrarymight be arbitrarily modest: one's own future lifetime,
   perhaps, or tomorrow'sevents or the events of the next minute, or the
   momentary or instantaneousoutcome of a scientific experiment that
   someone is performing or whoseperformance is simply being
   contemplated.

 <p>  Becoming wiser about the future might mean nothing more than
   divestingoneself of prejudicial ideas, attitudes, beliefs, or world
   views, becomingfriendlier--or more hostile--to innovation, reducing
   the irrational inertiaof institutions, or paying more attention to the
   patterns and lessons ofhistory that might be analogous or relevant to
   the future.

  <p> Among the fallacies that diminish wisdom about the future, and
   thatideonomy could help to combat, are that: the future will simply
   repeatthe past; the course of the future is predetermined and
   inalterable; theworld of the present represents the best of all
   possible worlds; humanknowledge and wisdom are nearly complete and
   perfect--and our ignorancesmall and unimportant; the future is too
   complex or esoteric for us toanticipate its character or
   possibilities--and past failures and inabilityto correctly foresee the
   future were unavoidable, and should be lookedupon as a warning that
   all prophecy is folly; etc.

 <p>  Ideonomy could be used to: devise new, or suggest all possible,methods
   for studying future possibilities; survey, describe, compare,
   evaluate,criticize, correct, extend, integrate, and transcend all past
   and presentprophetic methods, endeavors, and results; identify the
   totality of thingsthat can or should have their future possibilities
   considered; predictthe future interrelationships and interactions of
   these things; indicatethe future's most fundamental dimensions,
   structure, forces, elements,patterns, laws, etc; formulate principles
   for treating the future; developnovel means for representing and
   dramatizing the future's possibilities(e.g. diagrams, organons,
   computer software and simulations new types ofbooks, special language
   and idea spaces, artificial intelligence programs,etc); suggest all
   possible causes, effects, and conditions of future possibilities;rank
   the relative and absolute probability and importance of all
   futurepossibilities; indicate the different roles and functions that
   things areapt to have in the future; and so forth.

 <p>  Some of the specific questions and other issues that ideonomy
   couldhelp to address are: What should be maximized and minimized in
   thefuture? What new rights may become political issues in the future?
   Whathuman freedoms must ultimately be restrained for the good of all?
   Whatpresent concerns of government will be retired and what new
   concerns willtake their place? What means are there for maximizing the
   future diversityand complexity of civilization? What were the laws of
   history, insofaras they apply to the future as well? How ambiguous is
   the future or areits possibilities? What meta-structures are
   applicable to the study ofthe future or will actually describe its
   possibilities: incl. chains, series,trees, networks, hierarchies,
   vergences, etc? What elements of the presentwill disappear or endure
   in the future? What new discoveries, inventions,creations, and other
   innovations are possible, probable, or certain inthe future? What
   developments can continue ad infinitum and whichmust have limits? In
   what ways is the future apt to surprise us? What areall the future
   possibilities of a single, random or particular, thing?What future
   possibilities would be synergistic or antagonistic? In whatorder must
   different things happen?

 <p>  Illustrative examples of specific future possibilities are:
   Eliminationof the need for sleep; Chinese democratic revolution; Life
   discovered elsewherein the cosmos; Legalization of prostitution;
   Replacement of stores by teleshoppingand robotized delivery of goods
   to homes; Evolution of a single panhumanlanguage; Reduction of physics
   to 'pure' logic; New age of dirigibles;Exploration of a single cave
   'pushed' to 100,000 kilometers (using miniaturehumanoid
   teleoperators); Mechanical pets and computer- simulated plantsmore
   popular than biological organisms; Family car replaced by a
   flyingequivalent; irrefutable scientific proof of the existence of
   'God'; Temporalmetric system adopted; War fought using beams of
   elementary particles soexotic that they have not yet been imagined;
   Time's apparently unique andirreversible flow shown to be a physical
   illusion; Mining of Earth's mantle;Every organism on Earth transformed
   into a different species; New humansexes added to the traditional two;
   Complete obsolescence of the family;Lamps made to last centuries;
   immortality made compulsory; Ethics remadeinto an exact science;
   Deliberate suicide of the human race, subjectivelyrendered irrelevant
   by its own transhuman mechanical creations; Ideonomytaught at all
   grade levels in all schools; War everywhere ended by theintroduction
   of "peace pills" (irenic psychopharmaceuticals); Etc.

 <h>  Generalize Notions

 <p>  One can use ideonomy to help to generalize or even universalize anyand
   all notions and things.

 <p>  Over time things often prove to be insufficiently generalized. Thatis,
   the essential idea or set of ideas associated with them turn out
   tohave greater meaning, scope, or application than what is initially
   --orperhaps than is ever at any finite moment--thought to be the case.

 <p>  Actually it is probably true that in some sense the generality of
   allconcepts, and all concepts of things, must always be at once
   inadequateand excessive.

 <p>  But according to an ideonomic principle it is of the utmost
   importancethat the generality of all concepts constantly be enlarged
   over time, oradvanced toward infinity. Naturally in the course of such
   progressive generalizationthe concepts will undergo fundamental
   metamorphoses, yet a form of semanticcontinuity may be apparent in
   retrospect that was prospectively invisibleor even meaningless.

 <p>  It could be said that all concepts are inherently infinite in
   meaning,and even that this infinite aspect is close to their essence.

<p>  To generalize - according to the dictionary - is to make general
   reduceto general laws : give a general form to; to derive or induce (a
   generalconception or principle) from particulars; to derive or induce
   a generalconception, principle, or inference from; to make general (as
   by existentialor universal qualification) : render applicable to a
   wider class; to givegeneral applicability to; to modify or eliminate
   (nonessential details)for emphasizing some particular feature; to
   portray or emphasize generalrather than particular features and
   characteristics of.

<p>   Illustrative examples of generalizations of ideas and
   things:Historically, the generalization of the legal concept of a
   personto include corporations and other organizations, even though
   these containmany human beings; Energy has been generalized to include
   mass;Some quantum physicists would generalize the concept of a
   physical phenomenonto include the apparatus used to measure the
   phenomenon, the observer,or even the observational or mensurational
   act; A few physicists wouldgo even further, and define any phenomenon
   as perforce includingthe whole universe or all of spacetime; Certain
   modern composers generalizethe notion of musical scale to include any
   systematic or recurrentarrangement of notes on which a composition is
   based; The concept of intelligencehas been generalized to include
   animals that were formerly regarded asmindless; Skeletal and muscular
   systems have been generalized toinclude the cytoskeleton and other
   purely intracellular systems and structures;Analogous generalization
   of the nervous system to include equivalentsin unicellular
   organisms--and perhaps plants--may be imminent; Conceptsof star and
   galaxy should perhaps be generalized to include oneanother--since
   stars (as superstars) may equal or exceed (dwarf) galaxiesin size; The
   progressive generalization of the concept of number in thehistory of
   mathematics to ever more abstract, strange ' numerous, and
   'lessnumber-like' things (imaginary numbers being one of the more
   famous productsof this process); Over history the concept of evolution
   has becomeever more generalized--to embrace not only biology (life;
   the phylogenyof species, ontogeny of bionts, and life-long
   biosynthesis of molecules,organelles, etc) but geology (Earth and
   other planets; the evolution ofcontinents, mountains, geospheres,
   etc), astronomy (stars, galaxies perhaps,and the universe as a whole),
   physics (matter, energy, space, time, physicallaws and constants
   perhaps, etc), society, industry, economies, the mind,ethics, the
   arts, etc; Mental illness has been generalized to includenormal mental
   states and individuals (on the belief that the differenceis only one
   of degree, perspective, or concern)--and mental normalityhas been
   generalized to include mental illness (e.g. based on the beliefthat
   the latter may be rational, coherent, or productive when viewed
   internally,from a different or larger perspective, or with an
   awareness that societyis universally illogical and insane); Learning
   might be generalizedto include selective forgetting, unlearning, and
   progressive inhibition;The concepts of publishing, book, and magazine
   can be generalizedto include novel forms and products of electronic
   publishing; The conceptof color might be generalized to include the
   static and dynamicmeanings of pseudocolors in different or all
   possible situations--or simplyto perceptual and cognitive patterns
   apparent in temporal successionsand combinations of regular colors;
   Over the course of history theconcept or subject of science has
   broadened unremittingly, to the extentthat it now includes the study
   of: art qua aesthetics, musicology,philology, etc.; money, wealth, and
   economic systems qua economics;governments and governance qua
   political science; reasoning andintelligence qua logic and cognitive
   science; battle and peace quamilitary science; techniques and
   engineering qua technology; society qua sociology; historyqua
   historiology; the psyche qua psychology; ideas quaideonomy;
   administration qua management science; language and languagesqua
   linguistics; forms qua morphology; chance quastochastics; science
   itself qua metascience; farming quaagriculture; etc; Etc.

 <h>  Examples of things that may have been inadequately generalized orthat
   may be generalized in the future:

 <p>  Humor: If precursors, rudiments', theriomorphic variants, oranalogs of
   laughter or a risibles are eventually found in animals otherthan man,
   generalization of the concept or phenomenon of humor (its
   origin,functions, mechanisms, types, properties, referents, states,
   logics, degrees,scope, etc) may turn out to be desirable or necessary;

<p>   Machine: The concept of a machine may have to be generalizedso as to
   include biological phenomena (e.g. genomes, protein
   molecules,micelles, organelles, cells, organs, biochemical networks
   and processes,bodily macro- systems such as the nervous and immune
   systems, organisms,ecosystems, and the hypothetically Gaian bios),
   various phenomena and entitiesin pure and applied mathematics--or even
   logic, chemical reactions, crystals,diversely intelligent computers;
   models, simulations, and even scientifictheories; human languages and
   computer programs; geological and meteorologicalphenomena such as
   volcanoes and storms, the 'universe', man's mind or society,pure or
   real-world ideas, physical laws, statistical and quantum phenomenain
   physics, economic systems, political ideologies, ethical systems,
   andsymphonies;

 <p>  Food: This should include 'nutritive' atmospheric gases;
   conceivablyorganisms get some genes or genic influences directly from
   food (via "lateralgene flow"); the body is forever 'consuming itself'
   (in strange and little-known senses); even inanimate phenomena 'eat'
   or require 'nutrition' fromtheir environment; conceivably the
   seemingly stable and self-existent macroscopicworld, with its
   delomorphic baryons and leptons, is in reality being
   dynamicallymaintained and replenished from below, or by chains,
   fountains, singularities,plexiform or vergent hierarchies, or the like
   ascending from the ultramicroscopiclevel of zero-point, Bore], Dirac-
   vacuum, Wheeler-prespace, or Bohm-implicateorder fluctuations; and the
   mind 'eats' ideas;

<p>   House: This concept should be generalized to include the diversehomes
   (-nests, burrows, cavities, interstices, webs, mounds, hollow
   trees,logs, host exteriors and interiors, atmospheric dust and cloud
   particles,etc) of all organisms; shells, exoskeletons, skin, bodies,
   the skull andblood-brain barrier, etc; cells, plasmalemmas, misc.
   membranes, etc; ecologicalniches, ecosystems, and the bios; as well as
   the 'houses' of inanimatephenomena: atmospheres, planets, the
   heliosphere, the galactic atmosphere,the universe, factories, etc;

  <p> Universe: Generalizing this terribly presumptuous concept mightbe
   appropriate if there are other universes or quasi-external parts ofour
   universe, Everett's Many-Worlds Cosmology is real, most of the massof
   the universe is invisible and exotic stuff, there is an infinite
   microcosm,Bohm's Implicate Order exists, etc; or to take account of
   Wheeler's Superspace,the omniverse (all of spacetime), physicomental
   "reality", and the Ideocosm.

   circumstances; andwhat are all of the psychodynamics thereof? What are
   the total ideonomicinterests of these things?

 <p>  What are the current frontiers of generalization of things bymankind?

 <h>  Suggest Goals

 <p>  Many enterprises are launched, conducted, and even consummated
   withalmost no attention paid to their possible, actual, or appropriate
   goals.

 <p>  Yet this can cause many problems and have many costs, e.g.:
   Inefficiency;Failure to make adequate or correct provision or
   preparation; Inabilityto notice and rectify a faulty course; Taking of
   excessive or unnecessaryrisks, perhaps unconsciously; Blindness to
   opportunities; Indecision andinaction in crises; Indirection and
   aimless wandering; Lack of plans andpriorities; Inability to optimize
   the use--and mindless wastage--of finiteresources; Anarchy;
   Distractibility; Inaction; Anomie and tedium; Lackof motivation;
   Inconsistencies, contradictions, and disharmonies; Impossibilityof
   cooperative endeavor; Inability to structure existence; Fragility ofan
   enterprise and a tendency for it to degenerate and fragment;
   Inabilityto discriminate good from bad--or to recognize what is best
   and worst,vital and unimportant, central and peripheral, significant
   and irrelevant,etc; Anonymity to the world at large or external
   confusion and misreaction;Etc.

  <p> Ideonomy can be used to suggest goals that are: new,
   alternative,contrasting, successional or progressive, maximal or
   optimal, safe, certain,transcendent or revolutionary, unconsidered or
   overlooked, realistic, easy,expedient, productive, ultimate or
   supreme, simpler or more complex, indirect,contingent, secondary or
   tertiary, suited to oneself, complementary tosituations or
   circumstances, compatible, synergistic, logical, less
   costly,multidimensional or multipurpose, subtle, definable,
   proportionate to one'sresources, unorthodox, contra-intuitive,
   irredundant, finite or infinite,equivalent or analogous, specific or
   general, universal, etc.

  <p> Goals are often pursued that are the wrong ones, but they are not
   abandonedbecause they have never been made explicit. When some goal is
   made explicitit becomes possible to study its real meaning and
   importance and the relationshipsit has to other things that are being
   done or that might be done. The thingsthat are required for the goal
   to be achieved can be investigated, decidedupon, and implemented.

  <p> Ideonomy by its nature encourages the comparative study of every
   sortof goal in every sort of field, and profitable knowledge can be
   derivedfrom this of the larger and more efficient ways and means of
   pursuing arbitraryor all goals. Mistakes that are apt to be made in
   selecting and achievinggoals can be identified, along with ways of
   avoiding those mistakes orof dealing with them when they occur.

   <p>Other characteristic problems that are associated with the pursuitof
   goals include an overdramatization of the importance of a singlegoal,
   token attention to the goal, a tendency for a goal to be
   misformulatedor misinterpreted, failure to appreciate that a goal is
   apt to be morethan a simple name or definition and may embrace the
   simple insights thatare apt to accrue in planning for and advancing
   toward the goal, the errorof relying upon a single method or path for
   achieving the goal, etc.

  <p> Illustrative examples of goals are: Putting the first men onthe Moon;
   Target in an enemy country of an intercontinental ballistic
   missile;Downing and eating of a gazelle as the goal of a lion that is
   stalkingit; Student's goal of passing an exam; Finding a needle in a
   haystack;Landing someone as one's spouse; Solving some great unsolved
   problem inmathematics, as by finding a proof of Fermat's last theorem;
   Breaking anOlympic record in poll vaulting; 'Pineapple's goal' of
   reaching the standardsize specified by the genome of the pineapple
   plant; Zinc atoms' 'goal'to deposit themselves on the cathode in the
   electrolysis of zinc chloridesolution; Break-even point in research to
   achieve controlled thermonuclearfusion for industry; 'Goal' of a
   column of magma ascending through Earth'scrust to reach the atmosphere
   and erupt lava on the Earth's surface; Goalof a company to recover its
   investment in developing a new product; Puppy'sgoal of reaching its
   mother's teat while fighting its littermates for thesame objective;
   Goal of a detective to discover the identity of a murderer;'Goal' of
   the disturbed surface of a pond to settle back into
   hydrostatic(gravitational) equilibrium; Etc.

  <p> Although the concept of a goal in the realm of inanimate nature is
   momentarilydiscountenanced, several fundamental questions are in fact
   begged by thisexclusion, and--certainly with revision--the concept may
   one day be beresurrected. At the very least it may be decided that the
   word shouldbe redefined so that it can function in this more embracive
   way, sincedead matter can be observed to behave in ways that by
   analogy suggestthe pursuit and satisfaction of goals by organisms or
   minds. The 'goal'may simply be the thermodynamic end-state of a
   physical process that isrelaxing toward equilibrium-regardless of
   whether that end-state is known,specifiable, or even meaningful in
   advance, or of whether it is uniquelyimplicit in some set of
   mathematical equations. It is also true that itis premature to
   absolutely exclude the possibility of teleological phenomenaor of
   "final causes" from physical nature. Excluded possibilities in
   sciencehave a funny way of reentering the picture years later in
   radically differentdress, although this is a lesson that scientists
   have been slow to learn.

 <h>  Show Paths To Goals

  <p>It is possible to know, or even to prove, that a goal is
   attainablewhile at the same time remaining ignorant of how to actually
   achieve it.Even if all of the necessary resources and methods are at
   one's disposal,a critical sequence of steps or concatenation of things
   may elude one.An objective may hover an instant, layer, cell,
   operation, or decisionaway and yet be impossible to reach simply
   because the path to it is notknown, well-defined, or available.

 <p>  Ideonomy can teach general and specific ways to discover or create
   pathsto specific and generic goals, and train the relevant skills.

  <p> It can also suggest: Whether a desired or imagined path existsor not
   or would or would not be feasible; Costs and requirements of
   finding,constructing, altering, or using paths; Things paths should
   avoid or theirgeneral hazards; Different types of paths that are
   possible or appropriate;Likely and proper quantitative dimensions of
   paths; Consequences or sideeffects of using different paths; Etc.

<h>   Clarify Good

 <p>  To clarify good it may be convenient, desirable, or necessary to
   firstor eventually consult, define, investigate, portray, or even
   create bad.Bads and goods are both primary concerns of ideonomy.

 <p>  Basic classes of goods are: Helps and assistance; 'Net goods';Virtues;
   Excellences; Benefits; Advantages; Ideals; Wishes and aims
   (desiredthings and conditions); Needed and useful resources; Good
   luck; Pleasuresand pleasurable things; and 'Non-bads' (absences of
   bad; everything thatis not actually bad).

<p>   The goods that interest ideonomy need not have anything to do with
   humanbeings or human values. Inanimate phenomena and entities--and
   'pure ideas',whatever they are--have their own agathokakological
   orders. Allgoods of all things should be inquired into, systematized,
   and reducedto ever more universal laws.

 <p>  How can good be served, maximized, and evolved if we are ignorant
   ofits kinds, possibilities, and laws? If we do not understand its
   complexities,problems, contradictions, and illusions? If its elements,
   fundamentals,needs, mechanisms, processes, and manifold relationships
   to the other thingsof the universe are unknown?

  <p> One way to begin the scientific study of good would be to examine
   thenature, circumstances, and existence of a single-random or
   particular-thingin an effort to discover all goods of or connected
   with the thing, or everyway and degree in which any or every thing is
   or is not 'good' for thething or 'from the thing's perspective'.

 <p>  Were the thing to be given such comprehensive agathological scrutinyan
   ant, for example, one might ask and try to answer these questions:
   Isthe presence of a minimum amount of water in the soil important to
   theant's hive? Which traces of chemical elements are good for the
   ant's diet,even though they are not essential nutrients? Are there
   diseasesof other soil organisms that benefit the ant when they occur?
   What polymorphismsare good or best for the species of ant? What wind
   velocity at the mouthof an ant's nest is optimal for the colony, in
   good weather? Are therecertain early life experiences that are good
   for an ant to have, say becausethey trigger the emergence of latent
   instincts, orient the ant for lifeto the peculiarities of its
   environment, or institute certain skills inthe then- plastic nervous
   system of the ant?

  <p> Lessons here could be carried over experimentally to the possible
   goodsfor other animal species. Discrepancies, adaptations, and
   supplementationsnoted through such series, networks, and hierarchies
   of comparisons couldlead to an even more powerful generalization of
   agathological knowledge,methods, and skills, and eventually make
   possible the treatment of arbitrarygoods of arbitrary things.

  <p> Another valuable ideonomic exercise would be to construct a
   diagramwith the names of a random set of related or maximally diverse
   things scatteredabout but enclosed in ellipses. Arrows would be drawn
   between certain ellipsesto indicate which things are or might be, in
   some sense or degree, goodfor which other things. Arrows could be:
   one-way or two-way, simpleor branched, connected only to ellipses or
   also referent to or from otherarrows (Ãƒ  la vergences, networks,
   circuitries, hierarchies,or other meta- structures), weighted by being
   thickened, colored to signifysenses of good or goodness, etc.

  <p> Complementary sets or suites of the diagram could be created to
   exhibitor investigate the difference that various arguments,
   circumstances,or perspectives make for the possible or actual
   relationships, incrementalbut rational and natural changes in various
   directions (e.g. that of scaledtime or probability), how different
   people would render the same diagram,etc.

  <p> Such an agathological diagram - or agathogram - could be programmedon
   a computer in a matric or dynamic form. Multivariate analysis,
   multidimensionalscaling, cluster analysis, artificial intelligence
   techniques and programs,etc could be used to discover and explore an
   agathological universe - oragathocosm - of : meaningful, contrasting,
   interdependent, orthogonal,nonexistent, evolutionary, anamorphic,
   circular, cyclic, autopoietic, mathematicallydiverse, arborescent,
   stochastic, chaotic, aesthetically appealing, "implicate"(in David
   Bohm's sense), etc : idea spaces, permutations, combinations,clusters,
   chains, series, "rotations", inversions, representations,
   games,systems of motions and transformations, morphogeneses, other
   types of ideograms,etc.

  <p> All of the : senses, categories, types, subtypes, taxons, andnatural
   taxological systems : of special or universal goods need tobe
   identified, described, named, evaluated, reduced to operations
   andlogic and transformations, etc. They should be used to :
   discover,imagine, investigate, characterize, compare, interrelate,
   synthesize, criticize,perfect, exploit, transcend, teach, etc all
   goods of all things.

  <p> What are all known or possible dimensions for scaling goods orthe
   goodness of things, and all actual scalings and co-scalings of
   allabstract and concrete goods, e.g. per: closeness, redundancy,
   co-representabilityor comparability, orthogonality, oppositeness,
   cost, frequency of exemplification,typological diversity, confinement
   to man (anthropomorphism) or contraryexemplification throughout
   nature, human importance, human agreement about,degree of clustering,
   logical containment or hierarchy, universal symmetry,conceptual
   simplicity, etc?

  <p> How does the same type of good vary when it is exemplified in
   differentphenomena or sciences?

  <p> What are all of the goods and bads that converge in and/or diverge
   fromsingle events?

 <p>  What transvaluations of goods, or of the goodness of things, are
   possible,desirable, or inevitable?

  <p> Some illustrative genera of good are: order, harmony,
   efficiency,simplicity, reliability, strength, success, improvement,
   wealth, balanceor proportion, security, freedom, opportunity, utility,
   diversity, transcendence,wisdom, power, control, productivity,
   flourishing, peace, 'health', problemlessness,salubrity, wholeness,
   meaning, challenge, consummation, certainty, purpose,direction,
   preservation, beauty, challenge, responsibility, 'fairness',good
   fortune, cleanliness, clarity, sophistication, assistance,
   synergism,truth, self-mastery, etc.

  <p> All causes of good need to be discovered, defined, distinguished,
   quantified,explained, synthesized, systematized, mastered
   (technologically and methodologically),etc. Yet the causes of both
   specific and generic goods are often esoteric.

  <p> Some possible or known causes of good are: one or more othergoods;
   universal laws and relationships; nature's pervasive or absoluteself-
   similarity; the subjectivity of 'goods' and the spatiotemporal
   invariancesof human minds; striving for good; plans; methods;
   cooperative and coevolutionarytendencies of natural phenomena;
   evolution--incl. self- evolution and cosmicevolution-of things and
   goods; the pervasive tendency of the universe toorder and organize
   itself; moral and legal laws; the sense of beauty; fractal,harmonic,
   hierarchic, vergent, cyclic, and other meta- patterns and
   meta-structures;man's habits of collecting, preserving, nursing, and
   combining goods orgood things; early agathology; etc.

 <p>  Some illustrative species or narrow examples of good are:
   humility,honesty, sanity, kindness, reverence, trust, stability,
   civilization, goodhabits, tolerance, gentleness, magnanimity,
   eloquence or mastery of language,longevity, altruism, grace,
   happiness., comfort, leisure, community, scientificand technological
   progress, economic growth, wit, family strength, quiet,nonpollution of
   the environment, learning, teaching, husbandry of humanresources,
   thrift, military peace, good government, manners, integrity,refinement
   of taste, and the doing of good.

  <p> Ideonomy might be used to investigate what is good for, in, about,or
   otherwise in connection with such diverse particular things as:soil,
   the family, enzymes, the human voice, an enemy, a friend, spiders,a
   spider's web, grape flavor, starlight, yard sales, religion,
   atheism,the Golgi apparatus (dictyosomes), war (sic), bads (sic),
   virtue, the crosswordpuzzle, seed dispersal, the honeybee waggle
   dance, filter feeding, Earth'swinds, cosmic gravity waves, binary star
   systems, beaches, time, Reynold'snumber (Re = rnL/h),the alga, earth
   tides, psychoanalytic transference, intelligence tests,oneself, the
   unconscious mind, heat diffusion, proton precession, striationsin
   electrical discharge, radioactivity, adjoint groups, paracompact
   space,exterior algebras of linear spaces, Fourier transforms, saddle
   points,overteaching, ring whizzers and other fluxional molecules,
   monomolecularfilms, certain choices of starting materials in
   chemistry, marine upwelling,the sea's internal waves, ocean spray, a
   falling birth rate, acculturation(intercultural borrowing), twinned
   crystals, the semicolon, taxation, theSwiss system of government,
   German character, boldness in war, militarynight operations,
   astronomy, historiographic periodization, goodwill incommerce,
   expressionist painting, the design of a safety pin, one
   person'shandwriting, leveraged buyouts, corporate disclosure, FM
   (frequency modulation)radio transmission, the gear, formal education,
   the metaphor, crying, touristryto the Third World, divinities, the
   universe, the mathematical point, play,birds' nests, the chair, the
   theater, the Dirac quantum mechanical vacuum,competition, philosophy,
   the pinna, examples, music, continental drift,ultramicrophysical
   strings, etc.

 <p>  The ideonomic treatment of good and bad can be pandisciplinary in
   twosenses: not only can ideonomy help to treat the content or
   phenomena ofall subjects, but it can at the same time be used to
   evaluate, criticize,and improve the work, organization, and structure
   of entire disciplines.

 <p>  Thus it could be used to answer the question: what in the
   methods,research programs, tools, goals, foundations, concepts and
   theories, language,research foci, institutions, pedagogy,
   publications, etc of present- daybiology is good and bad?

 <h>  Help Treat the Hardest Things

  <p> At any moment in a given field certain problems, tasks, questions,
   methods,phenomena, domains, unmet needs, goals, concepts, subfields,
   etc explicitlyor implicitly exist that are the most difficult ones of
   all in that field;and a subset of these things will be the hardest
   things in human knowledgeand endeavor as a whole.

  <p> Breakthroughs in these cases are apt to cause the greatest
   excitement,have the largest consequences for those fields or for
   civilization, shiftparadigms or upend cherished beliefs, reorient or
   revolutionize theoreticalor experimental inquiry, initiate new fields
   of investigation, concludeor commence the longest-lived and most
   emotional squabbles, etc.

 <p>  In an abstract and generic sense the hardest things are apt to be
   orrelate to: Demonstrations that a postulated or implied entity or
   relationshipexists or does not exist, or is possible or impossible;
   Firm proofs ordisproofs of a proposition or hypothesis; Unifications
   of an entire fieldor theory; Proofs of the equivalence or
   nonequivalence of two fundamentalthings; Universality of some concept,
   law, relation, or phenomenon; Demonstrationthat a certain thing is
   truly fundamental or more fundamental than anythingelse known or
   possible; Falsification or modification of what are assumedto be
   universal or absolute laws, constants, theories, etc; Gaining
   ofabsolute or overriding control over some system, process, or
   phenomenon;Obtaining complete knowledge or understanding of a thing;
   Advancesinvolving extremely complex or chaotic phenomena; Matters that
   requirebreakthroughs in pure or applied logic; Etc.

 <p>  For a variety of reasons ideonomy may in the future play an
   importantrole in the treatment of the hardest things: It may be a
   fallacy thatthe hardness of solving certain classes of problems is
   fundamental, intrinsic,and irreducible--and ideonomy may help
   challenge this highly influentialfallacy; it may be a fallacy that
   there is only one way to solve certainproblems or answer certain
   questions--and ideonomy may have a peculiarpower to bring to light the
   actual richness of possibilities; One of thespurs for the creation of
   ideonomy in the first place was the attempt tofurnish the human mind
   with some universally more powerful instrument inthe treatment of
   extreme difficulty and complexity, and in the handlingof the special
   problems being created by the explosive growth of humanknowledge,
   technology, and endeavor; Unexpected analogies may exist betweenthe
   hardest things in different sciences, the concepts and methods
   pertinentthereto, the importances thereof, and even the basic
   solutions to the problemsrepresented by such things--analogies that
   ideonomy can help to revealand treat; Ideonomy can be used to
   ascertain and dramatize the absoluteand relative need, importance, and
   consequences of achieving the hardestthings; Ideonomy can systematize,
   coordinate, accelerate, and maximizethe imagination and discovery of
   the totality of hardest things; Usuallyfew people know of the
   existence, nature, and implications of the hardestthings, and ideonomy
   can make such knowledge more broadly available, bothwithin the
   relevant field and outside it; Etc.

 <p>  Some illustrative examples of the hardest things are: Whether,in
   mathematics, there are fractional alefs, or whether alef one is or
   isnot equivalent to the power of the continuum; Nature of measurement
   inquantum theory; Fundamental relationship between quantum and
   relativityphysics; How our brain thinks or computers can be made to
   think as wellor better; Fundamental relationship between the physical
   and mental aspectsof nature; Basic nature of mathematical truth;
   Question as to the ultimatesafety of scientific and technological
   progress, or of how to insure itssafety; Many- body problems in
   mathematical physics; What the essentialnature of life is; Whether
   actual infinities exist in nature or natureis wholly finite and
   discrete; Why nature itself exists in the first place;Extent to which
   our picture of nature is reducible to one or a few things(e.g. laws,
   forces, entities, sciences, theories, representations,
   phenomena,relationships, processes, principles, substances, problems,
   concepts, etc);Unification of gravitation with the other known
   fundamental physical forces;Isolation of the fundamental,
   quantitative, and predictive laws of societyor of social behavior and

  <l> What are all of the hardest problems and possibilities that are
   connectedwith a single, random or particular, thing?

  <l> Where would all of the examples of hardest things that were
   mentionedabove fall on a universal scale of degrees of hardness? Which
   of the thingswould be most ambiguous or hard to place on such a scale?

   <l>What hierarchies of hardest things are there? Also what series,
   networks,trees, rings (sic), clusters, etc?

  <l> Which of the things listed above should be tackled first and last
   --andwhy?

  <l> Are there things that are by definition, or that can be proven in
   advanceto be, infinitely hard to accomplish or know?

 <l>  Where would the examples of hardest things above all fall on a
   scalegiving the imagined quantity of future time that will or must
   elapse beforethat which they speak of becomes known or is achieved?

 <l>  What are the basic reasons for the hardness of each of those things?

  <l> Which of those apparent or supposed hardnesses may in fact be
   illusory?

 <l>  On the other hand, which of all those things that would seem to us
   easyto accomplish or know in the future, may actually turn out to be
   hard oramong the hardest of possibilities?

  <l> What were the hardest problems historically and how were they
   solved?Moreover, what resulted from their solution or explanation-and
   what lessonsmay there be for us now as we confront those things that
   for ourselvesare the hardest to come to terms with?

 <h>  Describe Hierarchies

 <p>  From the point of view of ideonomy, an infinite number and variety
   ofhierarchies may well exist in and as nature, and all things, in some
   sense,may be hierarchical or possess hierarchical aspects, elements,
   and relationships.

  <p>  The foreseen task is to find and define the totality of such
   hierarchiesand hierarchical relationships, to identify the laws
   thereof, and to progressivelyexploit the opportunities implicit in
   such things.

  <p>  Of course hierarchy represents just one of the basic genera
   ofso-called meta-structures that presumably pervade the universe or
   'reality',but the exemplifications, meanings, and possibilities of
   each such genusmust be thoroughly investigated and elaborated. The
   case of hierarchy canserve as a general example of what must be done
   and of what is apt to followupon the doing of it.

   <p> What is meant by the word or concept of hierarchy? One way to
   answerthis question is by seeing what hierarchy could mean--or what
   hierarchiesmay in fact, or could in theory, exist--in connection with
   a variety ofthings. For example:

  <p>  Could there be a hierarchy of snowflakes? Actually there couldbe many
   such hierarchies: Presumably there is a probability spectrum
   fordifferent flake shapes; Formative mechanisms may be plural or
   subject tocomplication or external influences, in which case either
   the causes ortheir effects may canonically progress in chains and
   branch in--chronologicalor nomological-- trees; Probability or
   existence of certain flake formsmay be a function of the set-theoretic
   statistics or combinatorial clusteringof other flake forms; Etc.

   <p> A hierarchy of winters? Perhaps winters can be
   multidimensionallydescribed and there are certain types of winters
   that are only likely toto occur after, or somewhere in the middle of,
   certain sequences of othertypes of winters; Perhaps there is a
   hierarchy of descriptions or of descriptiveelements, such that certain
   descriptions or elements are more fundamentalor at least simpler than
   others, and it is appropriate or necessary to'move along' the
   hierarchy in attempting to characterize winters; Etc.

   <p> A hierarchy of stars? Certain stars generate chemical elementsand
   isotopes that are then recycled in other stars and without which
   thoseother types and generations of stars are impossible; Similar
   stellar hierarchymay exist thanks to the production, recycling,
   multistage transformation,or control of different molecular species by
   generations--or perhaps bysynchronic hierarchies--of stars;
   Hierarchical sets of stars may createdifferent physical conditions at
   a variety of levels (e.g. of stellar density)that induce special types
   of stars, or of stellar behavior, at those levels;Etc.

   <p> Possible or actual properties, dimensions, or features of
   hierarchiesor of their contents include: Elements; Sets, subsets, and
   supersets;Levels; Degrees; Layers; Ranges; Intervals; Gaps; Folia;
   Partitions; Stages;Chains or sequences; Series; Harmonics or powers;
   Units and multiples;Domination and subordination; Supreme commander;
   Tops, apexes, vertexes,etc; Bottoms, bases, roots, foundations, etc;
   Starts, origins, first things,a single beginner, etc; Stops, finishes,
   last things, etc; Greatest ormaximal thing; Least or minimal things or
   thing; Thresholds; Transformations;Rhythms, cycles, iterations,
   reappearances, etc; Poles, orientations, etc;Inversions; Transitivity;
   Asymmetry; Antisymmetry; Control, government,or regulation; Ranks;
   Superiority; One-many relationships; Trees or arborescence;Direction;
   Unidirectional action; Dependences, independences, and
   interdependences;Monotonic progression; Emergence; Equivalent and
   nonequivalent elements;Simplicity; Internal structure and external
   form; Completeness and all-inclusiveness; Horizontal and vertical
   relationships; Rules; Defined orexact relationships; Continuity;
   Universality; Pyramidality; Discrete andcontinuous aspects; Opposites,
   antipolarity, and antisyzygies; Uniquenessor singularity;
   Unity-in-diversity; Spectrums; Convergence, divergence,and vergence;
   Orthogonality; Etc.

  <p> Possible effects, values, or uses of hierarchies include:
   Arbitrarilylarge sets of things or elements can be connected, reduced,
   related, ortraced back to, or derived from, just a single thing,
   element:, point,event, law, etc.--via a path that is at once maximally
   short, powerful,comprehensive, logical, necessary, central,
   self-similar, ubiquitous, etc;Causation, perturbation, government, etc
   can be shown to be, or treatedas being, completely unidirectional and
   an incremental and comprehensiveflow over an arbitrarily large set of
   identical or diverse things, processes,phenomena, domains, effects,
   changes, events, etc; Time-asymmetric evolutionof an entire system or
   universe; Flows in two opposite and paired directionscan be enabled or
   defined--flows of an opposite, complementary, reciprocal,or
   independent nature or content; Things or processes of every
   possiblesize, number, or complexity can all be 'reduced' to the
   dimidiations, doublings,bifurcations, partitionings, iterations,
   recursions, fractal structure,or the like of a single thing, process,
   pattern, or the like--so that thesmallest and largest scales or sets,
   first and last things, whole and parts,e/vc of the hierarchy are
   mutually derived, antisyzygially, in an exactor approximate way;
   Generalization, specialization, and their
   interdetermination;Alternative descriptions, classifications, or
   treatments of things canbe rigorously excluded; Possibilities can be
   constrained; Different anddisjunct trees of possibilities can be
   differentiated and selected; Thingscan be described or controlled via
   the simplest language, code, logic,or information-theoretic structure;
   Operations or actions can be reducedto uniquely consecutive and finite
   decisions; Variables can be treatedas constants, and constants as
   variables, at successive 'levels'; Thosedegrees of freedom that enable
   the self- organization of a phenomenon orrealm can be increased or
   maximized; Potential or actual self-interaction,self-government,
   self-connection, autocorrelation, self-description,
   complexity,heterogeneity, proteanness, e/vc of a thing or phenomenon
   can be maximized;Use of resources can be optimized, or need for
   resources minimized; Redundancycan be minimized, irredundancy
   maximized (and vice versa, paradoxically);Etc.

  <p>  In a simpler way, hierarchies or hierarchization can serve, i.

  <p> Particularly or peculiarly interesting genera of hierarchies in
   thislist are in upper case. Many suggest fascinating problems,
   questions, andpossibilities--which ideonomy will eventually address.

   <p> Actually many things need to be learned about all of those genera.
   Thuswhat are all of their: exemplifications, specializations, causes,
   effects,roles, interrelations and interactions, laws, activities,
   structures, transformations,histories, futures, evolutions and
   retrogressions, fine structure, etc?

   <p> Hierarchy can be defined in many different ways. The dictionary
   distinguishes:(1) The arrangement of objects, elements, or values in a
   graduated series;(2) A series of objects, elements, or values so
   arranged; (3) In logic,a series the members of which are grouped in
   accordance with a principle(as of importance, perfection, or
   priority); (4) The stratification soachieved; specifically, a table of
   statistical correlations havinga constant proportional relationship
   and graded from high to low; (5) Abody of persons or things ranked in
   grades, orders, or classes, one aboveanother; a system or series of
   terms of successive rank, used in classification(as in biology).

  <p>  Additionally, of the adjective "hierarchical" it says: (6) Having
   thepower to control; influential.

  <p>  A more ideonomic characterization of hierarchy: (7) At the top or
   upwardis the thing or set of things that controls, dominates,
   influences, limits,expresses, indicates, facilitates, e/vc the
   meaning, importance, behavior,degrees of freedom, changes,
   possibilities, relationships, aspects, costs,needs, outputs, e/vc of
   that below or dot-inward.
