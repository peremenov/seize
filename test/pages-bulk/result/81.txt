 <p>   Visotek Inc. (Plymouth, MI), Fraunhofer USA Center for Laser
   Technology (Plymouth, MI), and Bender Shipbuilding & Repair Co.
   (Mobile, AL) teamed up to develop the first autogenous laser welding
   application in a U.S. shipyard in a program sponsored by the Office of
   Naval Research through its Small Business Innovation Research program.
   The goal was to develop and qualify laser welding as a cost-effective
   method for producing tab-and-slot sandwich panels. It was also
   required to use Bender's existing large laser cutting gantry, and the
   time for converting from cutting to welding should be less than 30
   minutes.

  <p>  Tab-and-slot sandwich panels use the laser to cut the stiffeners with
   twist tabs and to cut the mating slots in the face sheets. In a second
   operation the stiffeners are assembled with the faceplates and the
   twist tabs are turned to hold the assembly together. In another
   operation laser welding is performed through the faceplates into the
   stiffener. This concept allows fixtureless manufacturing of large
   sandwich panels, representing dramatic cost savings. It also enables
   sandwich panels where the thickness and location of the stiffener can
   be designed for optimum load bearing and load distribution. A
   well-known analogy in automotive industry is (non-linear) tailored
   blanks. Three-dimensional tailored blanks are also possible through
   cutting curved stiffeners and rolling the faceplate to the form of the
   stiffeners. The process, weld cross section, and product are shown in
   Figure 1.

                      

  <p>    The laser beam is scanned across the thickness of the stiffener to
     achieve full fusion at the interface between the stiffener and the
    faceplate. The resulting weld nugget shows no porosity and a convex
     shape in the edges, which indicates high strength and high fatigue
   life. Single path laser welding was also investigated, but much higher
   porosity and incomplete fusion at the interface were found. To achieve
      full fusion the individual single path weld lines had to overlap
    significantly resulting in increased weld time compared to the weave
                                   weld.

 <p>   In the spring of this year, a Flexible Laser Optic (FLO) was installed
    on Bender's Tanaka 6kW CO2 laser cutter. Cutting accuracies of 0.001
     in. are achieved over the entire 20-ft. width and 160-ft. length.
   Changing to this optic allowed Bender to become the first shipyard in
      the United States to successfully laser weld a structural steel
   sandwich panel on the shipyard's production equipment. Sandwich panels
    were welded, using 6 kW of power, with a speed of 30 ipm for 1/8 in.
              and 15 ipm for 3/8 in. thickness (see Figure 2).
                        

   <p>   Through further development and higher laser power, the FLO system
     will be used for welding up to Â½-in. thick sandwich panels. Future
     work includes additional process development for materials such as
        aluminum and high strength and stainless steel to enable the
    fabrication of panels for lightweight ship construction. Integration
   of seam tracking and weld monitoring will also be pursued to meet the
     100 percent weld inspection that is now required for all new naval
   construction. The technology has opened the door for cost effectively
        manufacturing a wide variety of sandwich panels with complex
    geometries using the tab-and-slot design together with laser welding
                 of the stiffeners through the face sheets.
                              
 <h>			      Remote welding

 <p>   In parallel, Visotek and Fraunhofer have been pursuing robotic remote
     welding with the FLO system. The first remote welding systems used
   fast scanning mirrors instead of gantries or robots to move the laser
    beam quickly from one weld line to the next, a benefit, if multiple
    short welds have to be performed on different locations of the work
    piece, such as welding reinforcements in place. The scanning mirrors
   can move the laser beam quickly, in a matter of tens of milliseconds,
   across the working envelope, while conventional motion systems require
    seconds for repositioning. Dramatic increases in productivity, up to
   ten times higher, and a laser on-time of more than 95 percent result.
   State-of-the-art systems use a high beam quality CO2 laser with up to
    6kW output power and a stationary scanning system, limiting the part
     geometry to two dimensions in one plane. The working envelope of a
     single scanner system with fixed optic is mainly determined by the
       beam quality of the laser, limiting the maximum laser power to
       currently 6 kW and thus the maximum welding speed and material
                                 thickness.

  <p>   Three-dimensional remote welding was recently introduced by putting
   the scanner on the arm of a robot. This combines the capabilities and
         cost effectiveness of robotics with the fast beam steering
     capabilities of the scanner. The robotic path can be planned with
    minimum accelerations and large radii, while the scanner compensates
    for kinked or sharply curved weld lines. Multiple weld patterns are
    possible, such as a spot with about 10 mm diameter in analogy to the
     size of a resistance spot weld, staples, or straight stitches. The
        actual weld pattern is tailored to the strength and fatigue
   requirements of the part. Nd:YAG or fiber lasers with up to 4 kW power
     and good beam quality, typically delivered through a 0.2mm optical
      cable, are used in combination with special high-power scanning
      systems. About 50 robotic remote welding systems are now used in
        production at various automotive plants and their suppliers.

  <p>    CO2 lasers represent a much more cost effective laser system than
   Nd:YAG or fiber lasers, however, their long wavelength does not allow
     the use of dielectric, lightweight mirrors as they are deployed in
     conventional high-speed scanners. The FLO optic with water-cooled
    mirrors and proprietary drives is mounted at the end of a robot. The
   beam from a 6kW PRC laser is delivered through an articulated arm. The
   motion of the scanner is synchronized with the motion of the robot to
   produce a circular weld line with 8mm diameter. Test coupons with 1mm
   thickness of the upper sheet and 2mm thickness of the lower sheet were
      used for the initial welding trials. At a robot speed of about 6
        m/min, 240 spots per minute could be welded (see Figure 3).
                       

   <p>    Clear heat marks were visible at the bottom side of the coupons,
    indicating the potential for even higher welding speeds. The coupons
       were arranged in a different level (see Figure 3) to prove the
      functionality and response time of the integrated autofocus. No
   difference in weld quality and penetration depth could be detected in
    the two spots next to the step. The system is currently benchmarked
        against a conventional remote welding system, an automotive
              application, welding reinforcements to a fender.

  <p>     The use of cost-effective CO2 lasers and the high power handling
    capabilities of FLO optics can increase productivity through higher
     welding speeds or welding of thicker materials. Because it can be
   easily retrofit to conventional laser systems and robots found in many
    manufacturing facilities, the system offers a viable alternative to
        resistance spot welding at minimum capital equipment costs.
