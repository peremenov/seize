     <h>                               Abstract

   <p>  Examines critically the origins and basis of 'knowledge
     management', its components and its development as a field of
     consultancy practice. Problems in the distinction between
     'knowledge' and 'information' are explored, as well as Polanyi's
     concept of 'tacit knowing'. The concept is examined in the journal
     literature, the Web sites of consultancy companies, and in the
     presentation of business schools. The conclusion is reached that
     'knowledge management' is an umbrella term for a variety of
     organizational activities, none of which are concerned with the
     management of knowledge. Those activities that are not concerned
     with the management of information are concerned with the
     management of work practices, in the expectation that changes in
     such areas as communication practice will enable information
     sharing.

  <h>Introduction

 <p>  The growth of 'knowledge management' as a strategy of consultancy
   companies is one of a series of such strategies dating from Taylor's
   (1911) 'scientific management' of the early part of the last century.
   'Time and motion study' developed directly out of scientific
   management and continued into the 1970s as a widespread industrial
   engineering technique. In the late 1930s, the 'human relations school'
   emerged out of research between 1927 and 1932 at the Western Electric
   Hawthorne Works in Chicago (Mayo, 1933) and had a considerable
   influence in the emerging consultancy companies after the Second World
   War.

  <p> In the second half of the last century, the pace of new techniques
   quickened considerably: we have seen (not in chronological order and
   not a complete list):

 <l>       'the repertory grid'             'management by objectives'
 <l>      'theory X and theory Y'                   'T-groups'
 <l>     'the matrix organization'    'Planning Programming Budgeting System'
 <l>      'zero-based budgeting'            'organization development'
 <l>    'total quality management'                 'downsizing'
 <l>     'organizational learning'              'systems thinking'
 <l>          'team-building'                    'cultural change'
 <l>  'strategic information systems'             'benchmarking'
<l>      'ISO9000 certification'             'the balanced scorecard'
<l>        'core competencies'           'business process re-engineering'
<l>   'enterprise resource planning'    'customer relationship management'
  <p>                                and now
  <l>                        'knowledge management'.

<p>   These have sometimes been called management fads and fashions, but it
   would be wrong to assume that, for that reason, they all lacked
   effectiveness when applied in organizations. Some, however, have been
   disastrous: Stephen Roach, Chief Economist at Morgan Stanley, was a
   strong protagonist for downsizing, arguing that it was the cure for
   any company's problems, but in 1997 he reversed that opinion, arguing
   that, on the contrary, it could be a recipe for industrial disaster.
   Jenkins (1997) reports Cameron, a researcher in organizational
   behaviour, as saying that, "downsizing [is] the most pervasive yet
   unsuccessful change effort in the business world". Some techniques
   fail, or at least are dropped from the repertoire, because they are
   Utopian in character: organizations are told that the technique must
   be applied throughout the organization for the full benefits to be
   achieved. This was the case with business process re-engineering, but
   businesses quickly realised that the costs of carrying out BPR
   throughout the organization would be crippling and, because they
   attempted to apply the technique to only part of the company, the
   results were less than satisfactory - in fact, two thirds of BPR
   efforts are said to have failed (Hall, et al., 1994). Knowledge
   management (whatever it is) also shows signs of being offered as a
   Utopian ideal and the results are likely to be similar.

<h>'Knowledge' and 'information'

<p>   In management consultancy it is, perhaps, not too serious to fail to
   distinguish between related concepts (although I suspect that
   management researchers would not be happy with this proposition), but
   for the fields of information science and information systems, it is
   clearly necessary for us to distinguish between 'information' and
   'knowledge'. Failure to do so results in one or other of these terms
   standing as a synonym for the other, thereby confusing anyone who
   wishes to understand what each term signifies.

<p>   Happily, it is quite easy to distinguish between 'knowledge' and
   'information' in such a way as to remove ambiguity and, at the same
   time, demonstrate the fundamental nonsense of 'knowledge management'.

 <p>  'Knowledge' is defined as what we know: knowledge involves the mental
   processes of comprehension, understanding and learning that go on in
   the mind and only in the mind, however much they involve interaction
   with the world outside the mind, and interaction with others. Whenever
   we wish to express what we know, we can only do so by uttering
   messages of one kind or another - oral, written, graphic, gestural or
   even through 'body language'. Such messages do not carry 'knowledge',
   they constitute 'information', which a knowing mind may assimilate,
   understand, comprehend and incorporate into its own knowledge
   structures. These structures are not identical for the person uttering
   the message and the receiver, because each person's knowledge
   structures are, as Schutz (1967) puts it, 'biographically determined'.
   Therefore, the knowledge built from the messages can never be exactly
   the same as the knowledge base from which the messages were uttered.

 <p>  In common usage, these two terms are frequently used as synonyms, but
   the task of the academic researcher is to clarify the use of terms so
   that the field of investigation has a clearly defined vocabulary. The
   present confusion over 'knowledge management' illustrates this need
   perfectly.

 <p>  The consequence of this analysis is that everything outside the mind
   that can be manipulated in any way, can be defined as 'data', if it
   consists of simple facts, or as 'information', if the data are
   embedded in a context of relevance to the recipient. Collections of
   messages, composed in various ways, may be considered as 'information
   resources' of various kinds - collections of papers in a journal,
   e-mail messages in an electronic 'folder', manuscript letters in an
   archive, or whatever. Generally, these are regarded as 'information
   resources'. Thus, data and information may be managed, and information
   resources may be managed, but knowledge (i.e., what we know) can never
   be managed, except by the individual knower and, even then, only
   imperfectly. The fact is that we often do not know what we know: that
   we know something may only emerge when we need to employ the knowledge
   to accomplish something. Much of what we have learnt is apparently
   forgotten, but can emerge unexpectedly when needed, or even when not
   needed. In other words we seem to have very little control over 'what
   we know'.

<h>What is 'knowledge management'?

 <p>  If the definitions above are adequate to distinguish between
   'knowledge' and 'information' (and genuine debate on this would be
   useful), the question of what 'knowledge management' might be becomes
   interesting. The Web of Science (all three citation indexes) was
   searched, from 1981 to 2002 for papers with the term 'knowledge
   management' in the title. The search was restricted to the title
   mainly to produce a manageable data file, but also on the proposition
   that if the term appeared in the title, the papers were likely to
   focus clearly on the topic. The result is shown in Figure 1:

                                

 <p>  It can be seen that the term did not occur until 1986 and from 1986 to
   1996, there were only a few occurrences in each year. From 1997 to
   date, however, the growth has been exponential, but the data for 2002
   suggest that the rate of growth has slowed considerably. (Note) There
   is, of course, a problem with a quantitative analysis of this kind -
   we do not know whether all of the items in the file actually deal with
   the same subject. Given the fuzziness of the term, authors may be
   using it to cover a very diverse range of topics. This problem is
   addressed, partly, in what follows.

  <p> When we look in more detail at the items in the first eleven years
   (1986-1996) we find a very wide range of subjects represented under
   the heading 'knowledge management'. Two items were simply editorials
   in journals - when these are removed we are left with thirty-three
   papers, the largest single category of which deal with artificial
   intelligence and expert systems (seven papers), followed by general
   aspects of computing (four papers), decision support systems (three
   papers) information technology in general (two papers) and
   miscellaneous subjects (i.e., databases, digitisation, geographical
   information systems, and human-computer interaction - four papers)
   Taking these together as dealing with computing and its applications,
   we have 61% of the papers. Apart from these computing topics we have
   education, the human genome project, information policy, information
   management, organizational structure, product development,
   terminology, and a variety of other subjects. Clearly, however, before
   the surge in publication in 1997, 'knowledge management' meant some
   application or other of computers, with the influence stemming from
   the notion of 'knowledge bases' in the expert systems field. The
   analysis also suggests that, from the beginning, there has been
   confusion over what the term meant, since few of these papers bother
   to define the term.

<p>   This focus on technology appears to persist: I downloaded 158
   references from the Web of Science for 1999 to 2001 into EndNote and
   then searched the abstracts for specific terms: without taking account
   of double counting, 'information technology', 'technology' and
   'software' occurred a total of 66 times, while 'information sharing',
   'communities of practice' and 'knowledge sharing' occurred a total of
   only 10 times.

 <p>  To determine the current nature of 'knowledge management' in more
   detail, I searched the Web of Science again (all three citation
   indexes) for papers published in 2001 with the phrase 'knowledge
   management' in the record. Excluding abstracts of papers, this
   produced 242 items, distributed over 106 journals. On a relatively
   crude classification, the 106 journals were distributed across 26
   subject fields, with six fields having more than three journal titles.
   This suggests that the concept (although interpreted in different ways
   in different fields) is widely distributed across fields of practice.

                              

 <h>                         Subject area                         No. of titles

 <p>  Only 41 journals carried more than one paper with the relevant phrase
   in the title in the year, and only 10 journals carried more than four.
   These were:

 <l>       Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association  5

<p>   Assuming that these journals constitute the 'core' journals of the
   field (at least for the year 2001), it is interesting to note the
   strong orientation towards the field of information systems. At least
   six of the journals are in this area, seven if we include medical
   informatics within information systems. The exceptions are Expert
   systems with applications and Nfd Information Wissenschaft und Praxis
   (interestingly, the only information science journal in the set -
   although others appear with lower paper counts). This raises the
   suspicion that, while the range of subject fields in which the concept
   appears may be wide, the subject within any field is likely to have an
   information systems orientation.

 <p>  Further examination of the journals revealed that eight of the papers
   retrieved were simply Editorials to thematic issues and that the IBM
   Systems Journal special issue had twelve papers rather than the seven
   revealed by the search. This gives a grand total of eighty papers to
   examine to discover what they have in common that can define
   'knowledge management'.

<h>  Decision Support Systems

 <p>  Ten of these papers were in one special issue devoted to 'knowledge
   management'. In seven of the eleven papers, the authors are using
   'knowledge' simply as a synonym for 'information'. Use of the word
   'knowledge' adds nothing to the argument and often simply confuses.
   Sometimes the terms are juxtaposed in curious ways, for example:

 <p>    "Knowledge management has inspired a shift from a transaction to a
     distributed knowledge management (DKM) perspective on
     inter-organizational information processing Each player in the
     network acquires specific knowledge from other players for decision
     support." (Pederson & Larson, 2001)

 <p>  This appears to mean no more than, 'We have decided to call
   inter-organizational information systems that involve information
   sharing "distributed knowledge management systems"'.

<p>   One of the eleven papers deals with data-mining, and one deals with
   business process re-engineering. One offers a systems framework for
   knowledge management, which is little different from a systems
   framework for information management, and one explores how managers
   need to understand things before they make decisions (!).

<h>  Journal of Management Information Systems

<p>   All of the papers in this journal were in one special issue devoted to
   'knowledge management' and one was simply the Editorial, without an
   abstract. The papers are rather less information systems focused than
   in Decision Support Systems and cover a wide range of topics. At least
   three or four are simply using 'knowledge' as a synonym for
   'information' and at times the jargon that attempts to hide this fact
   can be impenetrable One deals with ways to make e-mail more effective,
   one with other aspects of communication in organization, one with
   intellectual property rights, one with the fact that firms need an
   information infrastructure, and one deals with how difficult it is to
   transfer 'tacit knowledge' - quoting Polanyi, but assuming, wrongly,
   that tacit knowledge can be made explicit.

<h>  Wirtschaftsinformatik

 <p>  Another case of the number of papers being inflated by a special issue
   - eight of the ten papers are from this issue and one appears to be
   the Editorial. Half of the papers are simply using 'knowledge' as a
   synonym; for example, describing documents as 'documented knowledge',
   two deal with the barriers in human communication in organizations,
   one with expert systems, one with hiring people to acquire 'external
   information', and one with the evaluation of 'knowledge management
   systems', i.e., information systems under another name.

<h>  European Journal of Information Systems

 <p>  Six of the nine papers were in one issue of the journal and one was
   the Editorial. The remaining five deal with various organizational
   issues, usually without defining what is meant be knowledge, so that
   one is forced to the conclusion that the authors are writing about
   'information'. How is it possible, for example, to speak of
   transferring 'knowledge' into a 'database'? It is possible to transfer
   data about what we know into a database, but it is never possible to
   transfer the knowledge. Only one paper (Sutton, 2001) asks what
   knowledge is and whether it can be managed, but then confuses things
   by referring to information as 'codified knowledge'. In fact, in most
   papers, one has the impression that the authors are trying desperately
   to avoid talking about information and information systems -
   presumably in order to satisfy the requirements for having their
   papers accepted in a special issue!

 <h> Expert Systems with Applications

 <p>  Another special issue in which all of the papers are attempts to
   present expert systems as part of the 'knowledge management' fashion.
   Various techniques are described as 'knowledge management tools', but
   in all cases it turns out that these involve not knowledge but, for
   example, information about the intellectual resources of a firm, or
   software 'agents' that function on the use of information. It all
   appears to be part of the attempt to re-sell expert systems under a
   new label.

<h>  Nfd Information Wissenschaft und Praxis

<p>   Occasionally authors get tangled up in the lack of a clear distinction
   between knowledge and information: thus an 'Enterprise Information
   Portal' becomes a 'knowledge management system'. (Koenemann, et al.,
   2000) . This journal is predominantly concerned with information
   science (as the title indicates) and, not surprisingly two of the
   papers are concerned with information retrieval and information
   extraction, one with journals and patents as repositories of
   'organizational knowledge', one with information software of various
   kinds, one with the role of the information worker in a 'knowledge
   economy', and two with the use of the 'balanced scorecard' technique -
   thereby nicely linking two managerial fads!

<h>  IBM Systems Journal

 <p>  All of the papers are in one special issue of the journal, which, in
   fact, contains thirteen papers on the subject, not simply the seven
   retrieved by the search strategy. The papers are rather more diverse
   that those in the journals examined previously and, overall, are less
   oriented towards information systems. Nevertheless, five papers have a
   technology orientation. The first of these, by Marwick (2001) is
   flawed simply because it accepts, uncritically, Nonaka's mistaken
   understanding of Polanyi's concept of tacit and explicit knowledge.
   However, this analysis is soon abandoned because Marwick comes to the
   unsurprising conclusion that, 'there are still significant shortfalls
   in the ability of technology to support the use of tacit knowledge -
   for which face-to-face meetings are still the touchstone of
   effectiveness.' and 'the strongest contribution to current solutions
   is made by technologies that deal largely with explicit knowledge,
   such as search and classification.' ['Explicit knowledge', of course,
   is simply a synonym for 'information'.] The first of the remaining
   'technology' papers deals with 'knowledge portals', which turn out to
   be, 'single-point-access software systems intended to provide easy and
   timely access to information and to support communities of knowledge
   workers who share common goals.' In other words, a Web-based
   information system. The rationale for adopting the term 'knowledge
   portal' becomes very convoluted at times: 'We refer to information
   portals used by knowledge workers as knowledge portals (or K Portals
   for short) to differentiate this KM role and usage from other portal
   roles, such as consumer shopping or business-to-business commerce.'
   (Mack, et al., 2001). The 'Lotus Knowledge Discovery System' (Pohs, et
   al., 2001) consists of a 'K-station portal', which is a system to
   manage 'mail, calendar, discussions, to-do items, team rooms, custom
   applications, and Web sites' [Lotus Domino perhaps?], the 'Discovery
   Server', which is 'an index to the written information and expertise
   that exist within an organization' and which includes 'spiders' to
   gather information from Notes databases, file system files, and
   external Web sites, and the 'K-map', which is, essentially, an
   information mapping and retrieval system. Of the remaining two
   technology oriented papers one is on the application of data-mining
   techniques to textual data bases, but instead of referring to this as
   'text-mining', it is described as 'knowledge-mining'. The other paper
   is a review of the state of the art of speech recognition.

<p>   Four papers have more of a social or human orientation: two deal with
   'communities of practice', defined as 'a group whose members regularly
   engage in sharing and learning, based on their common interests'
   (Lesser & Storck, 2001). Somewhat obviously, the authors conclude that
   such groups benefit the organizations of which they form part, and
   ought to be fostered by management. The second paper (Gongla &
   Rizzuto, 2001) describes how such communities have been fostered in
   IBM. The remaining two papers in this category deal with "human and
   social factors in knowledge management" and with possibility that
   one's view of knowledge management is likely to be determined by one's
   personality type - while this argument might have some force, however,
   the paper is devoid of data and simply offers speculation. Even the
   first of these two is, in part, a thinly disguised discussion of
   technology, so perhaps it ought to go into the first category of
   technology related papers. The authors describe an experimental system
   at IBM called 'Babble', which 'resembles a multichannel, text-based
   chat system to which many users can connect, and either select from a
   list of conversations to participate in, or create their own.'
   (Thomas, et al., 2001) The authors claim that the system differs from
   a conventional chat system in two ways: first, by the text of the chat
   persisting over time so that anyone joining a chat can review the
   whole of what has gone before, and secondly, by representing the
   participants graphically so that who is present can be seen in one of
   the windows on the screen. Quite how this constitutes 'knowledge
   management' is not explained.

<p>   Two of the remaining three papers deal with what we might term
   business processes: Fahey, et al.
   (2001) examine the role of knowledge management in linking e-business
   and operating processes, which boils down to saying that businesses
   need to know about their customers in order to develop the right
   products and the appropriate means of reaching those customers. Here,
   'knowledge' is, in general, a synonym for information and, where it is
   not, the authors are describing ways of organizing people so that
   information can be shared. The second paper, on exchanging 'knowledge
   resources' in strategic alliances suffers from the same problem -
   generally, the knowledge resources turn out to be information
   resources, 'contracts, manuals, databases, licenses, or embedded in
   products' or people (Parise & Henderson, 2001).

 <p>  The final paper in the collection is, 'Where did knowledge management
   come from?' (Prusak, 2001) This is an interesting paper, which
   cleverly tries to defuse the proposition that knowledge management is
   nothing but a management consultancy fad, claiming that, 'knowledge
   management is not just a consultants' invention but a
   practitioner-based, substantive response to real social and economic
   trends'. However, no evidence is produced to support this contention,
   so we must assume that it is little more than management consultancy
   rhetoric.

 <p>  I have given this issue of IBM Systems Journal more attention than the
   others partly because some of the papers are genuinely interesting and
   partly because they are freely available on the Web. However, they
   reveal much of the same tendencies as in the other journals: a concern
   with information technology, a tendency to elide the distinction
   between 'knowledge' (what I know) and 'information' (what I am able to
   convey about what I know), and confusion of the management of work
   practices in the organization with the management of knowledge.

<h>  Journal of Strategic Information Systems

<p>   Again, we have a special issue devoted to knowledge management (and,
   interesting to note, no other issue in 2000 had any papers on the
   subject). We have here a disparate mix of papers (one is the
   Editorial), half of them concerned with technology. For example, one
   explores how artificial intelligence might help knowledge management -
   the general conclusion appears to be 'not a lot at present'; another,
   more interestingly, shows the lack of congruence between what a group
   of competitive intelligence analysts did and the technology being
   developed to help them (Schultze & Boland, 2000). Two or three papers,
   however, deal with the 'people problems': why people do or do not help
   one another in communities of practice (Wasko & Faraj, 2000) and how
   people need to share some underlying cognitive framework if they are
   to benefit from attempts to share information (Merali, 2000).

<h>  Journal of Management Studies

 <p>  Another special issue and, again, one of the items is the Editorial.
   As with the other journals, one of the things that jumps out of the
   page is the lack of any consensus about what 'knowledge management'
   might be. A thoughtful paper argues that, ' knowledge is an ambiguous,
   unspecific and dynamic phenomenon, intrinsically related to meaning,
   understanding and process, and therefore difficult to manage.' and
   'knowledge management is as likely, if not more so, to operate as a
   practice of managing people or information than as a practice attuned
   towards facilitating knowledge creation.' (Alvesson & Karreman, 2001).
   Another paper, on 'dispersed knowledge' in organizations (Becker,
   2001) is a case of 'knowledge' being used as a synonym for
   information. The remaining papers are, in effect, cases on how
   information is created in organizations, and how information is used
   to guide practice - needless to say, information in these cases is
   called 'knowledge' without the distinction being elucidated.

<h>  Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association

<p>   The final case is a little complicated, since the search for items in
   this journal published in 2001 revealed papers actually published in
   1999 and 2000 - an instance, presumably, of the Association being well
   behind in its publication programme. Three of the papers deal with the
   application of expert systems to clinical decision making and call it
   'knowledge management'; one (Swoboda, et al., 1999) reveals its
   confusion in the title: 'Knowledge management: easy access to clinical
   information'; and the last (Vimarlund, et al., 1999) uses 'knowledge'
   as a synonym for information.

 <p>  A number of points arise out of this analysis: first, it is curious
   that the vast majority of papers are in special issues of journals and
   that, in some cases, no other paper has been published on this topic
   in the same journal since 2001. This suggests that the topic has not
   entered the normal stream of papers in these journals using the same
   terminology - although papers on the same subjects - expert systems,
   decision making, decision support systems, etc., - have continued to
   be published. The second point reflects the first: there is absolutely
   no agreement on what constitutes 'knowledge management' and, in the
   case of the special issues there is a suspicion that the papers have
   adopted this terminology simply to be published in that issue.
   Thirdly, those papers that seriously address the question of whether
   knowledge can be managed generally conclude that it cannot and that
   the topic breaks down into the management of information and the
   management of work practices.
   humpty

 <p>  On the basis of this evidence, we appear to be with Alice in the land
   through the looking-glass, listening to Humpty Dumpty's theory of
   language.

 <p>  Of course, the citation indexes of ISI do not index all journals and
   it takes a considerable length of time before they accept that a
   journal is worthy of inclusion. This explains the absence of, for
   example, the Journal of Knowledge Management, now in its sixth volume
   and the freely available Journal of Knowledge Management Practice, now
   in its third volume. An examination of the contents of these journals
   reveals the same problems with the concept of 'knowledge management'
   as those set out above, and the quality of some of the papers is
   sometimes below that of the journals surveyed here. In the case of the
   Journal of Knowledge Management, we are informed that it is, 'not a
   refereed journal in its true academic sense.' (Emerald, n.d.) and this
   may be a contributory factor.

<h>The consultancy view

 <p>  If, as proposed, 'knowledge management' is, at its centre, a movement
   driven by management consultancies, it can be useful to look at some
   of these consultancies to discover what 'knowledge management' means
   to them. We can begin with one of the 'founding fathers' of the idea -
   perhaps the founding father - Karl Erik Sveiby, who wrote the first
   book on the subject in 1990 under the Swedish title, 'Kunskapledning'
   (Sveiby, 1990). Sveiby is now a consultant, based in Australia but
   working globally, and his Web site contains a great deal of
   information on the subject, although his main concern is now with the
   measurement of 'intangible assets' and other aspects of 'intellectual
   capital'. A paper originally written in 1996 notes that 'knowledge
   management' consists of two 'tracks': the 'IT- track', which is
   information management, and the 'people track', which is the
   management of people (Sveiby, 2001a). Elsewhere on the site, in the
   Frequently Asked Questions file, Sveiby answers the question, 'Why
   should knowledge be managed?', to which the response is:

<p>     I don't believe knowledge can be managed. Knowledge Management is a
     poor term, but we are stuck with it, I suppose. "Knowledge Focus"
     or "Knowledge Creation" (Nonaka) are better terms, because they
     describe a mindset, which sees knowledge as activity not an object.
     A is a human vision, not a technological one. (Sveiby, 2001b)

 <p>  Of course, academic researchers and teachers do not need to be 'stuck
   with' anything that fails to stand up to rigorous analysis, but it is
   interesting to see that one of the founders of 'knowledge management'
   is uncomfortable with the term.

<p>   Turning to an older and probably better known consultant, we find that
   Peter Drucker, one of the first people to write about the idea of the
   'knowledge society' and the 'knowledge economy' (Drucker, 1969),
   disputes the notion that knowledge can be managed. At the Delphi
   Group's Collaborative Commerce Summit, Kotzer (2001) reports Drucker
   as follows:

 <p>    Drucker scoffs at the notion of knowledge management. 'You can't
     manage knowledge,' he says. 'Knowledge is between two ears, and
     only between two ears.' To that extent, Drucker says it's really
     about what individual workers do with the knowledge they have. When
     employees leave a company, he says, their knowledge goes with them,
     no matter how much they've shared.

 <p>  Frank Miller, another independent consultant, working in Australia,
   and with an invited paper in this issue of Information Research,
   agrees. In the original version of the paper, available on his Web
   site he says:

 <p>    ...knowledge is the uniquely human capability of making meaning
     from information - ideally in relationships with other human
     beings...'
     Knowledge is, after all, what we know. And what we know can't be
     commodified. Perhaps if we didn't have the word 'knowledge' and
     were constrained to say 'what I know', the notion of 'knowledge
     capture' would be seen for what it is - nonsense! (Miller, 2000)

 <p>  These, however, are very much individual views. What corporate view of
   'knowledge management' is presented by the major consultancy
   companies?

  <h>Accenture

 <p>  Accenture is the former Andersen Consulting: its strengths have long
   been in the area of information technology management, so it is no
   surprise to find 'knowledge management' equated mainly with
   information technology. For example, Lotus Software is identified as a
   partner and the description reads:

  <p>   This Knowledge Management solution provider enables workers to
     capture, manage and share information throughout their
     organizations. 

 <p>  which neatly demonstrates the use of 'knowledge' as a synonym for
   'information'. Elsewhere on the site, 'knowledge management' is
   defined as:

 <p>    ensuring that the right information is available in an easily
     digestible format to employees across the organization at the point
     of need so they can leverage experiences and make more effective
     business decisions. 

  <p> which, to this author, reads very much like a 1970s definition of
   information management.

<h>  Cap Gemini Ernst and Young

 <p>  The management consultancy arm of Ernst and Young was bought in 2000
   by the French group, Cap Gemini, to form Cap Gemini Ernst and Young.
   In this company, 'knowledge management' appears to be equated with the
   management of 'intellectual capital' (Loudes, 1999) and this, in turn,
   means, for example:

 <l>    encouraging information exchange among staff, for example, through
   formal and informal networking following training;

 <l>    building intranets to provide access to information resources;

 <l>    creating 'yellow pages' or indexes to expertise; and

  <l>   creating newsgroups for employees to encourage information exchange.

 <p>  In other words, at CGEY, 'knowledge management' is information
   management.

 <h> Deloitte and Touche

<p>   Deloitte and Touch promote 'knowledge management' (Eyler, 2001) under
   a definition provided by another consultancy, the Gartner Group:

 <p>    Knowledge management is a discipline that promotes an integrated
     approach to the creation, capture, organization, access, and use of
     an enterprise's information assets. These assets include structured
     databases, textual information such as policy and procedure
     documents, and most importantly, the tacit knowledge and expertise
     resident in the heads of individual employees.

<p>   which quite clearly proposes 'knowledge' as a synonym for
   'information'. The idea of 'tacit knowledge' will be dealt with later.

 <p>  The company clearly views 'knowledge management' as amenable to
   technical solutions, claiming that:

<p>     Deloitte Consulting provides system consulting and implementation
     services for knowledge management solutions in a wide range of
     applications and scales. The solutions include data warehouse
     systems, enterprise system integration (data exchange system) with
     middleware, and workflow or document management systems with
     groupware such as Lotus Notes/Domino. (Eyler, 2001)

 <h> Ernst and Young

 <p>  This company's main concern appears to be in the application of
   'knowledge management' to its own business: I could find no
   publications or site locations that promoted 'knowledge management'
   services other than e-learning. Internally, 'knowledge management' is
   translated as information sharing among Ernst and Young staff around
   the world (although it is called, of course, 'knowledge sharing') ,
   and the provision of business intelligence to clients. These
   activities are supported by a network of 'Centers for Business
   Knowledge', which appear to be a combination of the traditional
   company library and information service, plus specialised services
   such as statistical analysis and financial benchmarking. Thus,
   although the rhetoric is about 'knowledge', the reality is about
   information, its organization and transfer.

 <h> KPMG Consulting

<p>   It seems that, at one time, KPMG had a 'knowledge management
   practice', but all trace of this appears to have disappeared from the
   site, except in descriptions of the authors of certain documents. It
   appears that KPMG thinks that there is more to be gained by 'leverage
   intellectual assets' and by drawing attention to the concept of
   'intellectual property' and the 'hidden value' of such property. For
   example, a recent report, Intellectual gold, defines intellectual
   property as:

 <p>    not just patents, trade marks, copyrights, database rights and
     other "pure" IP, but other forms of articulated knowledge, such as
     business processes, methodologies and know how. (KPMG, 2002)

 <p>  It may well be that KPMG has reached the conclusion that the area of
   intellectual property, broadly defined, offers more opportunity for
   income growth than the rather less well defined idea of 'knowledge
   management'.

 <h> McKinsey and Company

<p>   McKinsey and co. do not have a significant representation of the idea
   of 'knowledge management' on their site. Most of the entries in the
   search results refer to the content of McKinsey Quarterly as a source
   of information on 'the world of knowledge'. Apart from this, the
   employment pages refer to job opportunities in the sector of
   'Knowledge management and research', where roles such as 'Research
   analyst' and 'Knowledge specialist' are identified. A typical
   'research analyst' job description begins:

 <p>    'The Insurance Research Analyst will assist teams by collecting,
     summarizing, analyzing, and synthesizing facts that serve as
     critical inputs to client service teams, interpreting their
     findings into implications for teams.'

<p>   which seems like a straightforward information analysis job. The
   'knowledge specialist' role is somewhat more diverse, but includes a
   number of tasks that would be familiar to anyone working under a title
   such as 'information officer':

 <p>    'Participate in the Practice's knowledge capture and codification
     program by sourcing internal knowledge and experts; develop topical
     material relevant for internal and client related activities.
     Enhance the ability of client teams to access internal knowledge
     and experts, advise client teams on the application of practice
     knowledge and expertise; provide hands-on guidance for teams
     without prior experience in the financial services industry.
     Build and maintain "self-service" tools/databases for consultants
     and research professionals to access knowledge, including intranet
     sites.
 <p>    Maintain the Practice's knowledge databases and tools for internal
     knowledge codification and storage. Provide ad hoc support to the
     Practice's leaders for internal knowledge sharing meetings,
     performance metrics and other practice events/activities.'

<p>   It can be seen that 'knowledge' is being used as a synonym for
   'information'.

 <h> PricewaterhouseCoopers

 <p>  PwC's global Web site has a number of pages devoted to two books
   written by PwC staff: The knowledge management fieldbook, by Bukowitz
   and Williams (1999a) and Knowledge management - a guide to good
   practice, by Kelleher and Levene (2001). An extract from the first of
   these (called, rather amusingly coincidentally in view of the above
   figure, 'Looking through the knowledge glass') appears on the Web site
   of CIO Enterprise Magazine (1999). The extract is written in typical
   'management consultancy speak', which cannot hide the fact that most
   of the time 'knowledge' is simply a synonym for information. On the
   same page there is an interview with the authors, where the confusion
   of the two words increases:

 <p>    Some early KM theorists hoped that somehow if we instituted
     knowledge management repositories, places to capture information,
     we really wouldn't need that middle manager level.

 <p>  Comment becomes unnecessary at this point.

 <p>  However, the main area of the PwC business under which 'knowledge
   management' now falls appears to be the 'Intellectual Asset Management
   Practice' (to which Bukowitz and Williams belong). Most of the work in
   this practice appears to deal with issues such as licensing (both into
   companies and out of companies) and intellectual asset aspects of
   mergers and acquisitions and security. The site previously devoted to
   the Knowledge Management Practice appears no longer to exist, since a
   search for known documents using the search facility at
   www.pwcglobal.com revealed nothing. However, some papers are still
   available.

 <p>  In particular, there is an issue of the house journal Investment
   Management Perspectives which contains eight papers on various aspects
   of 'knowledge management'. The first (Yu, 2000), has a section headed,
   'What is knowledge management?', which then fails to define it - there
   is a good deal on what 'knowledge' is and about what it is important
   to include in a 'knowledge management' programme, but no definition.
   There is also the usual confusion between 'tacit knowledge' and what
   we might call 'expressible but previously unexpressed' or implicit
   knowledge. The other papers deal with the problem of measuring the
   success of a knowledge management programme, but there is no
   definition of knowledge that distinguishes it from information, and
   the cases explored appear to be cases of information management rather
   than 'knowledge management' (Petrash, 2000). Similar problems plague
   the remaining papers - they deal with interesting topics, such as
   information sharing and the role of information technology, but they
   lack any coherent theoretical basis upon which to base any conception
   of 'knowledge management'.

<p>   PwC has now been bought by IBM, thereby tying the consultancy even
   more closely to hardware and software selling.

 <h>   Conclusion on the consultancies.

<p>   The conclusion to this brief exploration of consultancy Web sites is
   that 'knowledge management' means different things to different
   companies and that one or two of them that have previously dabbled
   with the idea have moved on to other things.

<p>   Some of the consultancies covered claim that companies are flocking to
   them to discover the joys of 'knowledge management'. However, since
   1993, Bain and Company have been tracking the use of various
   management tools and according to their latest survey covering the
   year 2000 (Bain & Company, 2001) only about 35% of their world-wide
   sample of 451 companies was using 'knowledge management', reporting a
   satisfaction rating of about 3.5 on a five-point scale. The usage
   figure puts 'knowledge management' in 19th position, out of 25
   management tools. This compares with about 70% using benchmarking, and
   almost 80% using strategic planning. The Bain survey suggests that the
   flood may be more of a trickle.

<h>  The view from the business schools

 <p>  Similar difficulties of definition and distinction seem to exist in
   the business schools: for example, the course on 'knowledge
   management' at the Stuart Graduate School of Business at Illinois
   Institute of Technology is part of the information management stream
   and covers:

 <p>    Basic concepts of intelligent systems for improving business
     decision-making. Topics include opportunity/problem identification,
     data mining, visual model building, expert systems, neural networks
     and their successful implementation. Students will build prototype
     knowledge-based systems using commercial software. Case studies
     address knowledge management system implementation and benefit
     measurement challenges.

 <p>  So, here: 'knowledge management' is equated, essentially, with expert
   systems for decision support and related software technologies.

  <p> At the George Mason University School of Management, 'knowledge
   management' is part of the information systems management stream and
   the relevant course is described as follows:

  <p>   Examines the firms that use knowledge management principles and
     approaches: intellectual capital, human capital, customer capital,
     tacit and explicit knowledge, the new role of the Chief Knowledge
     Officer, leveraging of knowledge management.

 <p>  This is not particularly helpful in terms of definition and the
   detailed syllabus presents something of a hodge-podge of topics, with
   no clear distinction offered between 'information' and 'knowledge'.
   The structure of the course has no readily apparent logic and the
   description of Week 1 as presenting a 'collage overview', seems to
   apply to the entire course.

 <p>  In the University of Kentucky's Gattan College of Business and
   Economics, the Kentucky Initiative for Knowledge Management notes:

 <p>    A variety of computer-based techniques for managing knowledge
     (i.e., representing and processing it) have been and will continue
     to be devised to supplement innate human knowledge management
     skills.

 <p>  and 'knowledge management' is then defined as being concerned with:

 <p>    the invention, improvement, integration, usage, administration,
     evaluation, and impacts of such techniques.

<p>   Of course, as we have seen, only information can be 'represented and
   processed' by computers, so this initiative is concerned with
   information systems under another name; presumably one with public
   relations significance.

 <p>  At the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at
   Austin, 'knowledge management' is part of the information management
   concentration in the MBA, with one core course on 'Managing
   information', The description notes:

<p>     A sample of the topics covered in the course includes business
     intelligence; knowledge management; knowledge-worker productivity,
     data modeling, and group decision support systems.

<p>   which looks like a very cursory nod in the direction of 'knowledge
   management'. There is also an elective course on 'Information and
   knowledge management', with no detailed description.

 <p>  Georgetown University, Washington DC is one of the most prestigious
   universities in the USA and its MBA programme has an elective course
   in 'Technology and Knowledge Management', which:

 <p>    'provides a managerial perspective on the effective use of
     information technology for strategic advantage and operational
     performance in global organizations through case analyses and class
     discussion. Topics include: information technology's relationship
     to business competition and strategy; the business value of
     information systems; the use of information systems to enhance
     decision-making, communication, and knowledge use in organizations;
     using information technology to redesign business processes; the
     ways information systems can add value to products and services;
     and the organizational, social, and ethical issues arising from
     information technologies.'

<p>   The information systems orientation is clear.

 <p>  At the Robert H. Smith School of Business, the University of Maryland,
   the Center for Knowledge & Information Management,

 <p>    'focuses on research dealing with the transformation of business
     practices through information technology, and the creation,
     management, and deployment of knowledge and information.'

 <p>  Very little additional information is available, since the relevant
   links appear to be 'dead', but from what can be found, the information
   technology orientation is obvious.

 <p>  At the Harvard Business School, 'knowledge management' figures in part
   of a course on "General Management: Processes and Action", with the
   module title, 'Organization Learning and Knowledge Management
   Processes'. The description makes the intention clear:

 <p>    Learning processes determine how individuals and organizations
     create, acquire, interpret, transfer, and retain knowledge; they
     too may take a variety of forms. The approaches examined in this
     module include experimentation, benchmarking, and learning from
     past successes and failures.

<p>   Here, 'organization learning' is re-badged as 'knowledge management'.
   This appears to be the only course at the School that deals with the
   subject.

 <p>  The Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania is
   another prestigious institution in the USA. Although its site has a
   number of 'knowledge management' links, the subject does not appear to
   feature in the MBA programme. It does, on the other hand, have what
   appears to be a very soundly based course on, 'Information: Strategy,
   Systems, and Economics':

<p>     Understanding the strategic aspects of information and information
     management is being transformed; what were once skills of
     specialized technologists are now critical aspects of the
     preparation of all executives. This major will prepare students for
     careers in consulting and venture capital, and for senior
     management positions in a wide range of industries already being
     transformed by the interacting forces of information,
     globalization, and deregulation.

<p>   No hyperbolae about 'knowledge management' here.

 <p>  'Knowledge management' does not appear in the syllabus of the MBA at
   the London Business School although a seminar is offered at the
   Doctoral level. At the Manchester Business School, a Google search on
   the site revealed no information on courses on 'knowledge management'
   in the MBA programme, and the subject does not appear in the lists of
   core and elective courses.

<p>   The Said Business School at Oxford University appears to have no core
   or elective course in 'knowledge management' in its MBA programme'
   However, one of the core courses, 'People and organizations' includes
   "managing knowledge and change', and 'Managing knowledge-based
   organizations' has been offered as an elective.

 <p>  At the Cass Business School, City University, London, there are about
   twenty links to 'knowledge management' on the site, but none link to
   core or elective courses in the MBA programme. Most of them link to
   research topics: for example, a team working on 'Operations management
   and quantitative analysis', refer to 'Information and knowledge
   management - model building skills, management learning', as a key
   topic. The usual confusion between 'information' and 'knowledge' can
   be seen: the main paragraph on this page refers to 'applying
   innovative systems thinking and information management to improve
   business performance and learning.'

<p>   Warwick University Business School, which is another leading UK
   institution and the joint home (the other institution is the
   University of Oxford) of the ESRC Centre on Skills, Knowledge and
   Organizational Performance, does not have a course on 'knowledge
   management' in its MBA programme. It does, however, have a course on
   'information management'.

<p>  One's overall impression, from this review of business school sites is
   that the most prestigious steer well away from 'knowledge management',
   other than in the statements of interest of faculty. Nor does the
   subject appear to enter significantly into the teaching programmes.
   The sites often include documents in the form of reports, working
   papers, or draft papers and these reveal the same difficulties with
   the concept as shown in the review of journals.

<h>'Search and replace marketing'

<p>   The review of journal papers, the review of consultancy Web sites and
   those of the business schools, suggest that, in many cases, 'knowledge
   management' is being used simply as a synonym for 'information
   management'. This has been referred to by David Weinberger, citing
   Adina Levin as the originator, as 'search and replace marketing' in
   reporting the KM Summit of 1998:

 <p>    'Andy Moore, editor of KM World and the event's genial host, asked
     the group how you reply to a customer who says, "Isn't this just
     search-and-replace marketing?" That is, do you become a KM vendor
     simply by taking your old marketing literature and doing a search
     and replace, changing, say, "information retrieval" into "KM"? The
     question rattled the group. Answers sputtered forth. This was
     obviously a sore subject. It seems to me that there are three
     possible answers to the question "Is this search-and-replace
     marketing?" given that this question expresses customer pain and
     suspicion:
 <l>   1. No, we've added important new features designed to help you with
       your KM chores.
 <l>   2. Sort of. We have the same features as always but have discovered
       new applications for them.
  <l>  3. Yes, you pathetic loser.

  <p>   The first two answers are perfectly acceptable. The third is
     perhaps a tad too honest to make it in this imperfect world,
     although undoubtedly there is some "kewl" company that is
     contemplating using this as the center of its advertising campaign.
     ("Companies will love that we're being so upfront with them,
     man.")' (Weinberger, 1998)

 <p>  The software industry has become particularly prone to search and
   replace marketing, with almost everything from e-mail systems to Lotus
   Notes groupware being re-branded as 'knowledge management' software.

 <p>  The same re-branding can be found in other places. Once upon a time
   the excellent business research site, www.brint.com, had a large
   section devoted to information management but, in 1999, if I remember
   aright, I wanted to locate something I had previously found there and
   used my hot-link, with no result. Eventually, I found that everything
   that had previously been located under 'information management' was
   now identified as 'knowledge management' and brint.com was claiming to
   be the Web's best site for information on the subject.

<p>   As noted above, the confusion of 'knowledge' as a synonym for
   'information' is one of the most common effects of the 'knowledge
   management' fad. The World Bank site (of which more below) used to
   carry a document by the former head of 'knowledge management', Stephen
   Denning, which is now available on Denning's own site. The following
   piece is taken from that paper:

 <p>    The reach of the new technology for information sharing: Many
     factors have transformed the way in which organizations now view
     information, but perhaps the pivotal development has been the
     dramatically extended reach of know-how through new information
     technology. Rapidly falling costs of communications and computing
     and the extraordinary growth and accessibility of the World Wide
     Web present new opportunities for information-based organizations,
     to share knowledge more widely and cheaply than ever before. Thus
     organizations with operations and employees around the world are
     now able to mobilize their expertise from whatever origin to apply
     rapidly to new situations. As a result, clients are coming to
     expect from global organizations, not merely the know-how of the
     particular team that has been assigned to the task, but the very
     best that the organization as a whole has to offer. Information
     sharing is thus enabling - and forcing - institutions that are
     international in the scope of their operations, to become truly
     global in character by enabling information transfer to occur
     across large distances within a very short time. (Denning, 1998)

 <p>  However, I have changed all of the occurrences of 'knowledge' to
   'information' and, as far as I can see, it makes no difference at all
   to the sense of the piece.

<p>   The 'search and replace' strategy is also seen in action in KPMG
   Consulting's (2000) report on 'knowledge management'. The report
   notes:

 <p>    Companies still see knowledge management as a purely technology
     solution
     Organisations have adopted a number of relevant technologies for KM
     purposes. 93% of respondents used the Internet to access external
     knowledge, 78% used an intranet, 63% used data warehousing or
     mining technologies, 61% document management systems, 49% decision
     support, 43% groupware and 38% extranets. (KPMG Consulting, 2000: 3

 <p>  All of the technologies mentioned, of course, are information handling
   systems or database technologies, but for the purposes of the
   exercise, they are re-named 'relevant technologies for KM purposes'

<p>   Finally, international organizations are not protected from the lure
   of 'knowledge management'. The European Union's Fifth Framework
   Programme made great play with the concept of 'the Information
   Society'; however, when the Sixth Framework Programme was announced
   all the material that formerly appeared under the heading of 'the
   Information Society' appeared under the new heading - 'the Knowledge
   Society'! No conceptual differences - just search and replace
   marketing.

<h>Tacit knowledge

<p>   Mention has been made more than once of the idea of 'tacit knowledge'
   and the idea of 'capturing' such knowledge is often presented as
   central to 'knowledge management'. However, what is 'tacit knowledge'?
   The term originates with Polanyi (1958), chemist turned philosopher of
   science, and has been described as:

  <p>   'the idea that certain cognitive processes and/or behaviors are
     undergirded by operations inaccessible to consciousness' (Barbiero,
     n.d.)

 <p>  This is the key point about Polanyi's concept: 'tacit' means 'hidden',
   tacit knowledge is hidden knowledge, hidden even from the
   consciousness of the knower. This is why Polanyi used the phrase 'We
   know more than we can tell.' A phrase parroted even by those who
   mis-use the idea and believe that this hidden knowledge, inaccessible
   to the consciousness of the knower, can somehow be 'captured'.

 <p>  Polanyi equates tacit knowledge with 'acts of comprehension':

 <p>    'tacit knowing achieves comprehension by indwelling, and... all
     knowledge consists of or is rooted in such acts of comprehension'
     (Polanyi, 1958)

 <p>  In other words, 'tacit knowledge' involves the process of
   comprehension, a process which is, itself, little understood.
   Consequently, tacit knowledge is an inexpressible process that enables
   an assessment of phenomena in the course of becoming knowledgeable
   about the world. In what sense, then, can it be captured? The answer,
   of course, is that it cannot be 'captured' - it can only be
   demonstrated through our expressible knowledge and through our acts.

<p>   How did the idea that tacit knowledge could be 'captured' arise? The
   guilty party appears to be Nonaka, (1991) and Nonaka and Takeuchi
   (1995), who appear to have either misunderstood Polanyi's work, or
   deliberately distorted it to enable them to construct the well-known
   two-by-two diagram.


<p>   Having cited Polanyi as the source of the idea of 'tacit knowledge'
   and having noted that Polanyi refers to the process of 'indwelling',
   whereby people create knowledge of the world around them, Nonaka and
   Takeuchi go on to state that:

<p>     While Polanyi argues the contents for tacit knowledge further in a
     philosophic context, it is also possible to expand his idea [my
     emphasis] in a more practical direction. (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995:
     60)

<p>   They then note that:

<p>     Mental models, such as schemata, paradigms, perspectives, beliefs
     and viewpoints help individuals to perceive and define their world.
     (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995: 60)

<p>   and include such models within tacit knowledge. However, if such
   models can be expressed by the person they constitute not tacit
   knowledge, which, as noted earlier, is inexpressible, but expressible
   knowledge, which, when expressed, becomes information. Such previously
   unexpressed but expressible knowledge may be termed 'implicit'
   knowledge.

 <p>  In fact, the example cited by Nonaka & Takeuchi (1995:63-64) makes it
   clear that implicit knowledge is being talked about here. The case of
   bread-making is discussed and the fact that the head baker of the
   Osaka International Hotel twisted the dough as well as stretching it,
   is given as an example of 'tacit' knowledge - but no-one appears to
   have asked the baker how he made the bread! I have no doubt that (as a
   bread-maker myself) that he would have been able to describe his
   bread-making process in detail, including the process of twisting. The
   approach appears to be, "If I see something I hadn't noticed before,
   or knew of before, then those actions, or whatever, must constitute
   tacit knowledge." As a research approach this is somewhat lacking, nor
   is it very helpful as a guide to discovering practice. One must also
   bear in mind the cultural context of this example: I asked a Japanese
   colleague whether someone acting the role of apprentice in Japan would
   think of questioning the 'master' and, of course, she shook her head
   and smiled. The 'apprentices' in the example would never have thought
   of asking.

 <p>  Nonaka and Takeuchi put forward the proposition, embodied in the
   diagram, that 'tacit knowledge' is somehow derived from explicit
   knowledge and, by other means, is made explicit. However, it is clear,
   from the analysis above, that implicit knowledge, which is not
   normally expressed, but may be expressed, is actually intended here.
   Implicit knowledge is that which we take for granted in our actions,
   and which may be shared by others through common experience or
   culture. For example, in establishing a production facility in a
   foreign country, a company knows it needs to acquire local knowledge
   of 'how things are done here'. Such knowledge may not be written down,
   but is known by people living and working in the culture and is
   capable of being written down, or otherwise conveyed to those who need
   to know. The knowledge is implicit in the way people behave towards
   one another, and towards authority, in that foreign culture, and the
   appropriate norms of behaviour can be taught to the newcomers.
   Implicit knowledge, in other words, is expressible: tacit knowledge is
   not, and Nonaka would have saved a great deal of confusion had he
   chosen the more appropriate term. The critical reader might ask
   him/herself: 'Does it make any difference to the argument if, in the
   diagram, we replace "tacit knowledge" with "knowledge" and "explicit
   knowledge" with "information"?'

<h>The people perspective

<p>   The literature of 'knowledge management' claims that the 'people'
   dimension is more important than the technological (in spite of the
   fact that most of the same literature is heavily oriented towards
   technology use). As noted earlier, Sveiby (2001a) holds that the
   'management of people' is one of the two tracks of 'knowledge
   management', and the work of the World Bank is held up by a number of
   writers as evidence for the power of the 'people management' track of
   'knowledge management'.

<p>   However, when we examine the World Bank's 'knowledge management'
   strategy, the reality (as with the technology track) bears little
   relation to the rhetoric. The 'vision' of the World Bank is that it
   should become not simply a financial agency but the world's 'Knowledge
   Bank'.

  <p> With the retirement of Stephen Denning as head of the Bank's
   'knowledge management' initiative, and his re-emergence as a
   'knowledge management' consultant (see, http://www.stevedenning.com/),
   the Bank has re-thought its strategy and removed the earlier
   documents. The rhetoric is no longer about 'knowledge management', but
   about 'knowledge sharing'. The new initiative as described by the
   Bank's Managing Director, Mamphela Ramphele (2002) still has four
   elements, but these are now expressed as follows:

  <l>   * The first, is fostering policy, regulatory, and network readiness,
       by supporting the development of an adequate enabling environment
       for efficiency, competition, and innovation in knowledge sharing,
       and development of information and communication technologies.
 <l>    * The second element focuses on building human capacity for the
       knowledge economy, by promoting excellence in education, from the
       basic to the tertiary level, as well as the new skills needed for
       information and communication technologies. Associated activities
       include work towards getting schools, classrooms, and libraries
       online, and promoting development of innovative approaches that
       extend the reach of education and training, such as distance
       learning, community-based training, and networking of educational
       institutions.
  <l>   * The third element of the strategy focuses on continued efforts to
       expand basic connectivity and access, and invest in information
       technology applications. Key activities include mobilizing
       resources to improve information infrastructure, working on ways
       to reduce the cost of connectivity, supporting community access
       programs, and developing local content and entrepreneurial
       information technology opportunities.
  <l>   * The final key element of the strategy is focused on promoting the
       generation and sharing of global knowledge, through support for
       knowledge networking, global research, and communities of
       practice. This will focus on creating and applying the knowledge
       necessary to stimulate and facilitate the transition to the
       knowledge economy-as well as the knowledge necessary to reap its
       full economic, social, and cultural benefits.

<p>   In fact, these are almost identical to the original four, the second
   and third have the same titles. The focus continues to be heavily
   technology-oriented and one might be forgiven for imagining that the
   real aim of the World Bank is to help U.S.-based global industries to
   sell more hardware and software to the developing world. Given that
   the Bank is located in Washington, D.C., where one of the biggest
   industries is the lobby industry, this would not be surprising.

<p>   Another 'knowledge management' legend, promulgated by Davenport (1997)
   is that Microsoft has a 'knowledge management' strategy. What does
   this turn out to be?

<p>     The knowledge base for Microsoft IT must always be current.
     Therefore, the IT group has focused heavily on the issue of
     identifying and maintaining knowledge competencies.

<p>   In other words, this 'knowledge management strategy' is a training
   programme. Of course, it is wrapped up in the jargon of the day:

 <p>    'The project, called Skills Planning "und" Development (thus
     affectionately known as "SPUD") is focused not on entry level
     competencies, but rather on those needed and acquired to stay on
     the leading edge of the workplace.'

   and

  <l>   'Development of a structure of competency types and levels;
   <l>   Defining the competencies required for particular jobs;
     <l>  * Rating the performance of individual employees in particular jobs
       based on the competencies;
   <l>      * Implementing the knowledge competencies in an online system;
   <l>      * Linkage of the competency model to learning offerings.'

<p>   However, a training programme remains a training programme and the
   fact that a high-technology company like Microsoft needs knowledgeable
   people and needs to maintain their knowledge bases hardly seems
   remarkable.

<p>   There is more to the 'people perspective' than the efforts of the
   World Bank, of course. The principal aim of this arm of 'knowledge
   management' is to improve the sharing of information in organizations
   and one of the chief ways in which this is attempted is by encouraging
   personal networking and the development of 'communities of practice'.

 <p>  Lesser and Storck (2001), in a paper referred to earlier, in the
   analysis of journal papers, and citing a paper by Storck and Hill
   (2000), draw attention to the difference between teams and communities
   of practice:

 <p>    Team relationships are established when the organization assigns
   people to be team members. Community relationships are formed around
   practice.

 <p>    Similarly, authority relationships within the team are
   organizationally determined. Authority relationships in a community of
   practice emerge through interaction around expertise.

  <p>   Teams have goals, which are often established by people not on the
   team. Communities are only responsible to their members.

 <p>    Teams rely on work and reporting processes that are organizationally
   defined. Communities develop their own processes.

<p>   Of course these distinctions would be meaningful if organizations were
   structured in such a way as to encourage the creation of 'communities'
   in which members owed allegiance only to one another and had the
   autonomy to develop their own ways of working. Expertise might well
   then be shared. However, organizations are not like this and business
   organizations in particular are certainly not always like this.
   Business organizations (especially public companies) are generally
   driven by the idea of 'shareholder value', which emphasises short-term
   strategies that are likely to increase the share value. Chief of these
   strategies are those that seek cost savings, leading often to a rather
   blinkered choice of the reduction of staff to achieve savings. Coupled
   with the kind of corporate misgovernance that we have seen in the
   cases of Enron, WorldCom, and others, one must doubt that business
   organizations are busy building the kind of corporate cultures that
   will actually encourage 'communities of practice'

<h>Conclusion

 <p>  The inescapable conclusion of this analysis of the 'knowledge
   management' idea is that it is, in large part, a management fad,
   promulgated mainly by certain consultancy companies, and the
   probability is that it will fade away like previous fads. It rests on
   two foundations: the management of information - where a large part of
   the fad exists (and where the 'search and replace marketing'
   phenomenon is found), and the effective management of work practices.
   However, these latter practices are predicated upon a Utopian idea of
   organizational culture in which the benefits of information exchange
   are shared by all, where individuals are given autonomy in the
   development of their expertise, and where 'communities' within the
   organization can determine how that expertise will be used. Sadly, we
   are a long way removed from that Utopia: whatever businesses claim
   about people being their most important resource, they are never
   reluctant to rid themselves of that resource (and the knowledge it
   possesses) when market conditions decline. In the U.K. we can point to
   British Airways, which, in the aftermath of the terrorist attack of
   the 11th September 2001, paid off more than 7,000 of its 'knowledge
   resources' - financial observers suggested that they were simply
   waiting for a suitable excuse to do so, management having taken
   disastrous business decisions which had reduced profitability. We can
   also point to Barclays Bank, with profits of more than Â£2 billion in
   2001 and profit growth that year of almost 3.0%, which, nevertheless,
   paid off some 10% of its total global workforce. No imagination
   appears to have been used by either of these companies to determine
   ways in which their 'most important resource' might be more
   effectively employed to increase turnover and profits.

<p>   The two companies mentioned are not atypical and we have to ask, 'If
   getting promotion, or holding your job, or finding a new one is based
   on the knowledge you possess - what incentive is there to reveal that
   knowledge and share it?'

 <p>  This is not to say that enabling people to contribute effectively to
   the management of organizations is impossible and that sharing
   knowledge and enabling people to use their creativity in innovative
   ways in organizations is impossible - simply that it is very
   difficult, and that it does not reduce to some simplistic concept of
   'knowledge management'! It demands a change in business culture, from
   the macho Harvard Business School model, to something more thoughtful
   and understanding of what motivates human beings. Organizations need
   to learn to think about problems, rather than grab at proffered
   'solutions' - which often turn out to be expensive side-tracks away
   from the main issues. For example, if you have a poorly-rewarded and,
   hence, poor sales force, no amount of data warehousing (another
   so-called 'knowledge management' tool) is going to give you good
   customer relations.

 <p>  A reasonable question to ask, at this stage, is, 'Why now?'. Why has
   'knowledge management' achieved such a fashionable status is the
   business world? This question was asked on the KNOW-ORG mailing list
   and my response was as follows:

 <p>    First, and largely because of a fixation on internal organizational
     data, the term 'information' has become almost synonymous with data
     in the minds of organizational heads. For example, I've been told
     that the National Electronic Library for Health uses the term
     'Knowledge' because in the NHS information=data and a different
     term was needed. We have to lay this, I think, at the feet of the
     information systems profession whose focus for years was data and
     data definitions, etc. In fact, they dealt not with information
     systems but with data systems.
<p>     Secondly, and opportunely for the software houses and IT firms,
     'km' came along just as they were being hit by the wave of
     scepticism over the possibility of IT ever delivering more than
     problems - and certainly never likely to deliver productivity and
     performance. 'Whoops, we've cracked it!' cried the IBMs and MSofts
     of this world - 'We should have been dealing with 'knowledge' all
     along, and now we are - Lotus Notes is no longer groupware and
     personal information management, it's KnowledgeWare!' So they are
     happily marketing the same product under a new name.
<p>     Thirdly, the organization and management boys finally began to
     realise that all this text that people were creating on
     word-processors, etc., needed to be managed effectively and,
     indeed, organized, shared and disseminated more effectively, but
     they couldn't use 'information management' because that was
     'information systems' and data, wasn't it? So it must be
     'knowledge', right? If we can only get people to share their
     'knowledge' performance must improve because it is the
     communication barriers that are preventing the free flow of
     'knowledge' (i.e., information). So, now, every aspect of
     organization and management theory has to have a 'knowledge'
     dimension, otherwise you aren't in the game. In the literature, of
     course, this amounts to the token use of the term 'knowledge
     management' and the use of 'knowledge' as a synonym for
     'information'.
 <p>    Fourthly, at the forefront of all this were the management
     consultancies - why? Because BPR and Organizational Learning were
     running out of steam. Amusingly, all organizational learning work
     appears to come under the heading of 'km' - more search and replace
     marketing. So, the consultancies grabbed at km in order to have
     something to sell at the end of the 90s.
<p>     Finally, most (or at least many) departments of information
     management or information science, and departments of information
     systems in academia, are somewhat low on the totem pole in most of
     their institutions, and each needs to differentiate itself from the
     other in order to try to work its way up that greasy pole, so both
     have seized on km as an aid in the struggle. I foresee turf-wars
     over which department, where there is one of each, has the right to
     run degrees in km. Where only one of the kind exists, it will seek
     to make km all-embracing of management, computer science,
     information systems, etc., etc. - because the logic leads nowhere
     else :-) 'If WE deal with knowledge - then how can anyone else
     presume to do so?' (Wilson, 2001)

 <p>  I see no reason to change my opinions as a result of the analysis
   carried out for this paper, but I would add that, according to the
   rhetoric of 'knowledge management', 'mind' becomes 'manageable', the
   content of mind can be captured or down-loaded and the accountant's
   dream of people-free production, distribution and sales is realized -
   'knowledge' is now in the database, recoverable at any time. That may
   be Utopia for some, but not for many. Fortunately, like most Utopias,
   it cannot be realized.

<p>   This analysis of 'knowledge management' may not have much significance
   to the world of business practice, where the academic literature is
   rarely read unless filtered through the 'airport book'. One might
   argue that for information practitioners to call themselves (or for
   the organization to call them) 'Knowledge Managers' does no harm and
   may do some good, in terms of giving a higher profile to their role
   (even if a number of them are rather embarrassed by the title).
   However, the aim of the university and of those who work for it is to
   expose ideas to critical analysis and to inculcate in students the
   same abilities. It is, perhaps, a sad reflection on the way in which
   the university, world-wide, has changed from the 'temple' to the
   'factory' (Beckman, 1989) that so many academics are prepared to jump
   on the bandwagon - one's only satisfaction is that the bandwagon lacks
   wheels.
