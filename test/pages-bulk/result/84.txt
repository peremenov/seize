     <h> Whose Beowulf is it anyway? Review by William Kilbride 

    <h>   'Beowulf? .... that's by Seamus Heaney. Sorry we're sold out.'

  <p>  It is hardly surprising that Heaney's new translation of Beowulf
   should seem like a completely new work. It has been a very long time
   since Grendel's mother was on the archaeology reading list, let alone
   among the best sellers. The new translation has a parallel, less
   popular but in many respects more interesting, product from the
   British Library in the shape of Electronic Beowulf, a CD-Rom (or two)
   which provides virtual access to the medieval manuscript itself.

  <p>  Access to information is a modern zeitgeist. The British Library's
   Electronic Beowulf is part of a programme that will bring us the
   digital Gutenburg Bible, the electronic Magna Carta and many more.
   Similar projects at the Public Records Office promise to provide
   'Access to Archives'. The Heritage Lottery Fund  and the New
   Opportunities Fund  both now fund digitisation projects, the
   latter spending 50 million UKP specifically to make information
   accessible on the Internet. These initiatives are not formulated in
   isolation, but form parts of wider social and economic policies. UK
   government policy on information aims to use this investment not
   simply to disseminate information, but, we are told:

   <p>   "The Government has a mission to modernise - renewing our country
     for the new millennium. We are modernising our schools, our
     hospitals, our economy and our criminal justice system. We are
     modernising our democratic framework"
     (Tony Blair, foreword to HMSO 1999).

 <p>   Allied to this, ambitious policies to combat 'social exclusion' have
   accentuated wider issues of social and cultural regeneration, with
   emphasis being placed on the culture and heritage sectors as a means
   of engaging actively with groups disenfranchised by conventional
   social and economic policies (e.g. SEU 2000). Cultural engagement for
   social regeneration is paralleled by a recognition of the importance
   of new technologies in the economy, represented by exercises such as
   the Department of Trade and Industry's "UK online for business"
   programme. Investment in digital infrastructures will provide the
   foundations for a wider economic engagement, raising standards in IT
   skills, and providing a platform from which business can expand its
   use of communications technologies. For many years governments have
   supported industry with the infrastructure of roads, railways and
   ports. In the 'information age' the 'knowledge economy' will receive a
   similar sort of investment. This, at least is the political theory of
   community building on the Internet.

  <p>  This rhetoric is all well and good, but it seems to take us a long way
   from Electronic Beowulf. The point is, however, that Electronic
   Beowulf provides an early taste of what is to come. Once NOF, HLF and
   everyone else have spent their millions, then there's no question that
   the review pages of Internet Archaeology will be stuffed with virtual
   galleries, virtual museums, virtual worlds, virtually everything. Does
   Electronic Beowulf, support this rhetoric of access and inclusion?

  <p>  The history of the text of Beowulf is almost as dramatic as the
   adventure it narrates. The earliest manuscript (perhaps) belongs to
   the 11th century. After the dissolution of the monasteries, it came
   into the possession of Laurence Nowell. It was acquired in the 17th
   century by Robert Cotton, who donated it to the state in 1700. The
   manuscript survived fire in 1731, before being moved to the British
   Museum on its foundation in 1753. The charred and disintegrating
   remains of the manuscript were studied by the Danish scholar, G.J.
   Thorkelin, whose library was wrecked and papers destroyed by the Royal
   Navy in 1807 during the siege of Copenhagen. Collations in 1817 and
   1824 demonstrate the manuscript's rapid decay before finally being
   conserved in 1845. It was among the first texts published as a
   photographic facscimile (Zupitza 1882), among the earliest manuscripts
   analysed under ultra-violet light (Smith 1938) and has recently been
   subjected to innovative fibre-optic study (Kiernan 1984).


  <p>  An ultra-violet close up of the space between two letters showing that
   a third letter was erased by the clerk who prepared the manuscript. An
   intuitive navigation tool highlights numerous similar examples of
   damaged or erased letters that have been identified by scholars
   working on the manuscript.

  <p>  At the core of Electronic Beowulf is not one but several Beowulfs. The
   prize in some respects is the 11th century manuscript bound into the
   Cotton Vitellius A XV Codex, and including the other manuscripts that
   were bound with it, such as the Soliloquies of Saint Augustine and a
   fragment of the Anglo-Saxon poem Judith, which deserve more in the way
   of commentary than they receive. The high-resolution images are
   supplemented by close-up back-lit and ultra-violet images that show
   letters now lost to the naked eye, either because of corrections made
   in antiquity, or obscured during conservation. These images are
   presented as 'hot spots' on the text and are navigated effectively and
   cleanly, with a clever tool allowing the user a simple view of the
   manuscript or an interactive view that highlights parts of the text
   that have been lost or found. All this is supported by a hypertext
   dictionary for those of us whose Old English isn't what it ought to
   be, and a series of articles describing the project and the methods
   used to capture the text.

 
   <p> The eleventh century manuscript can be compared to later
   transcriptions, including two transcriptions prepared by GJ Thorkelin
   at the end of the eighteenth century. These show how the medieval
   manuscript has decayed, and allow scholars to develop a critically
   informed reconstruction of the parts of the manuscript now lost.

 <p>   Accompanying this complete set of high-resolution images are equally
   high-resolution images of four early transcriptions of the poem.
   Finally, there is a fifth, modern, transcription and edition that
   highlight the multiple and at times conflicting nature of the text.
   The four early transcriptions reveal the extent of decay in the
   manuscript. Thorkelin's two transcriptions of the 1780s contain some
   900 letters that had decayed or become invisible by the time Conybeare
   saw the manuscript in 1817. Only seven years later, Madden's
   transcription shows that repeated handling of the fragile and rapidly
   disintegrating text had resulted in the loss of some 1,900 letters -
   principally from the edges of the singed manuscript. This set of
   transcriptions demonstrate wonderfully why Thorkelin's edition may be
   more useful for an historical understanding than the medieval
   manuscript, since this has deteriorated very badly since Thorkelin's
   study was published.


  <p>  Electronic Beowulf brings together many different versions of the
   text, including the Cotton Vitellius codex and all the important early
   transcriptions, as well as a modern transcription and edition.
   Navigation allows these different versions to be displayed
   simultaneously in a variety of forms.

  <p>  Thus, Electronic Beowulf is in fact six different Beowulfs. These
   various texts are from many different locations. Thorkelin's
   transcriptions are now in the Royal Library of Denmark, while the
   Madden version is in the Houghton Library at Harvard University. Only
   the Cotton Vitellius A xv manuscript and now the Conybeare
   transcriptions are located in the British Library, the latter only
   being acquired in 1994. Never before have all these texts been
   available in one country, let alone in one place. Now, not only can
   they be studied together, but they have been brought together in an
   environment that makes comparison a simple matter and which
   incorporates the results of sophisticated analytical techniques. The
   effort to achieve this has been phenomenal, but the result is truly
   staggering. Beowulf scholars and students of Old English now have
   unimaginable riches at their fingertips.

  <p>  I only wish I were such a scholar. There is a sense that while all
   these Beowulfs might be considerably more available, they remain as
   inaccessible as ever. For example, it seems truly remarkable that a
   volume so carefully designed, with several versions of the text and a
   dictionary, should be supplied without a simple translation of the
   text. It would not only be helpful for the interested amateur (or the
   list of cross-disciplinary scholars described in the introductory
   blurb accompanying the CD), but it could indeed support an interesting
   exercise in its own right. Comparing the text(s) to translation would
   demonstrate the necessity to return to source texts for an informed
   historical interpretation. Regrettably, Electronic Beowulf is only for
   those students of Anglo-Saxon culture already thoroughly steeped in
   the written language, not for historians or archaeologists who want to
   expand their knowledge. It is certainly not going to enthrall or
   enlighten the public, let alone make them better citizens.


 <p>   As well as a complete set of high resolution images of the medieval
   manuscript, Electronic Beowulf includes a complete modern
   transcription and edition so that students of Old English can improve
   their palaeography skills, by comparing the clean modern edition to
   the script of the manuscript. Search facilities based on the modern
   edition further enhance the high resolutions images.

 <p>   By the same token, the specifications of the computing equipment
   necessary to read the texts seem excessive for a product aimed at such
   a wide audience. The cover notes recommend a Pentium 133 with 32mb RAM
   and Netscape 4.5 and a Java plug-in. The software comes bundled with
   the product, but suffice to say that neither my own (borrowed) laptop
   nor (inherited) home computer could make any sense of it, while even
   my relatively high specification office system struggled at times.
   While there are undoubtedly some very large files involved, it is hard
   to see why such a high threshold is necessary. Savings are certainly
   possible that would have made the whole thing altogether more
   accessible. Navigation depends largely on consistent but ponderous
   menus written in cumbersome Javascript. Simple HTML navigation would
   have sufficed for much of this. A bewildering array of frames occupy
   the browser from time to time, but their multiplication is often
   unnecessary. A few design changes would make for an altogether less
   intimidating encounter.

  <p>  So, it is arguable that Electronic Beowulf doesn't do much to empower
   the public or enhance our access to these highly prized assets: it
   simply disenfranchises us in a new way. There is an important lesson
   here for the political rhetoric of access. Either we need to strain
   every muscle to make sure that we make materials truly accessible (by
   providing tools like translations), or we need to be completely open
   about our design goals and manage expectations accordingly (it's
   really only for an academic audience). The former leaves us with a lot
   more work on our hands, the latter will leave us with much reduced
   funding. In the long run, either horn of the dilemma will be more
   comfortable than a disillusioned and excluded public.

  <p>  The images will undoubtedly facilitate the preservation of the
   manuscript by allowing those readers already familiar with the text to
   address initial queries to the electronic version. Scholars who need
   access to the text will thus be better placed to identify the
   individual folios in question and thus approach the delicate
   manuscript more skilfully. Yet the digital copy presents its own
   preservation problems. A press release associated with the CD makes
   alarming reading, claiming that the CD is a 'complete electronic
   archive'. It certainly is not that.

  <p>  The problems of digital archiving are beginning to be documented in
   slowly unfolding horror, not least by the Archaeology Data Service and
   its colleagues in the Arts and Humanities Data Service. A few of the
   problems are witnessed here, only a few months after the CD was
   released (March 2000). For example, the CD contains hypertext links to
   the British Library web site and the University of Kentucky where much
   of the development took place. Some of these links are already broken
   (assuming that they were correct in the first place) and there is no
   holding page to correct these errors. This demonstrates just one
   reason why CD is not the ideal medium for this sort of product.

  <p>  Other reasons are perhaps more critical in the long term. At present
   there is no statutory deposit library in the UK for electronic
   materials, so there is no organisation mandated to maintain access to
   this CD-Rom in the long term. This is critical given the pace of
   change in digital technologies. Unscientific market research shows
   that computer stores in the York area sell few CD-Roms in comparison
   with Digital Versatile Discs. DVD's are compatible with CD's for the
   time being, but one can't help but think that the CD will soon join
   the Betamax and the Amstrad PCW in the technology which we wished we
   had migrated. If it were almost any organisation other than the
   British Library that was behind Electronic Beowulf, it would be a real
   cause for concern. Given recent noises from the British Library and
   its developing manifesto on digital preservation, I am reassured that
   the data underlying this edition are indeed secure in the long term,
   even if the CD is not.

  <p>  Again, however, there is a lesson here for policy makers and aspiring
   cultural or heritage access programmes. When we spend millions of
   pounds digitising, we really only want to do it once. We certainly
   don't want to have to do it again in five years time. Comprehensive
   guidance exists for digitisation and preservation of data, most of
   which recommends preservation from the outset (e.g. Smith 1998). If we
   really do want to produce more CD-Roms, then we need to have some idea
   in mind regarding how we can make use of them in the long term too:
   which means we certainly need documentation and an idea of appropriate
   file formats. Once again, a little forethought may go a very long way.
   We certainly won't get the money to do this sort of digitisation work
   again, and will face quite an inquest if it goes wrong. The closure of
   the Millennium Dome at the end of 2000 has left the press looking for
   new scapegoats to blame for the misuse of taxpayers' money. Let's make
   sure we're not in their sights. Sustainability is not just a technical
   issue - it's a political one too.

  <p>  It is altogether appropriate that Beowulf be in the vanguard of
   digitisation. But given the extraordinary rhetoric that justifies such
   projects and the unrestrained expectations that surround the digital
   revolution, Electronic Beowulf presages a paradox of inaccessible
   availability.

  <p>  Whose Beowulf is this? What a missed opportunity to make it
   everyone's.
