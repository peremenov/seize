      Documents).  It allows the physician to finalize (i.e. "sign") a

       result reporting (Lab and Rad) systems and to get a listing of
    patients, either through a floor census or through a list associates
      with the physician.  This system is available to both JHH and to

    <h>                          Interface Engine
 <p>    A complex messaging standard, HL7, for the exchange of information
   between systems (patient admitted, lab result, radiology result, diet
    order ...).  An interface engine is a sort of router - applications
   which have something to say send messages to the interface engine, it
    checks to see which other systems have "subscribed" to that specific
     content type of the message, and forwards a copy of the message to
    them.  In the real world, different vendor's systems rarely agree on
    all aspects of the message formatting, so another major function of
      the interface engine is to reformat messages as needed for each
   recipient.  Our HL7 interface engine environment spans JHH and JHBMC,
   includes at least 60 clinical and administrative systems, and delivers
                      about 3,000,000 messages a week.
