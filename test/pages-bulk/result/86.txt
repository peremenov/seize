 <h>The Dan Brown code

 <p>   Approximately three people still haven't read Dan Brown's TheDa Vinci
   Code:Mark Liberman,David Lupher, and reportedly at least one
   otherperson (as yet unidentified).*

 <p>   Regrettably, neither Barbara nor I are ableto claim that the third
   non-reader is one of us. What can I say byway of excuse for this? I
   found the book was on sale really cheap in CostCo when we were about
   to leave on a trip to Europe. I bought it for the long, long flights
   that lay ahead of us, without knowing much about it except that it was
   supposed to be an intellectual mystery with cryptography and symbology
   and stuffand the blurbs said it was great. I didn't open it, I just
   grabbed oneoff a pallet of about 500 copies.Barbara was between
   mysteries at the time, so she grabbed it from meand rapidly read it
   over the next couple of daysbefore we even left for the airport. I
   asked hopefully what it was like. She scowled and said something about
   the Hardy Boys.My heart sank; I understood her to mean it was pathetic
   butpossibly of interest to the 11-year-old market. By the time we
   wereon our plane she had made sure thather flight bag contained a new
   novel byMenking Hannell, and over southern Oregon she told me it was
   great asusual. Unfortunately I had no better idea of what to do with
   my time,so I opened The Da Vinci Code.

  <p>  I am still trying to come up with a fully convincing account of
   justwhat it was about his very first sentence, indeed the very first
   word,that told me instantly that I was in for a very bad time
   stylistically.

 <p>   The Da Vinci Code may well be the only novel ever writtenthat begins
   with the word renowned. Here is the paragraphwith which the book
   opens. The scene (says a dateline under thechapter heading,
   'Prologue') is the Louvre, late at night:

  <p>    Renowned curator Jacques SauniÃ¨re staggered through the vaulted
     archway of the museum's Grand Gallery. He lunged for the nearest
     painting he could see, a Caravaggio. Grabbing the gilded frame, the
     seventy-six-year-oldman heaved the masterpiece toward himself until
     it tore from the wall and SauniÃ¨re collapsed backward in a heap
     beneath the canvas.

 <p>   I think what enabled the first word to tip me off that I was about to
   spenda number of hours in the company of one of the worst prose
   stylists in thehistory of literature was this. Putting curriculum
   vitae details into complex modifiers on proper names or definite
   descriptions is what you do in journalisticstories about deaths; you
   just don't do it in describing an event in a narrative. So this might
   be reasonabletext for the opening of a newspaper report the next day:

  <p>    Renowned curator Jacques SauniÃ¨re died last night in the Louvreat
     the age of 76.

 <p>   But Brown packs such details into the first two words of anaction
   sequence -- details of not only his protagonist's profession but also
   his prestige in the field. It doesn't work here.It has the ring of
   utter ineptitude. The details have no relevance, of course, to what is
   being narrated (SauniÃ¨re isfleeing an attacker and pulls down the
   painting to trigger the alarmsystem and the security gates). We could
   have deduced that he would be fairly well known in the museum trade
   from the fact that he wascurating at the Louvre.

 <p>   The writing goes on in similar vein, committing style and wordchoice
   blunders in almost every paragraph (sometimes every line). Look at the
   phrase "the seventy-six-year-old man".It's a complete let-down: we
   knew he was a man -- the anaphoric pronoun "he" had just been used to
   refer to him. (This is perhaps where "curator" could have been slipped
   in for thefirst time, without "renowned", if the passage were
   rewritten.)Look at "heaved the masterpiece toward himself until it
   tore from the wall and SauniÃ¨re collapsed backward in a heap beneath
   the canvas." We don't need to know it's a masterpiece (it's a
   Caravaggio hanging in the Louvre, that should be enough in the way of
   credentials, for heaven's sake). Surely "toward him" feels better than
   "toward himself" (though I guess both are grammatical here). Surely
   "tore from the wall" shouldbe "tore away from the wall". Surely a
   single man can't fall into aheap (there's only him, that's not a
   heap). And why repeat the name"SauniÃ¨re" here instead of the pronoun
   "he"? Who else is around? (Caravaggio hasn't been mentioned;
   "aCaravaggio" uses the name as an attributive modifier with
   conventionallyelided head noun "painting". That isn't a mention of the
   man.)

 <p>   Well, actually, there is someone else around, but we only learn
   thatthree paragraphs down, after "a thundering iron gate" has fallen
   (by theway, it's the fall that makes a thundering noise: there's no
   such thingas a thundering gate)."The curator" (his profession is now
   named a second time in case you missed it) "...crawled out from under
   the canvas and scanned the cavernous spacefor someplace to hide" (the
   colloquial American "someplace" seems very odd here as compared with
   standard "somewhere"). Then:

  <p>    A voice spoke, chillingly close. "Do not move."

   <p>   On his hands and knees, the curator froze, turning his head slowly.

 <p>     Only fifteen feet away, outside the sealed gate, the mountainous
     silhouette of his attacker stared through the iron bars. He was
     broad and tall, with ghost-pale skin and thinning white hair. His
     irises were pink with dark red pupils.

  <p>  Just count the infelicities here.A voice doesn't speak --a person
   speaks; a voice is what a person speaks with."Chillingly close" would
   be right in your ear, whereas this voice is fifteen feet away behind
   the thundering gate. The curator (do we really need to betold his
   profession a third time?) cannot slowly turn his head if hehas frozen;
   freezing (as a voluntary human action) means temporarilyceasing all
   muscular movements. And crucially, a silhouettedoes not stare! A
   silhouette is a shadow. If SauniÃ¨re can see the man'spale skin,
   thinning hair, iris color, and red pupils (all at fifteen feet),the
   man cannot possibly be in silhouette.

 <p>   Brown's writing is not just bad; it is staggeringly,
   clumsily,thoughtlessly, almost ingeniously bad. In some passages
   scarcely a word or phrase seems to have been carefully selected or
   compared withalternatives. I slogged through 454 pages of this
   syntactic swill, andit never gets much better. Why did I keep reading?
   Because London Heathrow is a long way from San Francisco
   International, and airline magazines are thin, and two-month-old
   Hollywood drivel on a smallscreen hanging two seats in front of my row
   did not appeal, that's why.And why did I keep the book instead of
   dropping it into a Heathrowtrash bin? Because it seemed to me to be
   such a fund of lessonsin how not to write.

 <p>   I don't think I'd want to say these things about a first-time
   novelist, it would seem a cruel blow to a budding career. But Dan
   Brown is all over the best-seller lists now. In paperback and
   hardback, and in manylanguages, he is a phenomenon. He is up there
   with the Stephen Kingsand the John Grishams and nothing I say can
   conceivably harm him. He isa huge, blockbuster, worldwide success who
   can go anywhere he wants andneed never work again. And he writes like
   the kind of freshman student who makes you want to give up the whole
   idea of teaching. Never mind the ridiculous plot and the stupid
   anagrams and puzzle clues as the book proceeds, this is a terrible,
   terrible example of the thriller-writer's craft.

  <p>  Which brings us to the question of the blurbs. "Dan Brown has to be
   one of the best, smartest, and most accomplished writers in
   thecountry," said Nelson DeMille, a bestselling author who has
   himselfhit the #1 spot in the New York Times list.
   Unbelievablemendacity.And there are four other similar pieces of
   praise on the back cover.Together those blurbs convinced me to put
   this piece of garbageon the CostCo cartalong with the the 72-pack of
   toiletrolls. Thriller writers must have a code of honor that
   requiresthat they all praise each other's new novels, a kind of
   omertathat enjoins them to silence about the fact that some fellow
   memberof the guild has given evidence oftotal stylistic cluelessness.
   A fraternal code of silence. We couldcall it... the Da Vinci code; or
   the Dan Brown code.

 <p>   *The third non-reader was unknown when this post wasfirst drafted, but
   it has since been edited, and as of today (May 2, 2004)I can confirm
   that Bill Poser and Danny Yee are both claiming not to haveread The Da
   Vinci Code. Fair enough. So at least four peoplehave not read it. I
   just wish one of them was me.
