<h>Animation - Deo Perez, Lead Animator on Jade Empire

<h>Explain the animation process. When does it begin and what is your role?

<p> Deo: I am the lead animator for Jade Empire
   and am in charge of the all the in-game animations - movements,
   exploration, dialogue, creature and of course, combat. Basically, I am
   the first animator on board the game and I'm the last animator to come
   off the game.

 <p>  I was there in the very beginning of the project, making decisions on
   the animation pipeline, what animations are needed in the game, how
   and when they should be played. Since we have a completely different
   combat system from our past games, I also helped develop this
   real-time combat system. With the help of the other members of the
   core group, I plotted out the number of attacks per style, all the
   different reactions, and the cool combat movements shared by the
   different characters in the game. I also helped define what the dozens
   of styles would be after consulting members of the Jade team, looking
   through different references collected from the internet, books,
   movies and instructional videos.

<p>   Once we knew what we wanted for combat, the next step was to decide
   whether to continue the old tradition of hand animating every move in
   the game like our past games or try something called "motion capture."
   After the long debate between the 2 processes, we decided on using
   motion capture since we wanted the moves in the game especially in
   each martial art styles to look authentic. Besides, it would help us
   go through 700+ actions quicker. Did I say 700+ actions? With 30
   fighting styles with around 20 - 40 moves each, add in the different
   damage reactions, blocks, die cycles, movements and all the
   exploration animations, it came out to more than 700+ actions. Not
   every animation in Jade is motion captured. Creatures, animals and
   monsters were still hand animated.

<p>  Luckily I was not the only animator in the
   project. As other projects were winding down and Jade's production
   ramping up, I had the pleasure of leading most of the skilled and
   talented animators at BioWare at least at one point in the project. My
   job was to assign them different tasks and made sure that the quality
   of animations they produced exceeded expectations.

<p>   As we are coming to the end of the production cycle, some of the
   animators moved to the cinematic department while others moved to new
   projects. The remaining animators, including myself, are ironing out
   animation bugs, fixing glitches, and polishing actions. We are also
   assisting with balancing the styles, and like everyone on the project,
   making sure that Jade Empire is engaging, fun, and one of the best
   games ever developed by BioWare!

<h>What challenges does the theme of Jade Empire -- one focused on martial arts
and Chinese mythology -- bring to animation?

<p>   Deo: Since the game was inspired by Ancient mythical China, it was a
   challenge to gather specific reference during that time. Not only it
   was hard to recreate that time period but we had to create the time
   period if their myths and legends actually came true.

<p>   The bulk of the challenge was developing a completely new combat
   system, different from the Baldur's Gate series, Neverwinter Nights,
   and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. We wanted to immerse the
   player in the combat scenarios, be in control of the character in the
   midst of battle, and not just be a spectator. We needed a real time
   combat system. Not only that, we wanted to give the player the ability
   to learn different martial arts styles as he or she explores the world
   of Jade Empire. So aside from coming up with a new combat system, we
   had to come up with more than 30 unique fighting styles-including
   weapons and magic with the martial arts.

<h>I imagine you're not creating all of these complex martial arts animations
off the top of your head. What are you using for point of reference?

<p>   Deo: Hmmm... it seems you underestimate me. Just kidding! First of
   all, I use my memories as one point of reference. I grew up in the
   Philippines, studying in a Filipino-Chinese school from kindergarten
   to high school (unfortunately, until now, I cannot speak Mandarin). My
   friends then were Chinese whose parents came from either China or
   Taiwan. One of my closest friends came straight from Taiwan. While all
   of us were struggling learning Mandarin, he was struggling learning
   English and Tagalog. I tried to recall some if not all their
   mannerisms, even the way my Chinese teachers taught, how they acted in
   a given situation and used that as reference in the game. Working on
   Jade Empire makes me regret doodling during my Chinese classes instead
   of paying attention to some of the lessons.

<p>   Second, my wife is Thai but of Chinese ethnicity. Both her parents
   came from China and immigrated to Thailand. I've been to Thailand with
   her a few times and observed some of her Thai/Chinese/Buddhist
   traditions. I know Thailand is no China, but like China, its culture
   was untouched by western civilization. Thanks to my wife and her
   family's love for Chinese soap operas, I was able to watch a few of
   them, especially those set in ancient China.

<p>   I have studied Taekwondo, Aikido, Capoiera, and a little kung fu self
   defense but not enough to be a master of any. These helped create the
   prototype style dubbed the "Deo" style. Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Jet
   Li, Chow Yun Fat, Donnie Yen, Michelle Yeoh, Zhang Ziyi and other
   martial arts experts were the greatest points of reference for most of
   the martial arts styles. Thanks to Jade Empire, BioWare has a DVD and
   VHS collection of the best martial arts movies and instructional
   tapes. I also have to give credit to the mocap actors and stunt
   persons who were gracious enough to lend their talents and expertise
   to us. They helped us come up with the coolest moves for each style
   and the best knock downs and die animations ever made for an action
   RPG.

<h>Is Jade Empire going to have the best animation we've ever seen in an RPG?

<p>   Deo: The proud person in me says it is the best animation among the
   recently released RPGs. The humble side of me says it's up there with
   the best RPGs to date.
