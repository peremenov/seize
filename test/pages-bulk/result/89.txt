<h>Writing a Mechanism Description
<h>Analyzing the Function, Appearance and Operation of an Object



 <p>    This document describes how to write a mechanism description (also
     called an object description).  A mechanism description is a short
     report designed to convey to the reader a technical understanding
     of the function, appearance, and operation of a particular object.
     In one or two sentences, give the reader a quick overview of these
     three elements, before you lauch into the details.


 <p>   A mechanism description analyzes (that is, subdivides into components
   for futher scrutiny) an object in space. Among the rhetorical patterns
   you might employ are definition, partition, classification, and
   comparison/contrast. When nothing else seems appropriate, you can
   always fall back on the more-important-to-less-important strategy.
    
<l>    * Don't sell the object.
       A technical writer is not required to persuade the reader that the
       object is wonderful, or valuable, or scary. But do mention the
       details. While you shouldn't say an object is "adorably cute," you
       could mention that it "resembles a cartoon cow wearing a pink
       ruffled skirt," and let your readers make the value judgment for
       themselves.
 <l>    * Just describe it.
       Provide whatever level of detail your reader requires. Know your
       audience.  A child safety organization may require an extremely
       detailed description of a simple toy (along with a separate
       process description for the manufacture of each component), while
       a military recruitment office might require only a few paragraphs
       about a complex nuclear submarine.

 <h>Introduction

  <p>  Your introduction should first state the purpose and scope of your
   document.  If your document is longer than a few paragraphs, the first
   paragraph should be a stand-alone summary, which briefly defines the
   object and explains its function, appearance, and operation.

  <p>  No Throughout the ages, mankind has found many uses for salt.  Ancient
   tribes used it preserve meat; around the world it adds flavor to food;
   the Bible uses it as a symbol of zest for life.  Salt became such an
   important part of people's diet that a way was needed to allow early
   nomads to carry salt with them on their perilous travels; such a
   device ideally also helped ancient gormandizers to distribute portions
   of the precious flavor enhancer onto their foods.  Thus was born the
   salt shaker.
  
  <p> Some beginning technical writers, who remember using grandiose words
   to please their high school English teachers, mistakenly believe that
   an introduction should provide a sort of cosmic overview. But a
   technical writer does not need to amuse or impress a reader --
   somebody who wants to know exactly how much this salt shaker weighs
   does not need an ancient history lesson. Just provide the necessary
   information as efficiently as possible.

  <p>  This document provides the manufacturing specifications for
   the entire line of Happy Homemaker "Praying Cow" salt shakers (Divine
   Bovine Industries model #00045).  A hand-painted ceramic collector's
   item, the "Praying Cow" salt shaker represents a plump, cartoon-like
   cow, her head bowed as if in prayer.  A blue flower-print skirt is
   painted onto the body of the animal.  The salt is dispensed through
   the cow's matching bonnet, via a circular array of six small holes.
   The bonnet twists off to allow the consumer to fill the dispenser
   cavity.

 <l>    * Note that this writer correctly begins by introducing the reader
       to the document.  We can assume that the rest of the document
       provides the measurements and other technical details, as promised
       by the opening sentence.
 <l>    * The summary paragraph assumes that the reader already knows the
       definition and function of a salt shaker; this is permissible.
 <l>    * In this case, it would not be wise to omit a description of the
       appearance, and almost unforgivable not to include a picture.
 <l>    * Fortunately for civilization as we know it, this product is
       completely imaginary.

 <h>Function

 <p>   Answer the question, "What does it do?" If the object participates in
   a process, then you may need to write a brief process description as
   well. Keep this section brief -- chance are, if your reader is
   interested in a full mechanism description, he or she already has some
   idea what the object is for. Of course, if the object will be so
   unfamiliar to your reader that the rest of the document won't make
   sense, then provide whatever background information your reader is
   likely to need. (Sometimes the only way to do this is to show a
   prototype of your mechanism description to a test user... )

 <h>Appearance

  <p>  Answer the question, "What does it look like?"  You may have to use
   classification to break the object up into its various components, and
   describe each in sequence.

 <p>The original Star Trek Enterprise, TV's most famous fictional
   starship, has a saucer shaped primary hull, a cigar-shaped secondary
   hull, and two cylindrical warp pods.  A horizontal strut suspends the
   secondary hull behind and below the saucer.  At the flat, front of the
   suspended section is the deflector dish, and at the tapered back are
   clamshell doors that open to reveal a shuttle bay.  Each of the two
   cylindrical power units is supported by a long pylon connected near
   the rear of the secondary hull.  The pylons raise the power units
   above the plane of the horizontal dish, and extend them outwards
   roughly to the same width of the saucer.  The pods themselves have red
   semicircular half-spheres on the front, and tapered cylindrical
   fixtures on the rear.
   
  <p>  The content of the above section is fine, but it's a little hard to
   read.   If you were to go in to any more detail, you should break it
   up into smaller paragraphs... If you start to break your object up
   into multiple nested layers of components, you should consider a
   bulleted list, formatted so that your reader can more easily identify
   the level of detail you are describing in any given section. (See
   below.)


  <p>  The primary hull contains the following visible features:
   <l>  * The bridge (a circular, domed structure at the center of the upper
       surface of the saucer).

   <l>  * The first pilot episode, "The Cage" featured a special effects
       shot of the camera zooming in on the model to reveal the
       characters arranged on the bridge; the same shot also appeared as
       a kind of flashback in the later episode, "The Menagerie, Part I."
<l>     * The set for the bridge on Star Trek: The Next Generation featured
       a ceiling window that revealed a starry backdrop, but no such
       window ever appeared in the original series.

 <l>    Lighting effects (including blinking running lights, as well as
   smaller lights representing windows)

<l>     Vessel identification (black painted capital letters on the upper
   and lower surfaces of the saucer, reading "U.S.S. Enterprise" and
   "NCC-1701")

<l>     Phasers and photon torpedoes (usually depicted as emanating from a
   spot near the center of the underside of the saucer)

 <h>Operation

  <p>  Answer the question, "How does it work?"

  <p>  You could also productively think of this section as the conclusion to
   your paper.  Rarely will you gain anything by writing a lame, strained
   conclusion like, "Therefore, this paper has shown that the PickMaster
   2000 Electric Toothpick Dispenser can be an exciting part of the
   environment around the cash register in any restaurant."

  <p>  Even if an object does not have an exciting or visible method of
   operating (such as a decorative item or a simple brick), you should
   still explain how its design helps it to fulfill its function.
