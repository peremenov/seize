 <h>LAPD Wife


 <h>Merry Christmas!

 <p>   Leosnowman_2 The first year that Officer Jake was on the LAPD he was
   the new guy in town - literally. He'd moved here from out of state and
   only had a distant cousin who lived way up in Ventura. When Christmas
   rolled around, he was still a fresh boot - only a few months out of
   the Academy and working weekends, holidays, etc. And so he spent his
   first Christmas in L.A. on the job - out all day patrolling in a black
   and white. He had a few cookies at the station, I'm sure. But after
   work he went home to his bachelor apartment and had a tradition
   holiday meal of .... Pollo Loco.
  
   <p>When he first told me this story I thought I was going to cry. I just
   wanted to hug him like he was a child and tell him he'd never be alone
   or eating bad chicken on Christmas again. But this is pretty common
   for a lot of law enforcement officers everywhere. Crime doesn't take
   holidays or weekends off. And neither do police officers.
   
  <p>  So here's to the rookies from out of town working on the holidays - I
   hope you are greeted by well-wishers, lots of treats and invited to
   someone's home for a proper family meal. I instructed Jake to ask
   around the station and see if there are any young men or women who are
   in a similar situation as the young Officer Jake found himself that
   Christmas so long ago. He has standing orders from this watch
   commander (me!) to invite them over.

  <p>  And I'm not forgetting the seasoned officers still working the
   holidays. Thanks for hanging in there and doing the good job that you
   do. You are appreciated!

  <p>  And here's to the wives and families, missing their officers but
   waiting faithfully for them to get back home after their shift and
   share in the festivities. In the past we've celebrated on alternate
   days or waited to open presents til Daddy got home. It's important to
   find a rhythm in your family to dealing with the missed holidays and
   weekend time off.

 <p>   And here's to my readers. You've made my Christmas wonderful by being
   so supportive of me here. Thanks!

  <p>  Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays everyone!

 <h>LAPD Wife - The Newsletter

 <p>   Lips Due to high demand, I've decided to create "LAPD Wife - The
   Newsletter" to hold you all over while I take a couple months to
   reorganize (see the post "Not a Goodbye, below). This will probably be
   a once-a-month deal, but hey, you know I'll make it worth your while.
   So email me with your email address and I'll add you to my
   "subscription" list. The price is right... free! And I promise to keep
   your email address confidential and never, ever use it for my own evil
   purposes.

  <p>  I'm going to turn off comments here, because I don't want you to
   mistakenly put your email on this post for all the world to see.
   Again, send me your email address via my email and I'll make sure
   you're on the list. How very "L.A!"

  <p>  (To clarify, this is an e-newsletter only. Don't send me your postal
   address. Email addresses only. thanks!)

 <h>Not a Goodbye

 <p>Over two years ago, in June of 2004, "LAPD Wife" was
   born. I've nurtured this site with news and articles of police family
   life and shared personal stories of the ups, downs and crazy turns in
   my life married to Officer Jake, an LAPD narcotics officer.

  <p>  I've made so many new friends and met many interesting, fascinating
   people online. I feel like my original goal of using this site to
   reach out to other wives and family members of law enforcement has
   been reached and in fact, has grown beyond my wildest expectations.
   I've had nearly 300,000 hits in this short life and maintained a daily
   average of nearly 600.

 <p>   And so it saddens me to do this, but I'm now at a point where I need
   to take a break, step away from the keyboard and rejuvenate. My life,
   always busy, has reached new pinnacles of craziness both
   professionally and personally. Don't worry, all is well with me, I'm
   just exploring new ideas and trying out new avenues for my creative
   self.

  <p>  I've tried to put up this post often during the last couple of weeks,
   but it seems like every day as my finger hovered over the Save button,
   I'd get another e-mail from an leo wife who had "just found my site"
   and "was so excited to find someone writing about our lives who really
   understands" ...and I just couldn't do it. It still kills me to step
   back like this, but I'm burning out and not doing you all much good in
   this stage.

 <p>   I'm keeping the rights to this url, and I'd
   encourage you to check back every month or so to see what I'm up to. I
   also will still have my e-mail address, so feel free to drop me a line
   once in awhile. I have a lot of ideas circling
   in my very crowded head that I'm sure many of you will love and still
   will cater to the leo family life theme I've always followed. Just
   will take a little time, a lot of effort and great amounts of love to
   bring them to life.

  <p>  To all of you who have been my loyal readers, my ardent commentors, my
   site watchdogs and most of all, my friends - thank you. This site has
   been a labor of love for me and I feel well rewarded from the contacts
   I've made and the community I've felt among us all. And the biggest
   thanks of all goes to Office Jake, without which there would be no
   "LAPD Wife."

  <p>  Thanks - and look for me in the New Year - I'll see you soon.

 <h>Happy 231st Birthday Marines!

  <p>  Every year GoDaddy, a service I use for maintaining this site and
   others I administer, puts up a a special salute to the men and women
   of the United States Marine Corps. This year Gunnery Sgt. R. Lee Ermey
   of Full Metal Jacket fame collaborates with them. I know that a lot of
   Marine wives and family members also read my site, so I'm putting up
   the link for them here. Even if you're not a part of the Marine Corps,
   this is a worthy watch.

 <h>Back at the Farm

 <p> Meanwhile, back at the farm, I've been replaced. My parents
   have 2 new horses and they are the apples of their eyes. I have a
   feeling that my old room is probably filled with saddle and tack now.
   And there will be Christmas stockings hung on the fireplace with their
   names - Richard and Rockabye. (Just kidding, Mom!)

 <p>   I apologize for how pixelated these photos are and will try to get
   better ones uploaded soon. And no, they weren't taken with my fancy
   new camera. Click on my photo album, on the left, to see my
   photography work. Richard_2

 <h>Facing the Fire

  <p>   I've been caught up in the drama and tragedy of the Esperanza fire
   these last couple of days. Four firemen dead, another critical with
   burns on near 90 percent of his body. The story, full of heroism and
   horror, has caught the attention of everyone. Stories are continually
   updating, but I was especially drawn in by the photo gallery at the LA
   Daily News. The pictures there of fireman on the front line are so
   intense I could almost imagine the feel of the heat and wind there.

  <p>  I was with a colleague at work when the news of the deaths of the
   firemen broke. She knows I am married to a police officer and asked if
   I took this news a bit more personally. I did, I do, I always will. I
   think that wives of police officers and wives of firemen, while having
   their small differences, will always have much in common.

  <p>  Our husbands face great dangers at work - I just think that the danger
   is spread about differently. While police officers get a general even
   dose of it throughout their jobs, firemen face danger in extreme doses
   in between calm spaces. It all evens out in the end, I'm sure.

  <p>  And so my heart goes out to the wives and family members of these
   firemen who perished - and all firemen who are still working the lines
   out there. It's no fun to sit back here, watch the news coverage, and
   try to see if we can recognize our husbands somewhere in the
   background of the various news footage. And yet we remain proud of
   them and the work they do. And breathe easier every night they return
   home safely.

 <h>LAPD Officer Landon Dorris

  <p>  Badgeband_1 Stereotypes make believe that families of police officers
   worry most about high-drama trouble like mafia hits, vengeful drug
   lords and Fatal Attraction groupies. But in reality, the worries we
   carry for our loved ones are more common and yet often more deadly. My
   husband has often said that domestic violence situations hold more
   deadly potential for law enforcement that other seemingly dramatic
   situations.

  <p>  Traffic accidents are another situation that routinely bring harm and,
   sadly, death to officers. As in the case of Officer Landon Dorris, who
   was killed during a routine traffic collision investigation yesterday
   in the NorthEast division. Flags are flying at half-mast today at
   stations around L.A. May we all take a moment today to think of him
   and his family left behind and appreciate his brothers and sisters in
   blue who carry on.

 <h>The Hungry Detective

  <p>  I was watching the Food Network this weekend and saw a new series was
   debuting called "The Hungry Detective." Hmm, sounded interesting, so I
   hit the menu guide to see a description. It read something like this:
   "Los Angeles detective travels the nation and brings us tips for the
   best food etc..."

  <p>  Ok, this made me pop up and go to the computer, yelling for Jake as I
   booted it up: "Oh, honey, you've just gotta see this!" On the Food
   Network site, I found a much better description and Jake was looking
   over my shoulder to see if it was someone he knows (and could totally
   give `em hell about at work). No such luck.

  <p>  Turns out, if I'm reading their intro right, Detective Chris Cognac
   works for a South Bay police department. Most of the info about his
   police department is vague, but I'm guessing it's Hawthorne from one
   of the photo links on a separate page I found when I googled him.
   Funny that the Food Network is pushing the whole "Los Angeles
   detective" bit. It makes it seem like they want people to think LAPD.
   I did, anyway, at first. Guess it sounds sexier, as well as more
   recognizable, than South Bay.

  <p>  Here's some of the web site content - they use the police angle a
   little cheesily, but hey, it's a theme and if anyone can understand a
   theme - it's me! :

  <p>  "His name is Chris Cognac, and he works two beats: he's a true-blue
   police detective in Los Angeles AND he's the food critic for his local
   paper, guiding readers to hidden gem restaurants in his hometown. Now,
   Chris is leaving his jurisdiction for cities across America, on a
   mission to uncover the best off-the-beaten-path restaurants in each
   place that only the locals know. Using all of his detective skills and
   trusty informants along the way, Chris will teach viewers how to
   uncover clues to hidden gem eateries in any town."

  <p>  I haven't watched the show yet, though I did watch a few of the online
   clips previewing segments and interviewing Detective Cognac. Looks
   like it could be fun. Let me know if anyone else out there has caught
   it. And as they say... who knows local food better than the local
   police? I totally agree!
