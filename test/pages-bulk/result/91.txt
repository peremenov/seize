 <h>Abstract

 <p>   Metadata interoperability is a fundamental requirement for access to
   information within networked knowledge organization systems. The
   Harmony international digital library project  has developed a
   common underlying data model (the ABC model) to enable the scalable
   mapping of metadata descriptions across domains and media types. The
   ABC model  provides a set of basic building blocks for metadata
   modeling and recognizes the importance of 'events' to describe
   unambiguously metadata for objects with a complex history. To test and
   evaluate the interoperability capabilities of this model, we applied
   it to some real multimedia examples and analysed the results of
   mapping from the ABC model to various different metadata domains using
   XSLT . This work revealed serious limitations in the ability of
   XSLT to support flexible dynamic semantic mapping. To overcome this,
   we developed MetaNet , a metadata term thesaurus which provides the
   additional semantic knowledge that is non-existent within declarative
   XML-encoded metadata descriptions. This paper describes MetaNet, its
   RDF Schema  representation and a hybrid mapping approach which
   combines the structural and syntactic mapping capabilities of XSLT
   with the semantic knowledge of MetaNet, to enable flexible and dynamic
   mapping among metadata standards.


 <h>1 Introduction

  <p>  Networked knowledge organisation systems typically contain objects of
   mixed media types which are described using a multitude of diverse
   metadata schemas. Hence machine understanding of metadata descriptions
   which conform to schemas from different domains is a fundamental
   requirement for access to information within networked knowledge
   organization systems. In particular, there are three main scenarios in
   which interoperability among metadata descriptions is required:
     
  <l>    * To enable a single search interface across heterogeneous metadata
       descriptions;
<l>      * To enable the integration or merging of descriptions which are
       based on complementary but possibly overlapping metadata schemas
       or standards;
 <l>     * To enable different views of the one underlying and complete
       metadata description, depending on the user's particular interest,
       perpective or requirements.

 <p>   Metadata descriptions from different domains are not semantically
   distinct but overlap and relate to each other in complex ways.
   Achieving interoperability between such metadata descriptions via
   manually-generated one-to-one crosswalks [6] is useful, but this
   approach does not scale to the many metadata vocabularies that will
   develop. A more scalable and cost-effective approach is to exploit the
   fact that many entities and relationships - for example, people,
   places, creations, organisations, events, etc. - occur across all of
   the domains. The Harmony project  has been investigating this more
   general approach towards metadata interoperability and in the process
   has developed the ABC model and vocabulary .

<p>   The hypothesis is that such an approach will lead to more efficient,
   scalable machine-translations between heterogeneous metadata
   descriptions. To test this hypothesis and to evaluate the
   interoperability capabilities of the ABC model, we applied it to some
   real multimedia examples and analysed the results of mapping from the
   ABC model to various different metadata domains using XSLT . This
   work revealed serious limitations in XSLT's ability to support
   flexible dynamic semantic mapping. To overcome this, we developed
   MetaNet , a metadata term thesaurus which provides the additional
   semantic knowledge that is non-existent within declarative XML-encoded
   metadata descriptions.

 <p>  This paper describes the optimum metadata mapping approach determined
   from applying the ABC model to a small test set of multimedia
   examples. This approach combines:
   
 <l>     * the ABC event-aware metadata model, developed within the Harmony
       project, as the underlying model for scalable generic mappings
       between domain-specific vocabularies, with;
 <l>     * XSLT for parsing XML descriptions and performing structural and
       syntactic mapping, and;
 <l>     * MetaNet, a metadata term thesaurus, to provide the semantic
       knowledge required to enable semantic mapping between metadata
       terms from different domains or standards.

 <h>2 Definitions of Terms

 <p>   This section defines the key terms used throughout the remainder of
   the paper:
   
  <l>    * Metadata - data about data - or more commonly "descriptive
       information about Web resources". The use of standardized
       descriptive metadata can substantially improve the discovery and
       retrieval of relevant networked resources. Different communities
       or domains have developed their own standardized metadata
       vocaularies to meet their specific needs.
  <l>    * Vocabularies - shared terminologies with commonly agreed-upon
       semantics for a domain. Common vocabularies enable search engines,
       agents, authors and users to communicate within a domain.
  <l>    * Schemas - provide a standard way of defining standard
       domain-specific vocabularies by defining a common set of elements,
       their semantics and the relationships between the elements.
  <l>    * Ontology - a formal description of the concepts, roles and
       relationships that exist for an agent or community of agents.
       Ontologies provide a shared and common understanding of a domain
       that can be communicated across people and applications, and play
       a major role in supporting information exchange and discovery.
   <l>   * Thesaurus - the vocabulary of a controlled indexing language,
       formally organized so that the a priori relationships between
       concepts (for example "broader" and "narrower") are made explicit.
       
  <l>    * Metadata Thesaurus - a thesaurus which defines the
       relationships between metadata terms from different domain
       vocabularies.

 <h>3 Related Work

  <p>  Thesauri have been used to improve the precision and recall of
   information retrieval systems for over 30 years. The introduction of
   automated information retrieval has caused a dramatic increase in the
   demand for vocabulary control, particularly in the last decade.
   Examples of well known thesauri used to provide authority control over
   the terms used for indexing documents in the bibliographic, medical
   and cultural domains respectively are: the Library of Congress Subject
   Headings (LCSH) , the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)  and the
   Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT).  In addition, thesauri have
   been used within information retrieval systems to improve retrieval
   effectiveness by providing semantic roadmaps. 

  <p> Since the emergence of the Internet, a great deal of effort has been
   invested in the development of metadata vocabularies to enable the
   exchange and discovery of information across different applications
   and domains. Metadata vocabularies such as Dublin Core , USMARC
   , INDECS , MPEG-7, FGDC , IEEE LOM  and CIDOC CRM
   provide standardized sets of descriptive elements to enable the
   exchange of resources for specific applications or domains. Although
   these standards enable interoperability within domains, they introduce
   the problem of incompatibility between disparate and heterogeneous
   metadata descriptions or schemas across domains.

<p>   A literature survey reveals many different proposals for improving
   interoperability between domain-specific vocabularies, thesauri and
   ontologies in the context of information retrieval and exchange. These
   range from database schema integration , to the use of ontologies
   in organizing and integrating networked information systems e.g.
   OBSERVER , InfoSleuth , OntoSeek  to the merging of
   monolingual  and multilingual thesauri.  Two of the major
   research issues have been categorizing the complex kinds of
   interthesaurus semantic relationships which exist  and automating
   the detection of these relationships during the merging process. 

<p>   More recently the approach to merging thesauri has been to represent
   them formally using RDF Schemas  and to use inference engines to
   automate the merging - such as has been proposed in the Ontology
   Inference Layer (OIL). 

 <p>  In this paper we are not so much concerned with the specific process
   by which MetaNet is generated or with expressing the complete set of
   possible term relations (as described in ISO 2788) in MetaNet. Our
   primary objective is to generate a thesaurus which specifies (an
   albeit simplified) set of semantic relationships between metadata
   terms from a number of different domain schemas relative to the ABC
   underlying vocabulary (the preferred terms) and hence also to each
   other. Our goal is then to demonstrate how this semantic knowledge can
   be represented in a machine-readable format (RDF Schema) and extracted
   and combined with the syntactic and structural mapping capabilities of
   XSLT to enable the implementation of flexible dynamic mappings between
   metadata descriptions from different domains.

<h>4 Overview of the ABC Underlying Metadata Model

 <p>  The Harmony Project  is investigating a generic approach to
   metadata interoperability through the development of an event-aware
   metadata model. The ABC modeldefines a set of fundamental classes
   which provide the building blocks for expression (through
   sub-classing) of application-specific or domain-specific metadata
   vocabularies. The base classes, shown below, were determined by
   analysing commonalities between different communities' metadata models
   (including: Dublin Core; INDECS ; MPEG-7 ; CIDOC CRM
   ; IFLA .)
    
 <l>   * Resources
  <l>   * Events
  <l>    * Inputs and Outputs
  <l>    * Acts

  <l>    * Agents
  <l>    * Roles

   <l>   Context
   <l>   * Time
  <l>    * Place

 <p>     Event Relations ABC adopts an event-aware view for modeling the
   relationship between the various manifestations of a creation. This
   event-aware view provides semantically clear attachment points for the
   association of properties among the various manifestations, events and
   contributors (agents) involved in a resource's lifecycle. In addition,
   ABC provides a multiple views philosophy for metadata modeling and
   recipes for inter-conversion between those views. If life-cycle
   information is required, the event model can be used. When single
   resource metadata is needed, a resource-centric state model is used.
   Figure 1 shows the UML representation for the ABC metadata model.

                 

 <h> 5 A Simple Example

   <p>  To test the ABC model and evaluate XSLT for metadata mapping, we
   considered the following simple illustrative example:

  <p>     "A resource which is a 130 min audio (MP3) recording of a 'Live at
     Lincoln Center' performance. The Orchestra is the New York
     Philharmonic. The performance was on April 7, 1998 at 8 pm Eastern
     Time. The musical score performed is 'Concerto for Violin'.
     Copyright for the entire performance is held by Lincoln Center for
     the Performing Arts."

  <p>   First we describe this resource using the ABC model. We then attempt
   to map from the ABC description to Dublin Core, MPEG-7 and ID3 [32]
   descriptions respectively, using XSLT. Figure 2 illustrates the two
   steps involved in mapping from the ABC metadata model to
   resource-centric models such as Dublin Core, MPEG-7 and ID3:

  <l>    1. The structural mapping step involves transferring event properties
       to the output resource and creating a relationship between the
         output and input resources associated with the event.
  <l>    2. The semantic mapping step involves mapping the properties attached
       to the output resource to semantically-equivalent properties in
       the output domain.

 
  <h>  5.1 Structural Mapping Rules

 <p>    For events which generate an output resource from an input resource,
   the transformation from an event-aware metadata model to a simple
   resource-centric metadata model consists of the following steps:
   
 <l>     1. The Date, Time and Place properties within the Event's Context
       node can be qualified using the Event Type and transferred to the
       target output resource, e.g. Date.Performance, Time.Performance,
       Place.Performance;
   <l>   2. The Role property of each Act associated with an event becomes a
       qualifier on the Agent property which is attached to the target
       output resource and its value is the Act's Agent Name, e.g. the
       Agent.Orchestra property has value "New York Philharmonic";
 <l>     3. A Relation property arc is generated from the event type (e.g.
       Performance -> Relation.isPerformanceOf) and is attached to the
       target output resource. The value of this property is the patient
       input resource of the event (e.g. "comp523").
  <l>    4. All other existing properties of the input and output resource
       remain the same.

  <p>   Other inheritance and metadata derivation rules may be possible but
   these require further investigation.
   For example, a Description property for the output resource can be
   generated from the Event Type and the input resource's Title e.g.
   "Performance of 'Concerto for Violin'". Or in many cases, the Title
   property can be inherited by the output resource directly from the
   Title property of either the input resource or the event.

 <h> 6 An Evaluation of XSLT for Metadata Mappings

  <p>   The Extensible Style Language (XSL)  consists of a transformation
   language (XSLT) and a formatting language. The transformation language
   XSLT (which acts independently of the formatting language) provides
   elements that define rules for how one XML document is transformed
   into another XML document. The transformed XML document may use the
   markup and DTD of the original document or it may use a completely
   different set of tags. The ability of XSLT to transform data from one
   XML representation to another makes it appear to be ideal for metadata
   interchange applications.

  <p>   An XSL document contains a list of templates and rules. A template
   rule has a pattern specifying the trees it applies to and a template
   to be output when the pattern is matched. When an XSL processor
   formats an XML document using an XSL style sheet, it scans the XML
   document tree looking through each sub-tree in turn. As each tree in
   the XML document is read, the processor compares it with the pattern
   of each template rule in the style sheet. When the processor finds a
   tree that matches a template rule's pattern, it outputs the rule's
   template. This template generally includes some markup, some new data
   and some data copied out of the tree from the original XML document.

  <p>   Using XSLT and the Xalan  XSLT processor we developed XSL programs
   for transforming the ABC description above to DC, ID3 and MPEG-7
   descriptions, respectively. Appendix B shows the resulting XSL files.

  <p>   The mapping implementations in Appendix B revealed that although XSLT
   works well for the structural mapping from an event model to a
   resource-centric model based on the set of rules described in Section
   3.1, it is inadequate for implementing flexible dynamic semantic
   mappings between metadata vocabularies. This is due to:
   
  <l>     * XSLT's limited capabilities for handling variable input
       descriptions based on schemas which are not tightly constrained;
   <l>    * The non-existence of machine-understandable semantic information
       in declarative XML-encoded metadata descriptions;
  <l>     * Processor-dependent handling of input parameters and procedural
       code extensions;
  <l>     * Limited string manipulation and comparison functions, e.g. it is
       not possible to perform case-insensitive string comparisons within
       XSLT.

  <p>   The mappings revealed that if the input XML descriptions are
   relatively fixed and tightly constrained, then the semantic mappings
   can be hardwired and XSLT is adequate. But if the input descriptions
   are at all variable or unpredictable (e.g. undefined domain specific
   sub-classing and attributes) then XSL simply cannot cope. Cawsey
   investigated the use of XSLT for customizing RDF descriptions,
   reaching similar conclusions. 

  <p>   Below are listed a number of possible approaches to handling the
   semantic mapping problem. The approach chosen is a balance between
   simplicity on the one hand, and flexibility or scalability on the
   other. The wider the targeted scope of interoperability, the more
   difficult it is to achieve accurate, precise mappings. Below is a list
   of mapping approaches in increasing order of both scope and
   difficulty:
   
  <l>    1. Hardwire crosswalks between metadata terms from specific metadata
       domains (easy, but only works for fixed input);
   <l>    2. Extract mappings from a pre-defined multiple-domain mapping
       matrix;
   <l>    3. Determine the semantic mappings from a metadata term ontology;
   <l>    4. Determine the semantic mappings from a generic ontology such as
       WordNet;
    <l>   5. Determine the semantic mappings from a dynamically generated
       ontology created by using inferencing to merge multiple
       domain-specific ontologies.

<p>   By reducing the scope of the problem to interoperability between
   existing metadata standards, then the fully generic approaches (e.g.,
   4 and 5 above) become unnecessarily complex. Hence in the remainder of
   this paper we investigate the less complex but still moderately
   flexible approaches (2 and 3) based on a mapping matrix and a metadata
   term ontology, respectively.

<h>7 Semantic Mapping via a Mapping Matrix

  <p> The second approach in the list above involves linking a mapping
   matrix to the XSLT processor. The mapping matrix explicitly defines
   the semantic mappings between a fixed set of metadata vocabularies
   from a number of different domains. Figure 3 illustrates such a
   mapping matrix. If XPath [35] is used to specify the elements, then to
   some extent both the structural and semantic mappings can be defined.

 <p>     This approach has certain debilitating limitations, however. A matrix
   is only capable of specifying mappings which involve fairly simple
   one-to-one mappings, and a two-dimensional matrix will only work if
   the mappings are symmetrical in both directions across all the
   domains. If the mappings are asymetrical then the matrix becomes
   highly complex and multi-dimensional. However, the primary limitation
   of this approach is that it simply does not scale - as the number of
   domains grows and the mappings become asymmetrical, then the matrix
   becomes excessively complex and unwieldy.

<h>8 Development of MetaNet, a Metadata Term Thesaurus

 <p>  Rather than limiting the semantic mapping to a fixed number of
   domains/vocabularies (i.e. the number of columns in the mapping
   matrix), a more generic approach is to extract the mapping dynamically
   from a thesaurus of metadata terms, generated by formally defining
   relationships between metadata terms from a number of different
   domains' standardized vocabularies.

 <h> 8.1 Intrathesaurus and Interthesaurus Relations

 <p>  The ISO2788 standard for the identification and documentation of
   monolingual thesauri  identifies the following types of
   intrathesaurus relations:
   
 <l>    * hierarchical
 <l>    * associative
 <l>    * equivalence

<p>   The hierarchical relation occurs between concepts having
   "broader/narrower" meanings. This can be further specialized into the
   generic (BTG/NTG), whole-part (BTP/NTP) and instance (BT/NT)
   relations. For the sake of simplicity, we have chosen only to model
   the BTG/NTG relation (a common practice among thesauri developers) and
   the equivalence relation, and not to include associative relations
   within MetaNet.

<p>   The ISO5964 standard for the documentation and establishment of
   multilingual thesauri identifies the following types of
      interthesaurus relations:
      
  <l>    * exact equivalence
  <l>    * partial equivalence
  <l>    * single to multiple equivalence
  <l>    * inexact equivalence.

 <p>  These relations indicate that the semantic relations between terms
   from different metadata vocabularies are likely to be much more
   complex than one-to-one exact equivalence and that even "exact
   equivalence" will be an approximation. However, because the scope of
   our problem is limited to relations between terms in a number of
   standardized English metadata vocabularies, then we can expect the
   frequency of more complex mappings to be less than for general natural
   language thesauri. For the first draft of MetaNet, we decided only to
   consider exact and partial equivalence relations and to combine them
   in the ET relation which defines equivalent/overlapping terms. If two
   different domains use two different metadata terms which are ETs in
   our thesaurus then we make the assumption that the domains are
   referring to semantically equivalent concepts.

<p>   Consequently the metadata term thesaurus which we have developed,
   MetaNet , contains only preferred terms (the ABC core vocabulary),
   equivalent/overlapping terms (ET), narrower terms (NT) and broader
   terms (BT), and attempts to encompass terms from the most significant
   and widely-used metadata vocabularies (Dublin Core, IFLA, IEEE LOM,
   INDECS).

 <h> 8.2 Description of MetaNet

 <p>  The objective of the MetaNet thesaurus is to provide the semantic
   knowledge required to enable machine understanding of equivalence and
   hierarchical (subtyping) relationships between metadata terms from
   different domains. The scope of this thesaurus is limited to the most
   significant metadata models/vocabularies used for describing
   attributes and events associated with resources and their life cycles.
   This encompasses metadata vocabularies from the bibliographic, museum,
   archival, record keeping and rights management communities. It has
   been developed by performing WordNet  searches using the core
   terms from the ABC vocabulary, and extracting those synonyms and
   hyponyms which could conceivably be used in a metadata scheme to
   represent the original core term. In addition, the results have been
   compared with the vocabularies of the DC, INDECS, IFLA, IMS and CIDOC
   CRM vocabularies to check that the majority of the terms used in these
   metadata dictionaries have been incorporated into the thesaurus.

<p>   A machine-readable RDF Schema representation of this thesaurus has
   been developed. The RDF and RDF Schema elements, Class,
   subClassOf, property, subPropertyOf are used to define the
   hierarchical/subtyping and entity/attribute relationships between
   metadata elements. The RDFS label element is used to specify
   semantically equivalent terms which may be used. The ABC core
   vocabulary is used as the top-level set of preferred terms. Although
   this thesaurus has been generated manually, it could conceivably be
   generated automatically by using inferencing mechanisms to merge RDF
   Schemas from different domains, as has been proposed in the Ontology
   Inference Layer (OIL). [30]

 <p>  For example, consider "Agent", which is a core term of the ABC
   vocabulary and hence a preferred term in the MetaNet thesaurus.
   Semantically equivalent terms for "Agent", commonly used within other
   metadata vocabularies, include:
   actor, contributor, creator, player, doer, worker, performer

 <p>  Possible narrower terms or hyponyms for "Agent" include:
   author, composer, artist, musician, . . etc.

<p>   Table 2 is an excerpt from the RDF Schema which illustrates the
   representation for the "Agent" metadata term as well as its equivalent
   terms and a partial hierarchy of its narrower terms.

   
 <p>  A Web search and browse interface to MetaNet has also been developed.
    Users can search on any common metadata term and retrieve a list
   of equivalent terms, broader terms and narrower terms. Figure 3 shows
   the results of a search on the term "author".

                          
<h>9 Linking MetaNet to XSLT

<p>   Using XSLT it is possible to parse an input XML description and for
   each element encountered call a Java procedural code extension which
   determines the equivalent term in the output domain from the semantic
   realtionships specified in the MetaNet thesaurus.

<p>   For example, suppose the Java program, Mapping.java, contains an
   extension function readMetaNet. For each element encountered during
   parsing of the input metadata description, the input element name
   (e.g. abc:Agent) and the output domain schema definition (e.g. the
   Dublin Core schema) are passed to the readMetaNet function. This
   function searches the MetaNet RDF Schema file for an element in the
   output schema definition that is equivalent to the input element name
   (e.g. dc:contributor), and returns this value. XSL creates a new
   output element with this name in the output description. Figure 4
   illustrates the program flowchart.

                           
 <p>  The XSL code in Table 3 illustrates how to call a Java extension
   function, readMetaNet, from the main XSL file.

   
<p>   Below is a high-level, simplistic algorithm describing the mapping
   process that is performed within the readMetaNet Java function in
   Figure 4.

   readMetaNet Java function in Figure 4


<h>10 Conclusions, Limitations and Future Work

 <h> 10.1 Conclusions and Limitations

 <p>  Our evaluation of XSLT for mapping between metadata descriptions from
   different domains revealed that although XSLT is good for syntactical
   and structural mapping, semantic mappings need to be hardwired into
   the code. Flexible semantic mapping is only possible with the
   assistance of semantic knowledge bases provided by ontologies or
   thesauruses such as the MetaNet thesaurus described above.

 <p>  The MetaNet thesaurus described here is a first draft English version,
   based on the vocabulary of the ABC model. Although it has only been
   applied to a relatively small sample set, some of the limitations of
   this thesaurus are already evident. These include its inability to
   support metadata vocabularies which use:
   
  <l>   * Tokens, e.g. ID3 tags such as TPE2, which are semantically
       meaningless. This limitation can be overcome by either explicitly
       including such tags in the thesaurus or searching the definitions
       (rather than element names) in the output namespace for the input
       element name or its semantically equivalent terms;
 <l>    * Abbreviations, e.g. acc.no.;
 <l>    * Qualifers or hybrid words joined by a variety of connectors, e.g.
       UserClass, Assistant Editor, Art_Director, Time-span. This problem
       can be solved to some extent by including "associated terms" in
       the thesaurus and by ignoring typical "connectors".

<p>   In addition, the inherently ambiguous nature of language leads to the
   following problems:
   
 <l>    * Metadata terms with multiple possible meanings, e.g."condition" -
       this could be the current state of an object or it could be a
       restriction on the permissable use of a resource. This can be
       overcome by the use of unambiguous metadata terms by schema
       designers.
 <l>    * Multiple possible spellings for the same word, e.g.
       artefact/artifact, colour/color.
 <l>    * This thesaurus is based on nouns, e.g. "creator", "publisher", and
       does not search for related verbs, adverbs, adjectives in various
       tenses which could be used to express the same semantics, e.g.
       "created_by", "published_by". This problem could, to some extent,
       be overcome through the use of stemming.

 <p>  Currently only English is supported. However, we believe that this
   thesaurus could be extended to provide equivalent or overlapping terms
   for the ABC vocabulary in other languages by following the
   recommendations specified in ISO5964. 

<h> 10.2 Future Work

 <p>  So far the ABC model has only been tested on a relatively small sample
   set. We intend carrying out more extensive evaluation of both the ABC
   model and the hybrid mapping approach, by applying them to metadata
   tranformations between large sets of sample records provided by a
   number of different CIMI  member organisations. The plan is to
   build a testbed using multimedia museum resources and metadata
   descriptions provided by CIMI members and to use this testbed to
   implement and evaluate metadata interoperability between different
   museums' descriptions.

 <p>  The Harmony ABC model exhibits many similarities with the CIDOC
   Conceptual Reference Model (CRM) , a domain ontology developed by
   the CIDOC Committee of the International Council of Museums. In the
   near future we plan to investigate the possible merging of the Harmony
   model and the CIDOC CRM model into a single ontology. We plan to use
   the CIMI testbed described above to evaluate the "super" ontology
   resulting from harmonization of these two models.

 <p>  The mapping implementations above have all involved mapping from an
   event-aware metadata model to a resource-centric metadata model. We
   are also interested in the rules and mechanisms required for machine
   translations between metadata descriptions based on different
   event-aware metadata models, e.g. from ABC to INDECS or CIDOC CRM.

 <p>  We would also like to investigate mapping between "application
   profiles" or schemas which mix metadata elements imported from
   multiple different namespaces. The test examples considered so far
   only present the problem of mapping from a single domain's metadata
   description to another single domain's metadata description, e.g. pure
   DC to pure MPEG-7. A situation that will become increasingly common in
   the future is the need to map from a schema which imports elements
   from multiple namespaces to another schema which imports a different
   set of elements from multiple namespaces. In addition, each schema may
   impose its own local
   
<l>     * structural constraints, e.g. parent/child relationships
<l>     * cardinality/occurrence constraints
 <l>    * datatyping, enumeration and formatting constraints on the element
       values.

 <p>  We believe the approach proposed in this paper will support mapping
   between mixed-domain "application profiles", but need to test this
   through further research involving machine translations between
   metadata descriptions which conform with both complex local usage
   constraints, as well as
   namespace-specific semantic definitions (defined by RDF Schemas).
