<h>   Autobiography of Alice A. Bailey - Appendix - The Principles of the
   Arcane School
 
<h> I. The Arcane School is a Training School for Disciples

<p>   At the close of the world war (1914-1945) the Arcane School had been
   in existence for nearly 25 years and had, in that time, serviced over
   20,000 people. Its curriculum is progressive; step by step the studies
   deepen and the meditation work becomes more intensive as the student
   passes from one degree to another.

<p>   No teaching is given at any time in the development of the psychic
   powers; people are not taught to be clairvoyant or clairaudient; no
   training is given in magic or in the use of magical rituals, and
   nothing is taught at any stage on sex magic. Our whole emphasis is
   laid upon spiritual living, upon the mental grasp of the occult
   teaching and upon those rules and processes which will bring about
   right relations to one's fellowmen, right relation to one's own soul,
   right relation to the Spiritual Hierarchy (of which the Christ is the
   Supreme Head), and right relation to a Master and His ashram, or
   group.

<p>   Because the Arcane School is designed solely to train people to be
   conscious, working disciples, its curriculum is definitely
   eliminative. The work you are asked to do is not easy, nor is it
   intended to be easy. The standard maintained and desired is high and
   the work is planned in such a way that those whose mental equipment
   and spiritual aspiration are inadequate to the requirements
   automatically drop out; they find, for themselves, that they cannot
   cope with the work. We never encourage people to stay in the work
   unless they show fitness, for they only get discouraged and labor
   under a sense of failure and this is bad for all concerned.

 <p>  Discipleship entails a loving heart and a keen, alert mind. The loving
   heart has always been emphasized, plus devotion, by the churches and
   the esoteric groups. This is a basic truth and necessity, but a keen,
   alert and trained mind is of equal importance. The Masters reach the
   world of men through their disciples; that is the way They choose to
   work. They are seeking, therefore, intelligent, [283] self-controlled
   men and women - with vision and with a self-imposed, spiritual
   discipline - through whom that work can be carried forward.
   Intentionally, therefore, we make the work difficult and keep the
   standard of requirements high because we, too, are looking for people
   who can use their minds or who show at least a willingness to develop
   and use their mental processes. The need of the more emotional and
   aspirational types and of the devotees can well be met in other groups
   and esoteric schools, and is thus being met.

<p>   Running through all the work of the Arcane School is the theme of
   service. Service to one's fellowmen is the hallmark of a disciple and
   the key also which opens for him the door of initiation. Therefore,
   all who enter the School and face the new cycle of training find us
   saying to them: Study, think and prove to yourself and to us that you
   have grasped the teaching by writing your study papers; learn to
   meditate and so make a contact with your true spiritual Self, the
   soul, and make service the expression of what you know. These three
   things should be your main spiritual preoccupation during the time
   spent in the earlier degrees. You will find that, as each year slips
   away, your grasp of the way into the Hierarchy grows steadily and your
   entire life will be taking on fuller and richer meaning. It is the
   world of meaning that we are trying to penetrate. You will then find
   that the succeeding degrees will open their doors to you, for you will
   be found to have covered the necessary preliminary work, to have
   assimilated a certain measure of technical and academic knowledge, to
   have certain spiritual contacts and arrived at certain great
   recognitions.
