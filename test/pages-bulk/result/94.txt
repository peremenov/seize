 <h>   From Bethlehem to Calvary - Chapter Five - The Fourth Initiation - The
   Crucifixion
   
 <p>   The difference lay in the point in evolution which humanity itself had
   reached. The cycle which Christ inaugurated has been one in which men
   have become strictly human. Up till that Incarnation there had always
   been those who, having achieved humanity, had then passed on to
   demonstrate divinity. But now the whole race is at the point of so
   doing. Although today men are predominantly animal-emotional, yet
   through the success of the evolutionary process - leading as it has to
   our widespread educational systems and the general high level of
   mental awareness - men have reached the point where the masses
   themselves, given proper encouragement, can "enter into the kingdom of
   God." Who can say that it is not this realization, dim and uncertain
   as it may be, which prompts the universal unrest and the widespread
   determination to better conditions? That we interpret the kingdom of
   God in terms of the material is inevitable at first, but it is a
   hopeful and spiritual sign that we are today so [192] busy cleaning
   house, and thus attempting to raise the level of our civilization.
   Christ incarnated when, for the first time, humanity was a complete
   whole, as far as the form side its nature was concerned, with all the
   qualities manifesting - physical, psychic and mental - which
   distinguish the human animal. He brought to us a manifestation of what
   the perfect man could be who, regarding that form side as the temple
   of God, but recognizing his innate divinity, strives to bring it to
   the foreground, first of all in his own consciousness and then before
   the world. This Christ did. The mysteries had always been revealed to
   the individual who fitted himself to penetrate into a hidden arcanum
   or temple, but Christ revealed them to humanity as a whole, and
   enacted the whole drama of the God-Man before the race. This was His
   major achievement, and this we have forgotten - the living Christ - in
   the emphasis we have laid upon man himself, on his relation to himself
   as a sinner, and to God as the One against Whom he has sinned.

 <p>   Again, every great organization or group religion or cult of any kind
   has originated with a person, and from that person the idea has spread
   out into the world, gathering adherents as time elapsed. Christ in
   this way precipitated the kingdom of God upon earth. It had always
   existed in the heavenly places. He caused it to materialize, thus
   becoming a fact to the consciousness of men.

 <p>   Preparedness for the Kingdom, and the arrival of the time when men in
   large numbers could be initiated into the mysteries, required from
   them a recognition of an unworthiness and a sinfulness which only the
   development of the mind could give. The age of Christianity has been
   an age of mental unfoldment. It has been an age also wherein much
   emphasis has been laid upon sin and evil doing. There is no
   consciousness of sin in the animals, though there may be indications
   of a conscience among the domesticated animals, due to their
   association with man. Mind produces the power to analyze a observe, to
   differentiate and distinguish; and so with the [193] advent of mental
   development there has been, for a long time, a growing sense of
   sinfulness, of contrition, and of an almost abject attitude to the
   Creator, producing in humanity that strongly marked inferiority
   complex with which today psychologists have to deal. Against this
   sense of sin, with its concomitants of propitiation, at-one-ment and
   the sacrifice of Christ for us, there has been a revolt; and in this
   really wholesome reaction there is the normal tendency to go too far.
   Fortunately, we are never able to get too far from divinity; and that,
   as a race, we shall swing back into a state of greater spirituality
   than ever before is the sincere belief of all who know. Theology
   over-reached itself with its "miserable sinner" complex and its
   emphasis upon the necessity for the purification by blood. This
   teaching of purification through the blood of bulls and of rams (or
   lambs) was part of the ancient mysteries, and was inherited by us
   primarily from the Mysteries of Mithra. These mysteries, in their
   turn, inherited the teaching, and thus formulated their doctrine,
   which Christianity absorbed. When the sun was in the zodiacal sign of
   Taurus the Bull, the sacrifice of the bull was offered as a forecast
   of that which Christ came later to reveal. When the sun passed (in the
   precession of the equinoxes) into the next sign, that of Aries the
   Ram, we find the lamb was sacrificed and the scapegoat sent into the
   wilderness. Christ was born into the next sign, Pisces the Fishes, and
   it is for this reason that we eat fish on Good Friday, in
   commemoration of His coming. Tertullian, one of the early Church
   Fathers, speaks of Jesus Christ as the "Great Fish," and of us, His
   followers, as the "little fishes." These facts are well known, as the
   following extract will indicate:

  <p>    "The ceremonies of purification by the sprinkling or drenching of
     the novice with the blood of bulls or rams were widespread, and
     were to be found in the rites of Mithra. By this purification a man
     was 'born again' and the Christian expression 'washed in the blood
     of the Lamb' is undoubtedly a reflection of this idea, the
     reference thus being clear in the words of the Epistle to the
     Hebrews: 'It is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats
     should take away [194] sins.' In this passage the writer goes on to
     say: 'Having boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of
     Jesus, by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us
     through the veil, that is to say his flesh... let us draw near...
     having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies
     washed with pure water.' But when we learn that the Mithraic
     initiation ceremony consisted in entering boldly into a mysterious
     underground 'holy of holies' with the eyes veiled, and there being
     sprinkled with blood, and washed with water, it is clear that the
     author of the Epistle thinking of those Mithraic rites with which
     everybody at that time must have been so familiar."

     133.

 <p>   Christ came to abolish these sacrifices by showing us their true
   meaning, and in His Person as perfect man He died the death of the
   Cross to show us (in picture form and through actual demonstration)
   that divinity can be manifested and can truly express itself only when
   man, as man, has died in order that the hidden Christ may live. The
   lower carnal nature (as St. Paul loved to call it) must die in order
   that the higher divine nature may show forth in all its beauty. The
   lower self must die in order that the higher self can manifest on
   earth. Christ had to die in order that once and for all mankind might
   learn the lesson that by the sacrifice of the human nature the divine
   aspect might be "saved." Thus Christ summed up in Himself the
   significance of all the past world sacrifices. That mysterious truth
   which had been revealed only to the pledged and trained initiate when
   he was ready for the fourth initiation was given out by Christ to the
   world of men. He died for all so that all might live. But this is not
   the doctrine of the vicarious at-one-ment which was pre-eminently St.
   Paul's interpretation of the Crucifixion, but the doctrine which
   Christ Himself taught - the doctrine of divine immanence (see St. John
   XVII), and the doctrine of the God-Man.

 <p>   Christianity inherited many of its interpretations, and the teachers
   and interpreters of the early Christian times were no more free from
   the thralldom of ancient beliefs than are we [195] from the
   interpretations given to Christianity during the past two thousand
   years. Christ did give us the teaching that we must die in order to
   live as Gods, and therefore He died. He did sum up in Himself all the
   traditions of the past for He "not only fulfiled the Judaic
   Scriptures, but He also fulfiled those of the pagan world, and therein
   lay the great appeal of early Christianity. In Him a dozen shadowy
   Gods were condensed into a proximate reality; and in His crucifixion
   the old stories of their ghastly at-oning sufferings and sacrificial
   deaths were made actual and given a direct meaning." (Ibid., p. 166.)
   But His death was also the consummating act of a life of sacrifice and
   service, and the logical outcome of His teaching. Pioneers and those
   who reveal to men their next step, those who come forth as the
   interpreters of the divine Plan, inevitably are repudiated, and
   usually die as the result of their courageous pronouncements. To this
   rule Christ was no exception. "Advanced Christian thinkers now regard
   the Crucifixion of our Lord as the supreme sacrifice made by Him for
   the sake of the principles of His teaching. It was the crowning act of
   His most heroic life, and it affords such a sublime example to mankind
   that meditation upon it may be said to produce a condition of
   at-one-ment with the Fountainhead of all goodness." (Ibid., p. 166.)
