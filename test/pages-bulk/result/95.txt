<h>   Discipleship in the New Age II - Personal Instructions to Disciples -
   I.A.P.
<h>   November 1944

 <h>  MY COMRADE AND MY BROTHER:

 <p>  These are two appellations which are sincere and intended. You are at
   this time facing changes. The choice with which you are confronted is
   not so much where you will work, but whether you have arrived at a
   high water mark in your developed life of service and can therefore go
   no further, or whether there are still to be found in you those
   springs of interest and those inner urges which will enable you to
   reach outward and further into the life of the spirit. [502] Such is
   oft the choice with which the disciple is faced who reaches close to
   the three score years and ten of ordinary human enterprise, as you do
   today. The difficulty lies in the fact that, fundamentally, either
   decision is right. Few, however, face the choice consciously or
   intelligently or, having made it, abide by the decision made. From the
   standpoint of the ordinary aspirant, the choice is relatively
   unimportant because the time equation is of no great moment at this
   stage; a few years more or less are of no import in the eternity of
   soul reaction. Therefore, a decision to relax, to hold the point
   gained, but to refrain from further struggle, has in it no room for
   criticism. Remember this.

 <p>  From the standpoint of the accepted disciple - such as you are - there
   may be more to the choice than at first appears. It might be of
   service to you, and to all who may later read these instructions, if I
   dwelt for a moment upon the inevitable problem of the working
   disciple, upon the problem of the man who reaches the age which you
   have reached. Shall he rest back upon his laurels (and you have
   laurels, my brother, as I pointed out in my last instruction to you)
   or shall he - to use a Biblical phrase - "gird his loins" anew and go
   forward with a fresh impetus and to a still higher summit of
   attainment? Shall he demonstrate the power of the seventh wave which
   will carry him forward much further upon the beach of life expression
   or will the strong undertow of ordinary human frailty pull him back
   from renewed effort?

 <p>  The reasons why a disciple must at least endeavor not to relax unduly
   and should push on in spite of fatigue (the fatigue of years of
   living), in spite of the increasing "creaking" of the human apparatus
   and the inevitable tendency which comes from constant service and
   constant contact with others, might be enumerated as follows:

 <p>   1. He must endeavor to carry the rhythm of service and of fruitful
       living with him when - free of the physical body - he stands upon
       the other side of the veil. There must be no gap in that service.
 <p>   2. He must endeavor as far as in him lies to preserve the [503]
       continuity of his consciousness as a working disciple and should
       allow no gap to emerge between his present point of tension and
       that point of tension which supervenes after the death experience.
 <p>   3. He must endeavor to close the episode of this life experience so
       that it is apparent that he is a member of an Ashram; he must
       permit no break in the established relationship, or any cessation
       to the flow of ashramic life through him to the world of men. This
       activity, on account of the natural and normal deterioration of
       the physical vehicle as it grows older, is not so easy a task; it
       requires a definite concentration of effort, thus increasing the
       tension in which a disciple ever lives.
<p>    4. For any disciple in my Ashram, the problem in this time of world
       crisis is peculiarly urgent, and this for the following reasons:
   <l>      a. My Ashram is the main affiliated Ashram with that of the
            Master K.H. To him, my Master (as I am yours), is given the
            task, on a large scale, of world education along new lines.
            Through my Ashram, working under the inspiration of his, the
            newer, esoteric presentation of truth is to be given out. The
            work that I have already done - through my books and through
            all the teaching which you have attempted to embody - is to
            render the teaching of the other and older esoteric schools
            and groups entirely exoteric. There is little left to them
            that is new; they must now link up with the sources which I
            represent if their leaders are to present fresh and vital
            information to their students, or they must take what I have
            conveyed to the world, via A.A.B., and thus again reintegrate
            into the esoteric whole.
   <l>      b. Disciples in my Ashram have a dual responsibility to stand
            steady in a preservation of realization - if I may use such a
            phrase. This steadiness must not be relaxed in any way as old
            age draws near, and it must not be permitted to disappear
            through the transition of death itself. It is through the
            [504] unbroken conscious thinking of a welded group of
            disciples that the Master of an Ashram works. It is not so
            much the active outer service of a group of disciples which
            is of major importance (though it has necessarily a vital
            purpose) as the coherent, integrated group thought which is
            so potent in effecting changes in the human consciousness.
     <l>    c. The peculiar problem of the present world crisis and the
            terrific readjustments in the human consciousness, incident
            to the inauguration of a new culture, civilization and world
            religion, warrant my presenting the members of my Ashram
            (even affiliated groups, such as yours) with the opportunity
            to preserve intact and free from all deterioration their
            "state of mind" throughout the remaining years of this life,
            through the process of dissolution, and on into the freedom
            of the other side of the veil. This preservation of conscious
            integrity is no easy task; it requires understanding and most
            deliberate effort.

 <p>      I call you, therefore, my brother, to exactly this effort. The
   consequences to you will be a much harder life of service from now on;
      the results will be the carrying out of your plans for work with
                        greatly intensified effort.

 <p>    You should now work in closer cooperation with A.A.B. and F.B. The
    task of carrying esoteric truth into Latin and Catholic America and
       southern Europe is no easy undertaking. It will be slow. Your
    foundation must be well and truly laid. The quality of those reached
     by you in the future is of more importance than the quantity. Bear
    this ever in mind. Relinquish not the various phases of the work you
    have so successfully launched, but proceed with them as heretofore -
    no matter where may be the place of your physical plane enterprise.

 <p>  One of the many things which you need at this time to learn, and which
    you must initiate during the next few years, is how to gather people
   together and work through them. This, as you have been taught, is very
    difficult for a first ray disciple to master, particularly when the
   soul ray  [505] and the ray of the astral or emotional nature are both
   first ray. It is easy for the first ray disciple to withdraw into his
   soul consciousness, far easier than for any other ray types, and your
   problem (as it is also the problem of J.W.K-P.) is to give the second
   ray personality fuller sway, and thus balance the first ray ability to
    demonstrate detachment by the functioning of the opposite quality of
   attachment - so distinctive of the second ray nature. Ponder on this.

   <p>      As I told J.W.K-P. some years ago, a "detached attachment"
      (paradoxical as it sounds) is the goal of the first ray working
   disciple. This is equally true of you. You and he have the same egoic,
    personality and mental rays. Hence the close link with him which you
     have ever realized. He is a disciple of the Master M., temporarily
       working in my Ashram. You have been admitted into the ranks of
   accepted disciples in my Ashram and by me, but you will eventually be
    transferred into the Ashram of the Master M. The free interplay thus
   established between my Ashram and that of the Master M. is due to the
     fact that he is the inner Head of all esoteric groups, and in the
   interest of the coming new world order, the teaching Ashrams are being
    strengthened by the inflow of first ray disciples. This should be a
                       point of real interest to you.

 <p>   What, my brother, shall be the type of meditation and interior work
     which you should be doing during the coming years? I would like to
       have you meditate upon the "three activities": Outward moving,
    persistent orientation, and interior withdrawing or abstraction. The
   relation of these three activities or three attitudes should form one
    aspect of your reflection upon these phrases; the relative activity
     involved in each attained position should constitute another; the
     effect produced by each of them in the three worlds, and also upon
      soul levels, demands careful and concentrated thought. What, for
   instance, is the nature of "outward moving" upon the astral plane? How
      would "persistent orientation" appear or express itself upon the
   mental plane? Or "abstraction and withdrawal" upon the physical level
   of consciousness? How can you, as a disciple, display these attitudes
     simultaneously? I think you will admit, my brother, that in these
   three [506] concepts and in their working out in the daily life within
   the ring-pass-not of the three worlds and in the life of the soul upon
   its own plane, I have given you the theme for much thinking during the
   coming years. Take each of these phrases, therefore, and think each of
   them out in relation to each of the three planes in the three worlds,
   and to each other; carry the same directed thinking on to soul levels
   and shift the theme then into the three worlds of the Spiritual Triad,
    regarding the lower three worlds then as reflections of the higher,
   triadal three. Keep notes of all the thoughts of reality which come to
   you;. watch the reactions produced in your vehicles of expression, and
    become increasingly aware of the changes which conscious, deliberate
   thinking will bring about in you. Think - if I may so express it - in
     your heart, and also in your mind, and endeavor to comprehend the
              distinction between these two modes of thought.

 <p>    This reflective work should constitute your meditation work in the
     future; it will condition your interior development and will also
               inevitably make your outer work more dynamic.

  <p>    One reason why I have emphasized the need for attachment in this
    instruction is that right attachment releases the love of the soul,
    and only love, consciously, intelligently and deliberately applied,
   can make for successful work, both in Europe and South America - your
     two recognized fields of service. Only your second ray personality
   will have the capacity to reawaken contact with your students in Spain
    or hold steady those already working in South America; it is through
    individually refound, reawakened and reinspired realization that the
   work, planned and intended by me, can be successfully carried forward.
   Such is your immediate task. Only your second ray personality can have
   the patience to cover the mass of detail needed and to persist in the
      face of apparent non-success. Much skill in action will also be
   required. The Catholic Church is governed by the first ray as its soul
    ray, and by the third ray as its personality ray. Hence its love of
    politics and of temporal power; hence also its intensely commercial
    and financial preoccupations. The mental ray of this Church is sixth
     ray. Hence its narrow one-pointedness: [507] its emotional body is
      also sixth ray in quality, whilst the physical ray of the outer
    Organization is seventh. These are points which should interest you
   and which you need to bear in mind as you work. A realization of this
    peculiar combination of rays will demand of you, and of all workers
                along esoteric lines, great skill in action.

<p>   With renewed endeavor, enlightened understanding and courage, go forth
    again, my brother, in the service of the light. I stand ever behind
   you. On that point, have no doubts. I shield and protect, but I leave
                             you free to work.
