<h>                             Internet listening
       
<p>   Being able to understand what is said in English in many different
   situations is essential. There is no mystery here; the more you
   listen, the more you will understand.
<p>   However, many students complain that they dont get enough
   opportunities to listen to spoken English. Well, wake up to the age of
   multimedia! Everything you need is on the internet and you can listen
   to whatever you want; songs, news, radio, sound tracks
<p>   Some resources are especially for esl (English as a 2^nd language)
   learners use them! Once you become more confident, start listening to
   sources for native English speakers; you will be surprised at how
   quickly you can progress, provided you listen regularly of course.

<p>   Here are just a few examples of what is available:

<p>   Extensive site including video & audio versions of news stories to
   improve your listening comprehension skills. You can listen to TV and
   radio broadcasts. Click on worldservice or radio.
   
<p>   Dont forget that CNN provides video and audio.

<p>   Voice of America (VOA), is an extensive site with lots of resources
   for listening. Several language versions are available. If you click
   on "special English" you find a webpage containing links to webcasts,
   dictionaries, foreign student services. If you click directly on
   webcasts and then on one of the themes (business, science etc) you
   will reach a page with the headlines of the audio material. Click on a
   headline that interests you & you'll find the script with the audio
   link.  However, remember that this site is government run.

 
<p>   This is a goldmine. Go directly to story archives & start exploring.
   You can listen and read at the same time, do comprehension exercises,
   work on vocabulary, and more.
<p>   What they say:
<p>   "Each module includes the full text of each story and interactive
   activities to test comprehension. The learner can choose to read the
   text, listen to the text, and view a short video clip of the story.
   Each module is designed for ease of use so the learner can use it
   independently."


 <p>  This is an excellent multimedia site. Check out 'video nation' which
   is a way to meet people from across the UK and hear what they say
   about their lives and the world around them. Watch the video clips and
   test your comprehension in Listen out! Check what you have heard by
   looking at the tapescripts.

<p>   Listening comprehension for all levels. Try it out!

<p>   Links to sites where you can listen to English, but some of the links
   dont work (e.g. voice of America)


<p>   This site allows you to listen to reports about topics relating to
   science & technology. Unfortunately, no tapescripts are available.


<p>   In the left-hand menu click on 'songs & lyrics'. Here you'll find a
   site that provides links to a new song every week. You can listen to
   the song, read the lyrics & do some language practice activities in
   relation to the song. You can also click on 'archives' to find a
   database of songs that have been worked on.
