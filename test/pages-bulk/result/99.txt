 <h>The Viability of Free Software Business Models

 <h>   by Hans Reiser



   <h>                             Service Contracts

<p>   Making your software free might DECREASE your service
   contractsrevenue.

 <p>  The free software movement is quick to cite service contracts as
   thebest way to make money from selling free software. There is a
   problemwith that.

<p>   Companies are quicker to spend money on service contracts
   forproprietary software.

<p>   The typical Linux software using company will have service contractson
   its Sun workstations including the software, and a hardware
   onlyservice contract on its Linux workstatons. It will have
   servicecontracts on Network Appliance fileservers, and, well, there
   isexactly one company (Lycos-Europe) with a large service contract
   onits ReiserFS fileservers.

 <p>  If a Linux using company does have service contracts on its
   Linuxworkstations/appliances, most of the time that money goes to
   someintermediary company which doesn't give any of the money to
   theauthors of the software being serviced.

 <p>  This is not rational economic behavior. The authors of the
   softwarewill indeed give much more expert advice than anyone else.
   They willprobably give it cheaper also. It makes no economic sense
   whatsoeverto be slower to buy a service contract on free software than
   onproprietary software if you use the free software.

 <p>  It is very real behavior though, and it is killing off many
   freesoftware companies. Sourceforge went proprietary because their
   salespeople couldn't sell service contracts for free software, and
   makingthe premiere version of the software proprietary made the
   servicecontract an easier sale. GFS, Bitkeeper, how many pieces of
   softwaremight have been free if the service revenues had been there?

<p>   This is deeply endangering the free software industry's
   fiscalviability.

 <p>  Why are they reluctant to pay for service on something that is free?

 <p>  I get several emails a day from users who want me to tell
   themsomething in our FAQ, or to diagnose that they didn't really
   recompilethe kernel module like they thought they did, etc. I am happy
   to dothis, but I think I should get paid for it quite honestly.

 <p>  We have a support page which has to have the lowest fee in
   theindustry, $25 a question, and we'll answer any Linux related
   question(though most of the ones we get are ReiserFS related quite
   naturally.)This support webpage gets used once every several days.

 <p>  I refer the emailers with user error problems to the support page.(Bug
   reports not in the FAQ we handle for free, though the proprietaryguys
   laugh and tell me that they charge for bug reports also.) Maybe40% of
   those emailers with user errors send me a flame back, angrythat I want
   money to answer a simple question that I know the answerto. They
   wouldn't send an email like this to their medical doctorexpecting a
   free diagnosis.

  <p> So we have a real problem in our industry. Economically
   irrationalbehavior by users is killing our industry's revenues, and
   itdemolished the business plans that all of those Linux VCs funded
   onceand swore to never fund another one looking like it again.

  <p> Where do we go from here?

  <p> The advantage that Gnu/Linux has is passion. We need some
   focusedpassion. If it is not logical, then we need to get going with
   thepsychological! If you believe in the value of the free
   softwaremovement, then you need go to the next IT purchases meeting at
   yourcompany or government lab, and ask if there is a service contract
   fromthe developers on all of the significantly used free software. It
   isthat simple.

  <p> We need to create a cultural norm in which it is considered
   properbehavior to buy service from free software authors with the
   samefrequency one buys it from proprietary software authors. The way
   todo it is to acknowledge we have a problem, and start telling
   peoplebeing irrational doesn't just leave you losing the cost of your
   time,it leaves you hurting a movement you care about.

 <p>  There are other ways also, but I don't find them as attractive.

<p>   My guess is that most of the reason the proprietary vendors sell
   moreservice contracts is that users are more inclined to buy service
   whenit is one more line on a contract than when it is a new contract.

<p>   An economist might be tempted to call this a transaction cost,
   andthink rational behavior is occurring, but beware that
   temptation!This marketing phenomenom holds true even for customers
   where the costof service would be hundreds of thousands of dollars.
   Rationaleconomic behavior for the customer company as a whole it is
   not.

<p>   We could for instance modify the license to require users topurchase
   zero or more dollars worth of service from the softwareauthors
   (including issuing a purchase order or supply a credit cardeven if the
   order is for zero dollars). I think that some of thosevendors whose
   free software business plan seriously depends on servicerevenue should
   consider experimenting with this. Alternatively, weshould just not
   depend on service revenue for the support of freesoftware businesses.

<p>   Perhaps one can better make substantial amounts of money fromservice
   if one's product is complicated enough. MySQL seems to bemaking that
   approach work. Namesys plans to add database andhypertext
   functionality to ReiserFS. It is possible that someday ourfilesystem
   will offer sufficient functionality that having a Namesysconsultant
   will be worthwhile for the average fortune 500 company. Inthat case
   the whole revenue model could snowball, with each consultantcreating
   more features, each new feature creating more customers, andthe end
   result could eventually be a company the size of Andersonconsulting
   advising companies on their information bases. While thereis nothing
   unique to open source about this, it is possible that opensource could
   allow a faster initial user adoption rate.

<p>   It is interesting that free software service revenue at this timeseems
   to encourage economic concentration. This is not veryencouraging if it
   holds true for the long term, and we end up withproprietary software
   locking out competitors from the source code, andfree software vendors
   either not giving any of the revenue todevelopers (most small vendors)
   or being highly concentrated largevendors who favor funding software
   internally developed andcontrolled. The only thing worse than a state
   controlled economy is amonopoly controlled economy.

<p>   Keep in mind that this is being written from a perspective in
   thedepths of the 2001 tech bust in which Namesys is managing "only"
   a100% annual growth rate due to the severity of the economy.
   WhileReiserFS usage is increasing by one or two orders of magnitude,
   allnon-governmental sources that were on the verge of increasing
   revenueby an order of magnitude disappeared as those customers entered
   intolayoffs.

  <h>      Free software is very effective as a market sampling methodology.

 <p>  That does imply though that one must segment one's market. One way
   tosegment the market is according to whether the software is
   integratedwith proprietary software. Our licensing policy says that if
   youmake money from charging for usage licenses, then we must make
   moneytoo. This allows Namesys to sell to fileserver vendors
   andproprietary software vendors who want to add proprietary
   improvementsto ReiserFS. All sales that Namesys has made in this area
   haveresulted from market sampling being very effective. It generates
   farmore revenue at this time than service does.

 <p>  Sales to proprietary OS vendors have not happened yet, but once
   theeconomy recovers this could change, and interest has been
   expressed.It takes just one sale of that size to make 8 years of work
   on a highrisk technological gamble pay off financially.

  <h>                                 Open Sales

 <p>  We could make proprietary optional plugins, with the core
   filesystemremaining GPL'd. An issue though is how to prevent the poor
   frombeing locked out of access to software. Software fees are usually
   setto what an average middle-aged man spending his boss's money at a
   UScorporation would be willing to pay. Currently the only
   reasonableoption for the poor for most software is to pirate their
   software.(Pirating can also serve as a form of anti-trust vigilante
   action whenthe judicial system is as corrupted as it is in the US.)
   Makinglicense fees proportional to storage hardware cost is the best
   way tohandle this.

 <p>  This still leaves us with the economic inefficiency that occurs when
   auser needs a spreadsheet three times a year, and he would like to
   usethe best one made, but the best one is priced appropriately for
   thosewho use it several times a week. I call this the focused
   taxationinefficiency.

 <p>  Most products are sold for more than their marginal cost because
   mostreal markets are only semi-competitive. Doing this distorts
   theeconomy. Software takes this distortion to its greatest extreme,
   andbest illuminates a longstanding inefficiency in real world
   semi-freemarket economics.

 <p>  I have an unproven hypothesis to put before you: The amount ofeconomic
   distortion is a function of not just the total dollar amounttraded and
   exceeding the marginal cost, but is a function also of theratio of
   price to marginal cost, and high ratios are "typically" moredistorting
   than low ratios, even if the total number of dollars ismade equal.
   Persons interested in discussing proving this hypothesisare encouraged
   to email me at reiser@namesys.com. If the hypothesisis true, then can
   we choose to defocus the disincentive?

 <p>  Can we avoid the serious disadvantages of a state controlled,
   ormonopoly controlled, economy, and avoid the focused
   taxationinefficiency at the same time? How can we lockout neither
   poorcustomers nor poor startup OS component suppliers?

  <p> I'd like you to consider the concept of open sales. In an open
   sale,users pay a fixed percentage of hardware costs as a fee for using
   asoftware pool. Users may use all software in the pool. The users
   arepresented with a random sample of those developers who contributed
   tothe pool, and asked to allocate their fee among the sample
   inproportion to their perceived utility.
  
 <h>  Benefits:
 <l>    * A defocused disincentive to use software. You may use the best
       ofanything in the pool.
 <l>    * Poor people can afford the fee.
 <l>    * More finegrained rewarding of developers in proportion to
       theirproductivity than traditional copyright law due to reduced
       transactioncosts.
 <l>     * More accurate rewarding due to assessment of value being madeafter
       usage.

   <h>                                Conclusion

 <p>  Open source is a niche we at Namesys enjoy inhabiting. Its
   productionis not motivated mostly by money. It is a gentleman's hobby
   for most,and a profession for some who aren't in it for the money. It
   islikely to remain a niche. As long as that is understood, a good
   timecan be had by all us mutant hairless monkeys. It is amusing to
   giveaway for free a filesystem faster than what a company worth
   billionsis able to write despite all their money. Life should be
   enjoyed.
